INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The principal investigator (PI) did not include a search for alternatives to procedures that may cause more than
momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals in protocol CalMI2-001. The protocol contained a reference to a
search, stating that the search was included in an appendix. The appendix was not attached to the protocol and the
Institutional Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved the protocol without ascertaining that an adequate search
was conducted. The PI was contacted during the inspection and stated that the appendix containing the search had
inadvertently been left out of the protocol.
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to review searches for alternatives to procedures that may cause more than
momentary or slight pain or distress to animals in order to assess that a reasonable and good faith effort was made
to determine the availability of alternatives or alternative methods to the procedures in question. The facility should
ensure that the IACUC conducts all Animal Welfare Act required reviews of activities related to the care and use of
animals prior to approving those activities.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Four IACUC approved protocols do not provide complete descriptions of the activities using animals.
Protocols CalMI2-001, CalMl2-005, CalMl2-006, and CalMl2-007 do not include incision lengths for a variety of
surgical procedures. Additionally, CalMl2-007 does not include a description of the size of a subcutaneous telemetrydevice to be implanted in animals.
Inadequate descriptions of activities using animals may prevent the IACUC from identifying deficiencies in activities.
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the investigator provides a complete description of proposed
activities that involve the use of animals in order that those activities may be adequately reviewed and determined
to be in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.
