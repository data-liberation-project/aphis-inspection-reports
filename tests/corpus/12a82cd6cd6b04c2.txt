2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female white exotic shorthair cat has dark material on the hair around both of the eyes. Closer examination of the
eyes revealed that the upper and lower eyelids appear slightly swollen and reddened. A wet, yellowish colored
discharge is attached the hair around both eyes and there is also a small amount of blood located in the inner and
outer corners of the right eye. This cat is not currently receiving any veterinary treatment for the condition of her
eyes.
Poor eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the cat and could lead to further health issues. This cat must
be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment plan. The
diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available for the inspector upon request. The
licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
