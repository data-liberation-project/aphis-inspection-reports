2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:45 on
05-Sep-17. Attempts to contact the licensee included voicemail messages left on the cell phone and home phone
numbers. After 30 minutes with no response, the inspector left the premises.
Lack of availability for inspection renders the regulatory process impossible. The licensee must ensure that a
knowledgeable facility representative is available during normal business hours to accompany the inspection.
Correct from this time forward.
