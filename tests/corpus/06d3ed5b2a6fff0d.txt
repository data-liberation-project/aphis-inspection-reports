ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, male, brown dachshund with chip number 067 538 814 has a thick buildup of tartar on all of his premolar and
molar teeth ("(cid:28)cheek teeth"(cid:29)) and on most of his canine teeth. The gums over all of the teeth are red and have
receded up away from the teeth and there is a creamy discharge at the gum line of some of the premolar and
canine teeth. There is one loose upper incisor tooth. These symptoms are consistent with dental disease in dogs.
Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the
ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The animal listed above must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the
condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. Correct by close of business 26
March 2016.
Adult, female, black and white French Bulldog with chip number 093 577 310 was seen by the attending
veterinarian (AV) on 21 January 2016 and was diagnosed with Keratitis Sicca. Treatment directions from the AV for
this dog were "Mild keratitis sicca can be managed by supportive care by cleaning with a moist cloth and application
of ophthalmic ointment with steroids as necessary." During the inspection today, the dog'(cid:25)s left eye has thick green
colored discharge on the cornea and a hazy appearance to the surface of cornea. In addition, the "(cid:28)white of the
eye"(cid:29) was red compared to the right eye. These symptoms are consistent with the need for cleaning and treatment.
The licensee stated that they are not using ointment in this dog(cid:25)'s eye at this time. Failure to treat a medical problem
according to the directions of the AV result in problems that continue to get worse and can cause pain for the dog.
The licensee must use appropriate methods to treat disease and injuries which includes treatment of diagnosed
medical problems as directed by the AV. Correct by close of business today.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO and Kendall
Lundy, ACI.Additional Inspectors
