ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230 on

I arrived at the facility at 12:30pm. The only available person at the facility was the licensee's underage son, who
stated that the licensee was unavailable.
