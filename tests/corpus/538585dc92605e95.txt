SANITATION.
The alley in the barn that runs along the front of the animal enclosures was extremely cluttered. In addition to the
food storage containers there were tools, a chicken coop, an unused animal crate and miscellaneous other things in
this area. Buildings and grounds must be kept clean and in good repair. This area cannot be adequately cleaned
with all of the clutter and is an excellent hiding area for all kinds of pests. This alley needs to have all of the
unnecessary stuff removed and then needs to be maintained in a clean and orderly fashion.
