HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On September 4, 2015, while attempting to shift the female zebra herd into their Lower Savanna display, a male
Thompson's gazelle (201663) was injured. After the male gazelle was anesthetized and examined by the zoo
veterinarian, the decision was made to euthanize the animal due to the poor prognosis for recovery. It appears from
review of zoo documents that animal handling protocols may not have been followed by zoo employees during the
shifting of animals to their outdoor exhibit yard on this day. Handling of all exotic animals must be done as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma. The gazelles were being held off
exhibit at the time of this inspection while zoo staff is updating the management plan for these animals. To be
corrected by: April 15, 2016.
This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on February 8 & 9, 2016.

Exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives on February 9, 2016.
