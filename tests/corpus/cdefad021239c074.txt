2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility’s program of veterinary care did not include written provisions and outlined care for the newly acquired
species. The written program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian regarding the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the written
program of veterinary care is available for review during all USDA inspections.
Each facility shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the applicant.

2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have complete acquisition records for the newly acquired Geoffroy’s cat. The complete name, address,
and license number of the person from whom the animal was purchased were missing.
Records containing the required information for animals acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring
born on premise, are necessary to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care


and use. The applicant shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition of all animals that fully and correctly
discloses the required information.

Contingency planning.
The facility has not documented a contingency plan. A plan is important to be in place in preparation for unexpected
disasters or events, as well a detailed strategy to address the needed handling, treatment, transportation, housing and
care of the animals in the event of an emergency or disaster. The facility shall develop and document an appropriate
contingency plan available for USDA review.

3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The outdoor enclosure housing one wolf hybrid has a housing structure and shelter constructed of wooden surfaces
where certain areas are no longer impervious to moisture. While the licensee treated all building structures in the
enclosure with a waterproof sealant, the ramp leading to the platform; the columns that support the platform; and the
housing structure are not resistant to water absorption.
Building structures made of unsealed wood cannot be properly cleaned or sanitized when permeable to moisture. The
licensee must ensure that all structures the animals come in contact with are impervious to moisture and able to be
readily cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they become worn or soiled.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.


The right side of the perimeter fence housing four red foxes has began to bow inward. The top edge of this fenceline is
now only two feet away from the primary enclosure due to the infrastructure caving in along the top border.

Having a perimeter fence in place protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from
going through it or under it, permitting contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally, it serves as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility.
The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact
between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Non-dangerous animals
housed in outdoor facilities require a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence around their enclosure and must be at least 3-feet away
from any enclosures or buildings.
