ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** An adult white tiger named Sampson was determined to be in need of veterinary care. On the right flank there
was a 2 inch (approximately) circular wound that was roughly 0.5 inch deep exposing the underlying tissue. The
edges of the wound appeared thickened. There was no blood or pus seen around the wound. The animal did not
show any signs that the wound or the flank was painful. The licensee was unaware of the wound and it had not
been treated. Animals not provided appropriate veterinary care will often not improve and may lead to the worsening
of the original condition along with secondary infections. Additionally, open wounds in the summer are vulnerable to
ectoparasites, such as flies. Correct by having a veterinarian examine, diagnose, and treat the described wound
above.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A white tiger named Sampson, mentioned above, was not provided proper daily observation. Daily observation
is needed to assess an animal(cid:25)s health and well-being. Failure to daily assess animals and report illnesses to a
veterinarian can result in injuries and diseases not being diagnosed and treated in a timely manner which can result
in the further progression of the illness or injury. Provide daily observation for all animals to evaluate their health and
well-being, and provide an accurate and timely means of communication so that all problems for all animals are
reported to a veterinarian.

FEEDING.
*** The metal feeder for three adult rabbits is dirty and requires cleaning. There is also food molded on the inside
flow control sleeve of the feeder. All feeders must be maintained in a sanitary condition, sanitized at least every 2
weeks, and measures must be taken to ensure there is no caking or molding of feed in the self- feeders. Dirtyfeeders and molded food can lead to disease or illness in the animals. Correct by cleaning and maintaining this and
all feeders.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***At least several dozen black flies were seen inside the room with the indoor portion of the adult male baboon
enclosure and in various other areas in the facility. The licensee did place a fly bait bag in the room, but it appears
to be ineffective. Flies are not only a nuisance for animals but can also carry and transmit diseases to animals
maintained by the licensee. A safe and effective pest control program must be established and maintained by the
licensee to minimize the presence of flies, which pose a risk of disease to the regulated animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The following areas were found in need of repair or replacement:
1.The floor of the fox enclosure housing 3 adult fox has 2 areas where the buried metal fencing has been exposed
by digging of the animals. The buried fence in these areas is also broken leaving areas where the animal(cid:25)s feet
may fall through or be injured.
2.The feeder for an enclosure housing 2 adult fox has rust around the edges of the feeding area and is also mildly
rusted on the top.
These areas are in need of repair or replacement. They are areas of potential injury or do not satisfy the
requirement to maintain all facilities in good repair. The facility must ensure that all animal enclosures are
maintained to adequately contain the animals, protect them from injury, and maintained in good repair.

3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although
an 8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, large mature trees remain within 3 feet of the
perimeter fence that have no preventives to stop an animal from climbing the trees and leaping over the perimeter
fence. One adult pig is also being housed in an enclosure that is within 3 feet of the perimeter fence. The height of
this enclosure is approximately 6 feet in height. A substantial perimeter fence that is maintained in good repair andnot less than 8 feet in height is required for all outdoor housing facilities that contain potentially dangerous animals.
Perimeter fencing protects the animals in the facility by ensuring in the event of an accidental escape there is a
secondary containment mechanism to prevent the animal from leaving the property and endangering public safety
thereby placing the animal's life in jeopardy. Correct by removing all building materials, enclosures, and other debris
that are in close proximity to the perimeter fence and altering trees in a manner to ensuring the perimeter fence can
adequately function as a secondary containment system.
