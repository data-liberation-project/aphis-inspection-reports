SANITATION.
There were three hedgehog cages which had an excessive buildup of excreta mixed with bedding material on the
floors of these cages. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained and to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of the enclosures should be
more frequent and effective to prevent the buildup of excreta.
