2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility has not ensured the attending veterinarian is making regularly scheduled visits to the premises. The Program
of Veterinary Care on file states the attending veterinarian will make biannual visits. The licensee stated the veterinarian
has not visited in a while and he does not have the finances to pay for a visit. The document that records visits was last
signed by the attending veterinarian on 1/29/21 (approximately 2 years ago).
Failure to ensure regular visits by the attending veterinarian can result in failure to recognize and treat health problems in
the animals.
Each dealer must employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements that includes regularly scheduled visits to
the premises.
