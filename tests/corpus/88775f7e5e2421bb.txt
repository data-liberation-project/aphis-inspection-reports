NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
The inspector arrived at the facility at approximately 12:00pm and after identifying herself to the licensee, the
inspector spoke with the licensee while preparing for the inspection. The licensee said that one of her dogs has
mammary tumors and has not been seen by a vet, but it was being euthanized by gunshot next week. The
inspector removed her camera from the vehicle and the licensee said, "(cid:28)You can'(cid:25)t take photos, I don'(cid:25)t allow that
here."(cid:29) so the inspector explained that photos were required of this dog, but the licensee continued to ask, "(cid:28)Why do
you have to take a picture of a dog I'(cid:25)m putting down next week?"(cid:29) Inspector responded to the question with the
same answer each time, yet the licensee continued to ask it; interfering with the inspection process.
During the time the inspector was at the facility she asked the licensee multiple times if she should start the
inspection or leave. The licensee would agree to the inspection and then tell the inspector to leave if she was going
to take photos. When the inspector asked for the final time if she should do the inspection, the licensee agreed to it,
but when the inspector said she would put any non-compliance items on the report, the licensee threw out her arms
and said, "(cid:28)Oh no, then I(cid:25)'m not letting you in!(cid:29)"
The licensee'(cid:25)s husband arrived and told the inspector, "(cid:28)You'(cid:25)re not taking photos here.(cid:29)" He then challenged the
inspector by asking, a minimum of four times,"(cid:28)How long have you worked here?"(cid:29) and then demanded to know why
the inspector wouldn'(cid:25)t answer the question. Licensee then aggressively said to the inspector, "(cid:28)All you do is come
here and give us trouble with the Animal Welfare people!(cid:29)" Inspector said, "(cid:28)No it'(cid:25)s not(cid:29)," and he angrily said,"
(cid:28)What do you do!(cid:29)" The inspector then entered her vehicle and left the facility at 1:24pm.
The line of questioning by licensee(cid:25)'s husband was an attempt to make the inspector feel incompetent and did not
pertain to the current inspection. The inspector felt that his statements referring to animal welfare people and
demanding to know, "(cid:28)What do you do!"(cid:29) were threatening and made the decision to exit the premises. The
licensee(cid:25)'s continued asking of the same question interfered with the start of the inspection and the inspector'(cid:25)s
ability to regulate the licensee(cid:25)s facility to enforce the Animal Welfare Act. Licensee shall not interfere with, threaten,
abuse (including verbally abuse), or harass any APHIS official in the course of carrying out his or her duties.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee failed to produce current Program of Veterinary Care. A written program of veterinary care is required
when the attending veterinarian is employed on a part time basis in order to ensure that animals are provided with
adequate veterinary care at all times. The licensee must establish a written program of veterinary care with the
current attending veterinarian.

2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee stated that one of her dogs had mammary tumors and had an appointment to be euthanized next week.
Upon further questioning by the inspector, licensee revealed that their routine method of euthanasia is gunshot.
Licensee told inspector that 6 to 7 dogs were scheduled to be euthanized by gunshot next week due to mammary
tumors, old age or failure to produce. Licensee could not produce current Program of Veterinary Care that would
show the facilities routine form of euthanasia. Licensee stated that they have always euthanized by gunshot and
she was allowed to do it by her former veterinarian, the State, and her former USDA inspector. The inspector
reviewed the program of veterinary care from 2004, completed by the former veterinarian, and discovered that she
had approved gunshot in "dire emergencies when the vet was unavailable." Inspector informed licensee that
euthanasia by gunshot was not acceptable.
Euthanasia by gunshot can cause unnecessary pain and distress to the dog. According to the 2013 AVMA
(American Veterinary Medical Association) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals, gunshot is not an acceptable
form of euthanasia for dogs. The licensee must stop using this form of euthanasia immediately and consult with the
attending veterinarian to establish a method of humane euthanasia as defined by AVMA Guidelines for the
Euthanasia of Animals.
Correction date: Immediately
