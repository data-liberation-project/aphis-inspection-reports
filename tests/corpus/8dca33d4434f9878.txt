eye lid, the top of the eyelid, and on the surface of the eye. The brown, crusty material is also attached to the hair

The facility representatives had not noticed the condition of these dogs and neither dog was currently receiving any
treatment for their eyes. Poor eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the dogs as well as, lead to further
health issues.
The above mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the
