ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A female Border Collie (083) had a red lick spot on her right front paw. Upon closer observation there was a 1.5
inch long and 1/2 inch wide lesion on the top of her right front paw. The skin in this area was reddened and along
the edges of wound was blackish dried matter. According to the licensee, they were not aware of the lesion until the
inspector pointed it out. This lesion could be the result of an injury, infection, illness or other veterinary medical
condition which may cause discomfort. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding this
animal's condition and to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Temperature.
***The big kennel building was not sufficiently heated. The ambient temperature in the kennel was 34-36 degrees
F. There is a gas heater in the building and also lamps hung above the enclosures. All nine enclosures had ice in
the water receptacles, affecting 17 dogs. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing sufficient source to keep
warm increases the risk of stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. The licensee must ensure all areas of the
kennel building must be kept at 45-85 degrees F .

receptacles were frozen solid and had lick spots in the ice where the dogs were attempting to drink. After the
inspector instructed the licensee to provide water to the dogs. A Golden Retriever drank continuously for 1 minute
40 seconds. Lack of water could cause the dogs to become dehydrated or other health issues. The licensee must
provide and ensure that all dogs have access to fresh water twice a day for at least an hour each time, or moreoften if necessary to ensure the dogs do not become dehydrated or succumb to other potentially serious health
issues.
