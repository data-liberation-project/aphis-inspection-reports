HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two enclosures on the north side of the main kennel have tin along the top of the dog doors. This tin is protruding
outward into the enclosures causing a sharp edge. The edges are approximately eye level of the dogs in the
enclosure in normal standing position. The five dogs in these two enclosures could be injured on these edges.
All enclosures must be free of sharp jagged edges that could injure the animals.

3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* One enclosure the north side of the main kennel has tin along the top of the dog door. This tin is excessively rusty
and cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. Without proper cleaning and sanitization, the disease potential can
be increased for the three dogs in the enclosure.
All metal surfaces must be maintained and kept free of rust. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization and
the prevention for the potential of diseases affecting the dogs. This will maintain the structural strength of the metal
surface.
