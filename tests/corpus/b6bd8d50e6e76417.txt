INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Significant changes were made to protocol 18187 without prior approval from the IACUC (Institutional Care and Use
Committee).
According to the IACUC approved protocol, rabbits were to be tranquilized with acepromazine prior to anesthetic
induction with ketamine. According to rabbit anesthesia records and confirmed verbally by facility staff, rabbits were
not being tranquilized with acepromazine prior to induction and xylazine was added to the ketamine for anesthetic
induction. These changes were made without the knowledge or approval of the IACUC.
According to the same protocol: "(cid:28)If clinical alterations are noticed during any of the observation periods animals will
be euthanized immediately."(cid:29) One rabbit had substantially elevated physiologic parameters, notably respiratory rate.
Additional anesthesia was provided per the protocol, but these parameters remained elevated. The cause of the
elevated physiologic parameters was unclear. The rabbit was not euthanized until the conclusion of the
post-operative monitoring period.
Significant changes in the care and use of animals in ongoing activities may adversely affect animal well-being. The
IACUC should review proposed significant changes to activities involving animals prior to the implementation of the
activities.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A rabbit undergoing surgery (protocol 18187) died while under anesthesia when a pop up valve was inadvertently
left in a closed position. Staff has since been retrained and the valves have been replaced with ones that are in a
default open position. Research facilities should establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care which ensure that
appropriate methods are used to prevent injuries to animals.
This non-compliant item was corrected at the time of the inspection.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT NONHUMAN PRIMATES.
On 6/20/2016, an approximately 10 kg macaque was able to escape a transport enclosure by bending a metal
sliding door. The animal was tranquilized using a dart gun and subsequently captured. The animal was transported
to the facility veterinary clinic where she was examined by a veterinarian and underwent medical tests, treatment,
and monitoring. The animal was observed to be in declining health later the same day and was euthanized.
According to a pathology report, the animal'(cid:25)s health was compromised by damage to one kidney with subsequent
internal bleeding. Abdominal radiographs were taken after capture and were unremarkable. The incident was
self-reported and the facility is currently reinforcing transport enclosure doors. This enclosure design had been used
by the facility for several years without incident.
Transport enclosures should be strong enough to contain nonhuman primates securely in order to prevent the
animals from escaping. The facility should ensure that all nonhuman primate transport enclosures are of sufficient
strength to contain the animals.
Correct for all transport enclosures by August 28, 2016.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
