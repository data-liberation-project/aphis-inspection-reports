Records: Dealers and exhibitors.

and one pig. Additionally, no disposition records were available for three Bennett wallabies; two brown lemurs; one
common marmoset; two goats; five guinea pigs; two alpacas; two mountain coatis; one African crested porcupine; and

that fully and correctly disclose the required information.
