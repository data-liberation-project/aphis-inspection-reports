On June 30, 2016 Qatar airlines shipped 2 puppies from South Africa to Dallas/Ft Worth. A Customs and Border
Control Officer contacted USDA when the consignee did not meet the flight on arrival. On July 5th USDA attempted
to follow up on these puppies. According to Qatar employees the puppies were held at Qatar cargo for greater than
24 hours and eventually picked up by the consignee. When USDA requested records confirming the shipment,
length of time in transit, and confirmation of proper care, feeding, and housing until the puppies were released to the
consignee Qatar was unable to find any records associated with the puppies. Qatar requested time to find the
records and confirmed they would send via email or fax. As of July 15, 2016 those records have not been supplied.

the enforcement of the provisions of the AWA. The information shall be furnished within a reasonable time.

reasonable time (within 1 or 2 days).To be corrected immediately.
