and in their throats. Indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently ventilated at all times when dogs are present to
minimize odors, ammonia levels and provide for their health and well-being.

3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
3.11 b 2 Cleaning, Sanitization, Housekeeping, and Pest ControlThere is a buildup of dirt on the walls of the dog enclosures in the whelping barn. These walls should be cleaned
and sanitized every two weeks to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, and other disease hazards.
Also, in the whelping barn, there are food and water bowls that have been chewed around the top edge. The edge
has become jagged and pitted, allowing dirt and grime to penetrate into the surface of the bowls. This does not
allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the bowls. The bowls should be replaced or altered in a manner that
allows for proper cleaning and sanitization to occur every 2 weeks.
