Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
A four month old, male maltipoo (maltese/yorkie) arrived at PHL from ORD in a transport enclosure that did not have
markings on one or more sides with the words "Live Animals" in letters at least 1 inch in height, and with arrows or
markings to indicate the correct upright position of the enclosure (see Air Waybill # 001ORD68877955).

Carriers and intermediate handlers must not transport live animals unless the primary enclosure is clearly marked on top
and on more sides with the words "Live Animals" with letters at least 1 inch in height, and with arrows or other markings to
indicate the correct upright position. Failure to label primary enclosures properly can result in animals being transported
incorrectly and can put animals at risk for injury.

This inspection was conducted with an airline representative and exit interview was conducted with the manager.
