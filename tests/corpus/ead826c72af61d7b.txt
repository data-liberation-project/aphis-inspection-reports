***Wolf Trailer (3 exhibit wolves): The ambient temperature inside the trailer between the hours of 1:30pm and
5:30pm varied in range from 93-98 degrees Fahrenheit, despite 4 fans and a small portable air conditioner. The
wolves (3) were noted to be panting. Temperatures in mobile transport vehicles must be cooled in a manner that
prevents temperature extremes. Measures must be taken to sufficiently cool the trailer for the health and well-being
of the wolves. Correct by August 16, 2015.

temperature in addition to providing other means in which the animals can cool themselves.
