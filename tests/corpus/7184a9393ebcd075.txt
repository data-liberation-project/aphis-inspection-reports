SANITATION.
In the food preparation room, there was a moderate accumulation of dust on an overhead vent. The presence of
dust and other debris can potentially contaminate the diets fed to the marine mammals.
Portions of the floors are stained and do not appear to be sealed. There are areas around the base of the walls
where the paint/sealant has peeled off and the underlying material is exposed.
The regular cleaning and maintenance schedules for the food preparation room should include the overhead vents
to help minimize the risk of food contamination. All surfaces in this room, including floors and walls, should be
maintained in good repair to ensure all surfaces can be clean and sanitized as required.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
In an off-exhibit holding area where covered animals are currently being housed, there are areas of the flooring
where the paint has peeled off and the underlying concrete surface is exposed. The concrete is porous and cannot
be cleaned and sanitized as required. Surfaces in animal areas should be maintained in good repair to allow the
required cleaning.
