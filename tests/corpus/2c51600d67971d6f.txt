2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Last fall when a goat "Flynn" was losing weight, blood tests were run and the levels indicated the possibility of
Johnes' disease. When the vet wanted to test the fecals of the group to determine if the goat in fact had the
disease, the previous animal curator denied the testing. Per this regulation, the attending veterinarian needs to be
given the appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care is provided. This would include
the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries including fecal testing.
This needs to be addressed for the health of the animals.

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The enclosure that the arctic fox is in does not have sufficient distance between the barrier and the enclosure.
The inspector was able to reach over the barrier and have direct contact with the enclosure and potentially the
animal. This barrier needs to be addressed to have sufficient distance for the safety of the fox and the public.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The rabbit in the education area is housed in a large metal tub. An area of the tub at the bottom is rusted and
this no longer enables the enclosure to be effectively cleaned and sanitized. This enclosure needs to be addressed
for the health of the animal and to facilitate husbandry practices.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The diet kitchen area used to store food and prep all diets for the facility needs to be addressed. The table used
to prep diets for all animals including the non-human primates is made of wood that is no longer sealed and is worn
to the point it can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized which does not protect the food supplies from
potential contamination. This table needs to be replaced to provide an appropriate place to prepare diets for the
health of the animals.
