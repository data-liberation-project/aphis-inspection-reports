2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has some formal arrangements with a veterinarian, however it is very limited and does not include
information such as: Species of animals on the facility, adequate programs for parasites both internal and external,
capture and restraint methods, diet plans, euthanasia type, contact information for emergencies, and how often the
attending veterinarian will visit the facility. Without properly completed formal arrangements with a veterinarian
there is no way to ensure that animals are receiving adequate care. Complete formal arrangements with a
veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are no written records annotating where animals on the facility were acquired from. Without adequate
records keeping, there is no way to properly track animals acquisition or disposition. Create a written inventory of
animals with all pertinent information required.
3.75(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The primary enclosures housing the brown lemurs are constructed of black metal panels on the upper half. In
multiple areas the bottom of the panels in both enclosures are excessively rusted. Many of the rusted sections flake
to the touch and the damage is extensive enough to result in holes in the metal. Some of these areas have been
covered with black paint, however there is still structure deterioration. This level of deterioration likely impacts
structural integrity of the enclosure.
* In the enclosure housing 2 macaques, the top is held in place by strips of wire, many of which are excessively
rusty. The top of the enclosure is visibly bowing down in the front. This poses a safety hazard and a potential for
escape.
Housing facilities must be designed, constructed and maintained in a manner to be structurally sound and protect
the animals from injury. Housing facilities must be kept in good repair. The damaged areas above should berepaired or replaced.
3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The enclosure housing 2 spider monkeys contain a large car tire hanging from the top of the enclosure used as
enrichment. The surface of the tire has a greenish layer of organic material covering it. All surfaces that come in
contact with non-human primates must be cleaned and sanitized as necessary to minimize opportunity for disease
transmission and meet acceptable husbandry standards. A program should be implemented to address cleaning
and sanitizing of all surfaces inside enclosures that come in contact with the animals.
3.75(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The refrigerator currently being used for non human primate food had several dark colored puddles or liquid and
splashes of liquid on the shelves and walls. There was a bottle of alcoholic beverage being stored with the animal
feed. There is a risk of contamination if food is not properly stored in a clean environment. Sanitize the animal food
storage area and ensure that no other items are stored on or around them.
3.78(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
An enclosure housing 2 adult macaques has only one small plastic shelter which is not large enough to house both
animals at the same time without discomfort to the animals. The is a risk of health and safety by not providing
animals with shelter from the elements. Adequate shelter for all animals in outdoor enclosures must be provided.
Provide enough shelter to adequately house all animals in the above mentioned enclosure.

3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
No plan for environment enchantment as been created or implemented for any of the primates in the facility.
Primates are currently being housed both signally and in groups. Without an adequate plan directed by the
attending veterinarian there is no way to tell if primates are receiving the enhancements and social enrichment
required per species. A plan must be created, authorized, and implemented to ensure adequate enrichment for
primates.
3.84(c) REPEATCLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*A Piece of plastic was noted on the floor of the lemur enclosure.
*Multiple items of trash such as construction material, plastic bags, and unused tools were seen inside the perimeter
fence around primary enclosures.
Trash or chemicals, if accidently ingested by the animals could cause serious life threatening illness. Unused tools
or construction items could potentially pose a health or safety hazard and can house pests. Premises, including
housing facilities and primary enclosures must be kept free of trash and discarded materials to meet acceptable
housekeeping standards and protect the animals from injury.
3.84(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The licensee stated that he has no pest control program in place. During this inspection numerous small flying
insects and small black crawling insects were noted in the sugar glider buildings.
An effective pest control program appropriate for the non-human primates housed outdoors should be designed and
implemented in order to treat and control applicable pests including insects. Insects can facilitate disease
transmission as well as cause distress to the animals from biting or swarming.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are excessive amounts of rust on many of the sugar glider cages and cage stands. Excessive rust can affect
the structural strength of the cage and impair adequate sanitation. The rust on these cages needs to be removed
and any defects caused by the rust repaired or these cages and stands need to be replaced in order to adequately
protect the animals from injury and illness and to contain the animals.
There is a tear in the floor of the sugar glider building on the left that is exposing a large section of subfloor. This
damaged section may not be able to be adequately sanitized. The floor must be repaired or replaced in damaged
sections.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*The facility perimeter fence is leaning, loose and a gap exists at the bottom of the main entrance that can allowsmall animals to pass through. There are at least two areas in which gaps exist between the sugar glider buildings
and the perimeter fence.
*On the north end of the facility there are 2 areas between the lemur enclosures and the perimeter fence that are
not at least 3 feet apart, making it hazardous to walk between.
*The entrance to the perimeter fence was open at the start of the inspection causing it to be ineffective.
The perimeter fence must be kept in good repair and kept closed to prevent unwanted animals and persons from
gaining access to the facility, and to function as a secondary containment system in case of animal escape. Visual
and physical access to the fence must be maintained so that the fence can be inspected for structural integrity and
repairs.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
Multiple plastic water bottles in throughout the first sugar glider building had a brownish hazy organic material
sticking to the inside walls of the receptacles. Water can become contaminated if given to animals through a
receptacle that is not properly sanitized. Sanitize or replace water receptacles.
