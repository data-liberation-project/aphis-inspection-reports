FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the smaller hospital pens, a mother and kid were housed in a pen together. There is a gap in the chain link
fencing on the door of the enclosure large enough to allow the young goat's head to pass through the hole in the
chain link, which he was observed doing during inspection. The gap is intended for personnel to reach the latch,
and it is atypical for the facility to house young animals. Gaps may cause injury to the animals such as entrapment
of a body part such as a head, or escape of the animal from the primary enclosure.
All primary enclosures must be structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and contain them safely. A system to identify and correct potentially hazardous facilities must be in place.
Correction date: 20 August, 2017.

SANITATION.
In the holding area, there was a large collection of flies, despite fly control bags present in the area. In the nearby
pen, a female goat was constantly twitching her face and had flies resting in her nostrils. Flies can transmit disease
and can be irritating to the animals. The facility must establish and maintain an effective method of pest control.
Corrected during inspection with new fly traps and applying fly spray to the individual animal.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
