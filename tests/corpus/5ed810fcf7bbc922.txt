3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
-One prairie dog had escaped its enclosure and was not contained in an enclosure at the time of this inspection. Four
deep prairie dog sized holes were noted around the playground area and the animal was seen in that area. Not being
contained puts the animal at risk of injury, predation and malnutrition.
-One enclosure containing four goats, one sheep and one potbelly pig had a 2” screw protruding vertically from the top of
a stair rail where the rail cap had been dislodged. The goats in this enclosure could injure themselves on this exposed
screw.
-The fence between the enclosure holding two sheep and the one with four alpacas has at least 4 areas where the welded
4x4 hog panel wire had come unwelded and protruded horizontally into the enclosures. These long, sharp wires put the
animals contained in these enclosures at risk for injury.
--Outdoor facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
contain the animals. Correct by April 1, 2021.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.


-The indoor enclosure housing the tamandua has excessive dark grime build-up along the window ledge, at the nest box
area, and at the door that leads to an adjacent outdoor enclosure. Excess build-up of grime can lead to disease hazards
and pest concerns. Primary enclosures shall have excreta removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards. Correct by March 27, 2021.

--This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
