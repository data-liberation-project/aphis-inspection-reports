3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The pig enclosure has a picket fence, approximately 16 inches high, that runs inside at the bottom of the woven wire
enclosure. This fence is on the East and West sides of the enclosure. This fence has lost some of the pickets. Nail
heads are now exposed where the pickets were. The picket fence inside the llama pen also has a several boards
missing with a few nail heads being exposed.
The fencing must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
fencing, pen and sheds must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals. A program is needed to routinely inspect and repair the fencing, the pen and the structures within it.
The general citation (Section 3.125(a) Facilities, general, structural strength) was cited on August 11, 2014. And, it
was to be corrected by September 1, 2014. This is a repeat of the general citation.
