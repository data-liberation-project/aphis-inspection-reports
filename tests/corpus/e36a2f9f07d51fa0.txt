SANITATION.
a) Cleaning of Enclosures.
The litter box in the ferret enclosure had a large amount of dried fecal matter stuck along the inside walls of the
container. The litter appeared to have been changed within the past 24 hours, but the fecal matter on the walls of
the litter box appeared to be several days old. Fecal matter can cause odors and can harbor diseases that can
affect the health of the animals. The licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from primary enclosures as
often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, to minimize disease hazards, and to reduce odors.
