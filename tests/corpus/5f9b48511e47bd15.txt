Health certification and identification.
In September and October 2020, the licensee purchased two adult marmosets (1 male, 1 female), one infant male squirrel
monkey, and 9 adult Savannah and Bengal cats from a dealer in Tennessee and transported the animals to the licensee's
facility in Alabama. The licensee did not obtain health certificates for the animals prior to transport, and health certificates
were not provided by the seller.

Examination of nonhuman primates and cats by a licensed veterinarian within 10 days prior to transportation in commerce
is important for identifying any infectious diseases or physical abnormalities in the animal that may endanger the animal,
other animals, or the public.

Correct on October 23rd, 2020, by obtaining veterinary examination and health certificates within 10 days prior to
transporting nonhuman primates or cats in commerce.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
