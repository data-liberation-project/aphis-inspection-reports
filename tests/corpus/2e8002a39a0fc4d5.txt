FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is an area of the perimeter fence that surrounds the two bobcat enclosures that is approximately 7' in length
around a corner and measures 5'8" in height. The perimeter fence has been constructed this way for several years,
however, the ground has settled causing the perimeter fence to sink. The enclosure containing the bobcats is fully
enclosed with a top. The licensee has expressed interest in rebuilding this entire area. In the short term, the
licensee plans to use some available portable fencing to reinforce and provide adequate height to the fence.
Perimeter fencing is important as it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. In addition, it must be
high enough to act as a secondary containment area for the enclosed animals. The licensee must ensure that all
areas of perimeter fencing are at least 6 feet in height for the bobcat area or have the fencing and height approved
through the Administrator.
This was a focused inspection to recheck the status of the perimeter fence for the two bobcats identified on the
inspections conducted on 3/9/15 and 8/3/16.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
