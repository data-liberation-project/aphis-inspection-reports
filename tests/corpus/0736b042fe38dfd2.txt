3.56(b)(3)
SANITATION.
During inspection of building K, it was made known by staff that the cage wash was not functioning properly but was
still being used to sanitize the primary enclosures of 3 white rabbits. According to staff, the instrument used to
measure the temperature inside the cage wash was not functional, and maintenance was having difficulty in finding
the correct part to fix the cage wash; however, the cage wash was still being used as the primary means to sanitize
the rabbit's enclosure. In the cage wash records, the last temperature test strip used was marked on April 29th
2014. When questioned about the reason temperature test strips had not been used since, the staff said it was
because the cage wash would not consistently reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit. A detergent called Steris CIP 200 (a
clear fluid in white container) was also being used in the sanitation process, but no disinfectant was used for the
primary enclosure. By not having a cage wash that can reliably reach 180 degrees Fahrenheit or not using a
disinfectant, the rabbit primary enclosure cannot be appropriately sanitized. Proper sanitization is vital in removing
harmful pathogens that can serve as an opportunity of infection for the animals in the enclosure. Proper sanitization
removes all sources that promote pathogen presence and growth. The rabbit(cid:25) primary enclosure must be sanitized
at least every 30 days by either hot water (180 degrees Fahrenheit) with a detergent or using a detergent followed
by a disinfectant.
