3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fencing on the north side of the enclosure in the center of the zoo housing camels and llamas still has not been
repaired. The top of the wire fencing is damaged, it is loose and has bent wires with broken ends and sharp points.
The bottom of the wire fencing that was also cited back in August for this same enclosure could not be observed
due to snow. Enclosures that are not properly maintainted could allow aniamals to escape or cause injury.
Enclosures must be maintained so that they are structurally sound and free of sharp points, broken ends, and loose
wires.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A perimeter fence still has not been constructed around the north, west, and east sides of the coatimundi enclosure.
Lack of perimeter fence does not protect the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons
from having contact with the animals housed at the facility. Also, without a perimeter fence there is no secondary
containment system. A six foot high perimeter fence must be provided for this enclosure to keep unauthorized
people and animals from coming in contact with the animals on exhibit and provide a secondary containment
system in the event of an escape.
The ring-tailed lemurs are currently not being housed in their outdoor enclosure.
This was a focused inspection on the animals.
This inspection was conducted with a facility representative and the exit interview was conducted with the owner.
