Water quality.
A 6-year-old adult neutered male California sea lion (“Jester”) had a history of recurrent medical problems affecting his
eyes. On November 14th, 2019, Jester was examined by the attending veterinarian and the presence of a large corneal
ulcer was noted on the surface of his left eye, and trainers noted that the animal was “not eating as regularly as before”.
On February 11th, 2020 his left eye was noted to be worsening (“corneal ulcer subjectively seems deeper”), and he
continued to receive treatment by the attending veterinarian. He underwent surgery on his left eye on March 5th, 2020 at
which time it was noted that lesion was a “desmetocoele” (very deep eye ulcer). At the time of surgery, his right eye also
had a bluish grey lesion on its surface which was not ulcerated. Jester died under anesthesia.
Water quality records from the pool where Jester was housed consistently had total chlorine levels of 2.2 parts per million
(PPM) and free chlorine levels ranging from 0.1 PPM to 0.95 PPM in the month before his death. Free chlorine exceeded
0.5 PPM every day, often multiple times each day, from February 8th, 2020 to February 25th, 2020. The highest free
chlorine measured during this timeframe was 0.95 PPM free chlorine on February 18th, 2020.
Facility management stated that the general aim for water on this system is to maintain free chlorine in the 0.3 to 0.5 PPM
range in order to kill coliforms (bacteria). Facility records indicate that this target was lowered to the “0.2 range” on
February 26th because Jester was being prepared for surgery and they wanted to “fix anything and everything” leading up


to the surgery. Facility management stated, “there is no question that chlorine is irritating to the eyes.” From February
26th to March 5th the free chlorine was often in the 0.2-0.3 PPM range, while total chlorine remained around 2.2 PPM.
The consulting ophthalmologist confirmed that many of the other animals at the facility have eye problems. The attending
veterinarian confirmed that 4 out of 5 sea lions on this water system have ocular issues, all of whom are under 10-years-
old. Jester had been living at the facility since 2015, and he did not have any eye lesions when he arrived at the facility.
A USDA marine mammal specialist visited the facility on August 27th, 2019 and the specialist told facility management
that the chlorine was too high and needed to be reduced to better support animal health. At that time, facility management
indicated that their chlorine levels were maintained at less than 1 PPM total chlorine.
Since June 2020, records from this water quality system show that total chlorine was often more than 1.5 PPM, and was
regularly above 1.8 PPM. Records show that free chlorine often regularly exceeded 0.5 PPM.
Chlorine may contribute to the development and worsening of eye disease in captive sea lions. Chlorine and its
byproducts are extremely irritating to eyes and mucus membranes, yet captive sea lions depend on pools of water in their
enclosure to maintain normal body temperature and to exercise normal behaviors. Ulcers, infections, and inflammation on
the surface of the eye are extremely painful and may cause vision loss, and may affect an animal’s willingness or ability to
eat, swim, ambulate, or rest comfortably. Animals with ulcerated eyes are especially vulnerable to the pain and irritation
caused by exposure to chlorinated water. Sea lions are a high anesthetic risk, so eye problems that progress to a level
where anesthesia or surgery is needed are especially hazardous to the animals’ health and longevity.
Correct by maintaining appropriate levels of chlorine in marine mammal enclosures or an alternative system to maintain
ideal water quality so there is no detrimental effect to the health of the animals contained therein. Temporary correction
due by April 2nd, 2021, permanent correction due by May 31, 2021.
