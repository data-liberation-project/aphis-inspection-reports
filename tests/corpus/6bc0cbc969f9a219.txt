2.40(b)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) states that both the domestic cats (Savannah cats) and the exotic cats
(servals) should be treated with monthly topical flea prevention medication. The written documentation of treatments
provided to the inspector shows that the treatments were administered last at the end of May. No treatments were listed
for June or July. The inspector asked the employee if the cats had been treated since May and was told no. The inspector
asked the employee if they had the preventatives listed on the PVC by name and the employee didn't recognize the name
and she stated they did not have them on site. The Attending Veterinarian had stated at a previous inspection (April
2022) that she expected the medications to be given as directed on the PVC. Following the Attending Veterinarian's
instructions is important in ensuring animal health and well-being. Failure to follow the instructions may result in the
occurrence of parasite infestations/infections or other health problems. The facility needs to follow all instructions provided
by the Attending Veterinarian in the written PVC.
2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
During this inspection one hedgehog enclosure (plastic tub) was noted having fallen off its rack (a couple of feet off the
floor). The tub was on its side and the hedgehog had left the enclosure walking away from it. Shavings and a food bowl


fell out onto the floor. The hedgehog was quickly recaptured and placed back into the enclosure and appeared fine. The
employee stated that the enclosure must not have been placed back on the rack fully after it was cleaned this morning
and thus tipped over and off the rack when the hedgehog moved to the front of the enclosure. Handling of all animals
must be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, stress, physical harm or unnecessary
discomfort. Corrected during the inspection.
3.6(b)(3)

Primary enclosures.
The three Savannah cats housed in the back bathroom has one small litter box. The employee stated she cleaned the
litter box that morning but by lunch time it was already completely dirty with a large amount of stool and litter present. The
cats had scratched some of the litter and feces out of the box. No clean litter remained for the cats to use for defecation
and urination. The cats could be contaminated by excreta if they use the dirty litter box. All primary enclosures must
contain a litter box/receptacle that has sufficient clean litter to contain excreta and body wastes. Correct by 8/3/22.
3.9(b)

Feeding
The food bowl for three Savannah cats housed in the back bathroom is located right next to the one litter box. At the time
of the inspection this litter box was dirty with a large amount of excreta. The cats had scratched litter and excreta outside
the box. Placing the food bowl right next to the litter box means that litter and excreta scratched out of the uncovered box
by the cats may contaminate the food in the bowl. This may lead to spread of disease and may lead to the cats not
choosing to eat the food. Food receptacles for cats must be located so as to minimize contamination by excreta and
pests. Correct by 8/3/22.
3.26(b)

Facilities, indoor.


A strong ammonia odor was noted by the inspector upon entry into the facility. The odor stayed strong throughout the
inspection in all areas of the facility. The ammonia levels started to irritate the inspector's eyes by the end of the
inspection. Ammonia is a gas that causes irritation to the eyes, mucus membranes and the lungs of both humans and
animals. Insufficient cleaning of enclosures and poor ventilation combined can lead to buildup of the ammonia gas which
can negatively affect the health and comfort of the guinea pigs. Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated to
provide for the health and comfort of the animals at all times. Correct by 8/16/22.
3.28(a)(3)

Primary enclosures.
The enclosures housing the guinea pigs are in need of clean bedding. The bedding in the entirety of the enclosures was a
mixture of bedding pellets and excreta. The guinea pigs are not able to walk around in the enclosure without stepping on
excreta. The lack of clean bedding can lead to contamination of the animals, odors, and possible spread of disease.
Primary enclosures housing guinea pigs having a solid floor shall be provided with clean bedding material. Correct by
8/4/22.
3.30

Watering.
The open containers used as water bowls for the guinea pigs are contaminated with bedding and excreta. The containers
themselves are clean and the facility representative stated clean water was placed in the clean bowls this morning.
However by lunchtime, the guinea pigs had already had excreta collected on their feet while walking in their enclosure fall
into the water bowl (placed feet on rim to reach). The guinea pigs may choose not to drink the contaminated water or the
water may be a source for spread of disease. Open containers used for dispensing water to guinea pigs shall be placed in
or attached to the primary enclosure as to minimize contamination from excreta. Correct by 8/5/22.
3.53(a)(2)



Primary enclosures.
Two rabbit enclosures of wire are raised above a wooden enclosure with a solid floor. Bedding is present in the wooden
enclosure. Excreta from the rabbits in the two wire enclosures falls through the wire and onto the bedding. One rabbit is
currently being housed on the floor in the wooden enclosure. This rabbit was sitting underneath the wire enclosure.
Excreta falling from the rabbits above could land on top of the one rabbit housed below contaminating the rabbit's coat.
Primary enclosures housing rabbits shall be constructed and maintained so as to enable the rabbits to remain dry and
clean. Correct by 8/4/22.
3.81

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility currently houses four marmosets. The marmosets are provided with social housing and environmental
enrichment however there is no written plan for environment enhancement available for review. A blank form for the plan
was found in the USDA records. The employee was unaware of the existence of a plan. Non-human primates are social
animals that require social and environmental enrichment to promote their psychological well-being. This plan should be
in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and as directed by the attending veterinarian. The facility
shall develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement approved by their attending
veterinarian and adequate to promote the psychological well-being of the non-human primates. Correct by 9/2/22.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
Multiple animal enclosures are in need of cleaning.
*The litter box for the servals is in need of cleaning. The surface is covered with excreta.
*The floor of the serval enclosure has dried blood on it from a previous day's food.
*The resting surface shelves are dirty with brown dirt and grime.


*The plastic and wood nest/resting boxes for the kinkajous are dirty. The clear plastic box is speckled with dark brown
debris. The wooden boxes are streaked with a large amount of dark brown material.
*Three quarters of the hedgehog enclosures have dirty wet shavings and large amounts of stool in them. The hedgehogs
cannot avoid the wet dirty shavings. The facility representative stated she started cleaning the enclosure but ran out of
clean shavings. Another employee did bring some shavings later.
Enclosures need to be cleaned regularly. Excreta and debris need to be removed from enclosures as often as necessary
to prevent contamination of the animals, to minimize odors (such as ammonia) and to minimize disease hazards. Correct
by 8/4/22.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The back rooms (non-public areas) of the facility housing multiple species including the servals, kinkajous, and
hedgehogs are in need of general housekeeping and cleaning. An open trash bag with some of the trash fallen onto the
floor was sitting in front of the door to outside. Over an inch of sunlight was visible under this door. The doors sweep was
missing with dirt and debris on the floor just inside and outside the door. Pests can enter through the opening into the
facility. The entire floor was in need of sweeping and cleaning. Dirt, dirty bedding, clean bedding and food debris were all
noted on the floor in between and behind animal enclosures and around stored materials. Numerous items were stored on
the floor that were not necessary for daily husbandry. Regular cleaning/housekeeping is necessary to prevent odors,
eliminate breeding and living areas for pests and to reduce the potential for spread of disease. The premises shall be kept
clean in order to facilitate the required husbandry practices and to protect the health of the animals. Correct by 8/28/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with two employees.
