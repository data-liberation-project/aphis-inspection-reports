PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Space
A female Boston Terrier was housed in an enclosure that did not provide her with enough floor space. The
enclosure was measured at 30.5 inches x 20 inches which gives this dog 4.24 sq. ft. of available floor space. The
dog was measured to be approximately 22 inches in length. The minimum required floor space for this dog is
(22+6)(22+6)/144 = 5.44 sq. ft. Adequate floor space is required in order to ensure that the animals can make
normal postural adjustments and for their health and well-being. The licensee moved this dog to a larger enclosure
at the time of inspection. The licensee must ensure that each animal is provided with adequate floor space for the
health and well-being of the animals. Licensee must ensure that all animals are provided with adequate floor space
at all times.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Space plus additional space for puppies
There were two enclosures housing 2 Boston Terriers, both with puppies, that did not provided enough floor space.
One female Boston Terrier with 7 puppies was measured to be 22 inches in length. The enclosure was measured
at 33 inches x 30 inches which equals 6.86 sq. ft. of available floor space. The required minimum floor space for
the female Boston Terrier is 5.84 sq. ft. An additional minimum of 5% for each puppy is 0.27 sq. ft. The total
minimum required floor space for this dog and her 7 puppies is 5.84 + (0.27 x 7) = 7.73 sq. ft.
One female Boston Terrier with 6 puppies was measured to be 21 inches in length. The enclosure was measured
at 30 inches x 30 inches which equals 6.25 sq. ft. of available floor space. The required floor space for the female
Boston Terrier is 5.06 sq. ft. An additional minimum of 5% for each puppy is 0.25 sq. ft. The total minimum
required floor space for this dog and her 6 puppies is 5.04 + (.25 x 6) = 6.54 sq. ft.
The licensee must provide these dogs and their puppies with a larger enclosure. The licensee must ensure that
each animal is provided with adequate floor space for the health and well-being of the animals. Licensee must
ensure that all animals are provided with adequate floor space at all times and an additional 5% of the damsrequired floor space for each puppy.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A female Boston Terrier and her 3 puppies have become soiled from fecal material. The female Boston Terrier had
defecated inside of the whelping pan which contained the 3 young puppies. The puppies had fecal material on their
head, chest, abdomen and legs. The female Boston Terrier had fecal material on her head and legs. The fecal
material could cause harm or disease to the puppies and the adult dog. Fecal material must be removed at least
once daily or more often if necessary to prevent the dogs and puppies from becoming soiled and to reduce disease
hazards. The licensee must clean the fecal material from the enclosures, the female Boston Terrier and the
puppies and ensure that all fecal material is removed daily from the primary enclosure or more often if necessary to
prevent soiling of the animals contained in the enclosure and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
