Perimeter fence: The gate of the perimeter fence into the outdoor access area for the squirrel monkey does not
close completely, leaving the gate ajar and creating a gap. The gate must be rehung or replaced so it can close
securely to maintain the structural integrity of the perimeter fence to protect the monkey by restricting unauthorized
humans and animals from going through it and having contact with the monkey. Correct by June 3, 2015.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeeping for premises: Lemur and Macaques
***A food storage container, transport carrier, unplugged heater, and fire extinguishers in the off-exhibit storage area
of the indoor housing facilities are excessively dirty. There is a buildup of debris in the corners of the floor. Dried bird
feces are present on the heater. The fire extinguishers are not secured to a surface.
Premises associated with the animal areas should be kept free of an accumulation of debris and dirt to facilitate
general husbandry practices. The fire extinguishers should be stored in a manner that prevents potential injury to
the animal. All surfaces within the off-exhibit support areas must be kept clean on a regular basis and items should
be stored properly to ensure they are in working order when needed. Correct by May 30, 2015
***Also, a large hole is present in the wood threshold for entry into the lemur off-exhibit area.
Facilities should be kept in good repair to facilitate cleaning and eliminate areas for the pests to live and hide and to
eliminate the pooling of water which will attract pests and vermin. The threshold must be replaced to assist in proper
cleaning and to facilitate the pest control program. Correct by May 31, 2015

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
*** The board fencing for the petting zoo animals (5 goats, 6 pigs, 1 sheep, 1 alpaca) are excessively worn andportions of the fence are leaning. The wire fencing that is attached to the board fencing, is damaged in many areas
for the pigs and goat pens. The damage has resulted in the exposure of sharp wires that could potentially injure an
animal. Some sections of the fence are also leaning and wire panels detached from the wood fence in certain
areas.The primary enclosure fence for the petting zoo animals must be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to contain the animals and prevent injury. The board fencing and wire fencing must be repaired as needed or
replaced to protect the animals from injury, to ensure the containment of the petting zoo animals, and to prevent the
entry of unwanted animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter fence: The following areas of perimeter fence must be repaired or maintained.
1) A section of the wood perimeter fence along the front of the zoo is missing wood vertical boards and is not
secured to posts. This section of the fence must be repaired or replaced.
2) The wire perimeter fence around the puma enclosure has a broken fence post on the right side that has fallen
inward toward the enclosure dragging the wire fencing down. The wire fence is no longer at least 8 feet in height.
The fence post must be repaired or replaced to maintain the perimeter fence at least 8 feet in height.
3) The wood perimeter fence by the gate between the puma and tiger area has loose boards that must be
reattached to maintain the structural strength of the perimeter fence.
4) The wire perimeter fence by the serval enclosure has a gap between the wire mesh and the wire panel fencing.
The gap must be closed to prevent animals or people from going through the perimeter fence.
5) There is a large gap under the pedestrian gate of the perimeter fence into the back field area. The gap must be
closed to prevent animals from going under the fence.
6) A post for the perimeter fence is leaning away from the back of a building (near the capuchin enclosure) creating
a gap. The fence post must be secured and the gap eliminated to prevent animals or people from going through the
gap.
7) The back wire perimeter fence (opposite the creek) has areas that are overgrown with vines and vegetation. The
weight of the vegetation is bending the wire fencing down and making it difficult to see and evaluate the integrity of
the fence. The fence must be maintained at least 8 feet in height and be visible to evaluate its structural integrity.
8) The facility removed part of the back area of the wire perimeter fence to work on a vehicle path. The back wire
perimeter fence (opposite the creek) ends by the bobcat enclosure. There is no perimeter fence behind the artic foxenclosure. The perimeter fence must be rebuilt in this area to fully enclose all the animal enclosures.
The facility must establish and maintain a program to keep the perimeter fence in good repair to restrict animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals and so that the
perimeter fence can function as a secondary containment system for the animals housed within the facility. Correct
items 1-6 by June 3, 2015. Correct items 7 - 8 by June 10, 2015.

SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures
*** The floors in many of the off exhibit areas have surfaces that are in need of a general cleaning and removal of
debris and excreta. Specifically, the enclosure housing the coati has an excessive amount of dried feces on the top
of the carpeted platform. The older tiger enclosure has feces and debris that have built up in between the two board
fences at the front of the off-exhibit enclosure inside the shelter.
Feces and food waste present a disease hazard to the animals and attract pests. Surfaces must be free of a buildup
of excreta, food waste, and debris to minimize disease hazards, odors, and the attraction of pests. Feces and debris
must be removed from enclosures in a manner and at a frequency that prevents buildup to ensure an animal has a
clean area to rest and to facilitate effective pest control.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***The new guinea singing dog outdoor enclosure and the area in front of the enclosure has an overgrowth of a
weeds. A weed with very large leaves takes up ¾ of the enclosure space which allows for the potential harborage
of rodents and other unwanted pests. The high vegetation covering the ground in the outdoor enclosure prevents
seeing feces on the ground and makes cleaning the enclosure very difficult. Also, the singing dog does not appear
to want to come into the outdoor enclosure, choosing to stay off-exhibit and stand at the door leading to the outside
yard. The weeds must to be removed to allow the animal full access to the outdoor enclosure for its overall
well-being, to clean the enclosure, and to facilitate and effectively control potential pests. Additionally, a plan must
be developed to minimize or prevent the regrowth of the weeds. Correct by May 30, 2015
