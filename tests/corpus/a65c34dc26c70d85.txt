2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Pebbles" is an adult, male parti-colored Poodle with no identification number. When the enclosure was first
approached, inspectors noticed this dog was quietly curled up in the corner while the other dogs housed with him
barked and ran around. The dog was reluctant to have his mouth handled and initially pulled his head away. There
are open holes in the upper gums where the canine teeth used to be. In addition, the lower jaw bone felt "soft" and
could be moved side to side gently and slightly. Holes anywhere in the upper gums/mouth area have the potential to
lead directly to the nasal canal which could allow food and water to be inhaled. A soft, mobile lower jaw can indicate
bone loss from problems such as dental disease, metabolic diseases, or trauma and can be painful. Pain could be
the reason that this dog pulled his head away when initially examined. The animal listed above must be examined
by a licensed veterinarian by close of business on 9 December 2017 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is
obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
This correction date was given to the licensee verbally at the time of the inspection.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The adult, male parti-colored poodle named "Pebbles" did not have official identification. Pebbles was cited on this
report for a veterinary care problem. One female golden-doodle in the new round sheltered building also did not
have official identification. Correct official identification is essential to facilitate the inspection process and to verify
identity of animals of interest at subsequent inspections. The licensee must ensure that all live dogs held on the
premises shall be identified by approved methods including microchip, an official tag of the type described in Sec.
2.51 affixed to the animal's neck, or shall be identified by a distinctive and legible tattoo marking acceptable to and
approved by the Administrator. To be corrected by 13 December 2017.
2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are two dogs in the small dog sheltered building that are not accounted for on the APHIS 7005 form (Dogs on
Hand). Proper record keeping is essential for tracking the movement of animals and to facilitate the inspectionprocess. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the
required information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her
possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that
dealer or exhibitor.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Carpet squares in three enclosures in the small dog sheltered building (including whelping cages with puppies) were
worn and unraveling along the edges with long strings dangling from carpet edges. Strings hanging from rugs can
become wrapped around the legs of puppies causing pain and injury. This licensee must ensure that housing
facilities for dogs be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in good repair,
and they must protect the animals from injury, This includes safe enclosure spaces including carpet squares. This
was corrected at the time of inspection.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are four enclosures in the small dog sheltered building with chewed wood surfaces. The chewing has left
these areas of wood with a rough, unpainted surface. There is one enclosure in the same building with a chewed
plastic surface adjacent to the egress door with a deeply pitted and rough surface that is dirty at the time of the
inspection. The outdoor portions of two enclosures of the large dog sheltered building have areas of broken cement
with resulting cement chips. Surfaces that are not maintained so that they can be correctly cleaned and sanitized
can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces be maintained on a regular
basis. Surfaces of housing facilities (including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the
facility) that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected by 6
February 2018.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Yellow/brown liquid, leaves and debris had collected at the entrance of an outdoor dog run. Due to slant of the
concrete, the liquid could not drain properly. Accumulated water and waste can be a disease risk and interfere with
an animal’s ability to stay clean and dry. Licensee must provide for regular and frequent removal and disposal of
animal and food wastes, bedding, debris, garbage, water other fluids and wastes. To be corrected by 13 December
2017.
3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.The metal enclosure wall in the outdoor portion of one enclosure in the small dog sheltered building has a trimmed
area to allow for a ledge to pass through. One edge of this area has been torn and bent resulting in a sharp edge in
the enclosure. A portion of a chain link fence in the outdoor portion of one enclosure in the big dog sheltered
building is broken, with twisted metal portions of fence protruding into the enclosure at face level. Several metal
coated wire floor surfaces of enclosures in the small dog building were worn and broken with sharp points
protruding into the cages or accessible to the dogs' feet. The enclosure wall in one outdoor portion of the big dog
building has multiple areas of torn and jagged metal edges at the base. Sharp and pointed edges can cause injury
to animals. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures be constructed and maintained so that they have no
sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs. To be corrected by 6 January 2018.
3.10
WATERING.
A build-up of green material, in contact with the water, was adhered to the walls of three water receptacles in the
dog kennel area. Availability of potable water is necessary to ensure health and well-being of animals.
The licensee must ensure that water receptacles be kept clean and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this
subpart, and before being used to water a different dog or social grouping of dogs. To be corrected by 13 December
2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Katie Steneroden, VMO, and Margaret A
Shaver, VMO in attendance.
