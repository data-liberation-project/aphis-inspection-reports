2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
A review of acquisition records identified two Binturongs that were donated to the facility on February 15, 2020. On
the acquisition record, the address is incomplete, reflecting only a street name, city, and state but no street number.
Additionally, according to the facility representatives, the original owner of the Binturongs is not licensed or
registered with the USDA but no vehicle license number and State, nor the driver's license number and State, was
documented on the acquisition record.
Complete acquisition records are required for tracking animal ownership and for compliance with animal welfare
regulations. Acquisition records must contain the name and address from whom the animals are acquired from.
Acquisition records must also document either the USDA license or registration number if the animals were
obtained from a USDA licensee or registrant. If the animals were obtained by someone who is not licensed or
registered with the USDA, then the acquisition record must reflect:
1) The vehicle license number and State of the person the animals were acquired from and
2) The driver's license number and State of the person the animals were acquired from
Correct by including complete address and USDA license/registration information, or State, vehicle license number,
and driver's license number if not USDA licensed/registered, on all future acquisition records. Correct by August 15,
2020.
This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on August 12, 2020 and the exit briefing was held with
facility representatives on August 14, 2020.
