Veterinary Care - A female American Eskimo puppy, DOB 8-28-14, was observed with a possible injury to her tail.
Towards the end of the tail there is an area that is swollen and hairless, approximately 1 inch in length, with a small
wound on the top portion, followed by a constricted area, followed by another hairless area, approximately 1 inch in
length. At the end of the tail the hair is matted with dark material. The licensee was not aware of the puppy's
condition. This could be a sign of an injury. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian for an appropriate
diagnosis and treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive timely and adequate veterinary
care at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures
In the outside section of 3 of the primary enclosures, on the south side of the sheltered facility, and affecting 4 dogs,
there is an excessive accumulation of fecal material. The amount of fecal material in these enclosures made it
difficult for the dogs to avoid stepping in it. This amount of fecal material can soil the dogs creating a disease
hazard. The licensee must clean these enclosures and ensure that excreta and food wastes are removed from
primary enclosures at least once a day or more often if necessary to ensure for the health and well-being of the
animals.
