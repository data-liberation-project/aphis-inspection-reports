FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In several rabbit barns, uncovered light bulbs are hung over a portion of the rabbit enclosures, particularly over food
receptacles. In the event of breakage, rabbits could be injured by shattered glass. A system should be in place to
ensure light sources in animal facilities are maintained in a manner that doesn't pose a risk to the animals.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to
protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In all but one of the rabbit barns, the older style of rabbit enclosures are moderately covered in rust. The presence
of rust may prevent the required cleaning and sanitizing of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health
and well-being of the animals.
The facility is currently replacing rabbit primary enclosures, food receptacles, wood beams, and other structures. It
was noted that one barn was completed last year and in at least two barns a portion of the enclosures have been
replaced. The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they
are substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In approximately 10-20% of the older cages, the wire floor of the cage is damaged, with rusty sharp points
protruding into the primary enclosure and creating holes in the floor. In some cases, on one side of the enclosure,
the floor is no longer securely attached to the wall, resulting in a space where feet or legs can be trapped. When the
rabbit approached that side of the enclosure, the floor bowed underneath the weight of the rabbit, creating a larger
hole. Rabbits coming in contact with these areas can become injured. The floors of the primary enclosures shall beconstructed so as to protect the rabbits' feet and legs from injury.
The facility tried to temporarily patch some of the holes with strands of wire or patches. The patches can result in an
area where the feces accumulate and no longer drop through to the floor. The facility acquired new cages and is in
the process of replacing the older cages, with one barn completed and several other barns in progress.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Each barn has a variety of cage sizes housing rabbits of varying sizes. When asked, the facility representative
believes all enclosures were acquired after 1990. The following are examples of how many particular animals of
what weight were housed in an enclosure that did not meet our minimum required space.
In Barn 1,
In a row of enclosures providing 10 ft square of space, the following was observed:
2 enclosures with 9 rabbits, all less than 4.4 lbs
2 enclosures with 8 rabbits, all less than 4.4 lbs
Rabbits less than 4.4 lbs require 1.5 square feet per rabbit, so a maximum of 6 rabbits can be housed in 10 square
feet.
2 enclosures with 6 rabbits, all greater than 4.4 lbs, but less than 8.8 lbs
2 enclosures with 5 rabbits, all greater than 4.4 lbs, but less than 8.8 lbs
3 enclosures with 4 rabbits, all greater than 4.4 lbs, but less than 8.8 lbs
Rabbits weighing between 4.4-8.8 lbs require 3 square feet per rabbit, so a maximum of 3 rabbits can be housed in
10 square feet.
A 4 ft square enclosure with 3 rabbits, all less than 4.4 lbs.
Rabbits less than 4.4 lbs require 1.5 square feet per rabbit, so a maximum of 2 rabbits can be housed in 4 square
feet.
4 enclosures providing 3.75 square feet of space with a single rabbit that weighed over 8.8 lbs.
Rabbits weighing between 8.8-11.9 lbs require 4 square feet per rabbit, so in order to meet regulation, the maximum
weight of a rabbit housed 3.75 square feet is 8.8 lbs.
An enclosure providing 10 square feet of space had at least one rabbit that weighed 4.6 lbs with 5 other smallerrabbits.
Rabbits weighing between 4.4-8.8 lbs require 3 square feet per rabbit, while rabbits less than 4.4 lbs require 1.5
square feet per rabbit. The smaller rabbits require a total of 7.5 square feet, plus 3 feet for the larger rabbit equals
10.5 square feet required.
In Barn 2
An enclosure providing 10 square feet of space had at least one rabbit that weighed 4.6 lbs with 7 other smaller
rabbits.
Rabbits weighing between 4.4-8.8 lbs require 3 square feet per rabbit, while rabbits less than 4.4 lbs require 1.5
square feet per rabbit. The smaller rabbits require a total of 10.5 square feet, plus 3 feet for the larger rabbit equals
13.5 square feet required.
5 enclosures providing 5 square feet of space with a nursing mom weighing greater than 8.8 lbs and her litter.
A nursing mom with litter weighing greater than 8.8 lbs requires 6 square feet of space.
An enclosure providing 5 square feet of space had at least one rabbit that weighed 4.6 lbs with 3 other smaller
rabbits.
Rabbits weighing between 4.4-8.8 lbs require 3 square feet per rabbit, while rabbits less than 4.4 lbs require 1.5
square feet per rabbit. The smaller rabbits require a total of 4.5 square feet, plus 3 feet for the larger rabbit equals
7.5 square feet required.
In Barn 3
20 enclosures providing 5 square feet of space with a nursing mom weighing greater than 8.8 lbs and her litter.
A nursing mom with litter weighing greater than 8.8 lbs requires 6 square feet of space.
An enclosures providing 10 square feet of space with 8 rabbits, all less than 4.4 lbs
Rabbits less than 4.4 lbs require 1.5 square feet per rabbit, so a maximum of 6 rabbits can be housed in 10 square
feet.
In Barn 4
In a row of enclosures providing 5 ft square of space, the following was observed:
5 enclosures with 5 rabbits, all less than 4.4 lbs
Rabbits less than 4.4 lbs require 1.5 square feet per rabbit, so a maximum of 3 rabbits can be housed in 5 square
feet.
3 enclosures with 4 rabbits, all greater than 4.4 lbs, but less than 8.8 lbs
6 enclosures with 3 rabbits, all greater than 4.4 lbs, but less than 8.8 lbs
6 enclosures with 2 rabbits, all greater than 4.4 lbs, but less than 8.8 lbs
Rabbits weighing between 4.4-8.8 lbs require 3 square feet per rabbit, so a maximum of 1 rabbit can be housed in 5square feet.
8 enclosures with a nursing mom weighing greater than 8.8 lbs and her litter.
A nursing mom with litter weighing greater than 8.8 lbs requires 6 square feet of space.
In Barn 10
10 enclosures providing 5 square feet of space with a nursing mom weighing greater than 8.8 lbs and her litter.
A nursing mom with litter weighing greater than 8.8 lbs requires 6 square feet of space.
In a row of enclosures providing 6.75 ft square of space, the following was observed:
At least one enclosure with 7 rabbits, all less than 4.4 lbs
At least one enclosure with 6 rabbits, all less than 4.4 lbs
At least one enclosure with 5 rabbits, all less than 4.4 lbs
Rabbits less than 4.4 lbs require 1.5 square feet per rabbit, so a maximum of 4 rabbits can be housed in 6.75
square feet.
In a row of enclosures providing 5 ft square of space, the following was observed:
At least one enclosure with 4 rabbits, all greater than 4.4 lbs, but less than 8.8 lbs
3 enclosures with 3 rabbits, all greater than 4.4 lbs, but less than 8.8 lbs
Rabbits weighing between 4.4-8.8 lbs require 3 square feet per rabbit, so a maximum of 1 rabbit can be housed in 5
square feet.
Adequate floor space in primary enclosures is essential in order to safeguard the health and well-being of the
rabbits. Overcrowding can result in stress, disease, and injury. Primary enclosures should be measured and the
rabbits weighed so that rabbits can be redistributed into housing where they have adequate floor space and suitable
companions.

SANITATION.
In one of the rabbit barns, there was a moderate amount of flies present. Although there is some pest control
present,
additional measures should be taken to minimize the fly populations in these areas. The presence of insects,
including flying pests, can injure and increase disease hazards in animal areas.
An effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established
and maintained.
