2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee does not have a written program of veterinary care and although he has veterinarians who can provide
services for the animals when contacted they do not make regularly scheduled visits to the facility. Each exhibitor
shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements to ensure that adequate veterinary can be
provided to the animals on the premises. Formal arrangements with a part time or consulting veterinarian must
include a written program of veterinary care for all species that reflects veterinary, husbandry, handling and dietary
practices at the facility and regularly scheduled visits by the veterinarian often enough to provide appropriate
oversight of the care and use of the animals.
2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*A mature female waterbuck listed on the prior inspection was found deceased before the attending veterinarian
was able to assess the animal. The licensee stated that it was found in the mud Saturday.
*A mature beefalo cow listed on the prior inspection was found deceased without given adequate veterinary care.
Without appropriate methods to diagnose and treat injuries and illness, animal conditions may worsen or in this
case, the animals condition may become fatal. Animals must have access to adequate veterinary care as
prescribed in the formal arrangements.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following animals identified during this inspection were exhibiting symptoms indicative of compromised health
and must be examined by a veterinarian, a diagnosis obtained and appropriate treatment rendered:
*A mature aoudad ram continues to be unable to use either front foot/leg in a normal manner when walking and the
front hooves appear to be overgrown. The animal was seen ambulating on the knees and when attempting to
weight bear on the front feet an obviously abnormal, exaggerated gait and weight shifting was apparent. The
attending veterinarian did not diagnose the animal during a recent visit. Abnormal postures and gaits can indicate aserious, painful problem with the feet.
*A mature Watusi bull, “Steve” exhibits a continuous dramatic head tilt or torticollis to the left side. The licensee
stated the condition has been present for several years. The attending veterinarian was unable to make a diagnosis
during a recent visit. Steve also has a copious mucous discharge dripping from the left nostril. Head tilt and
torticollis can be indicative of infectious or non-infectious disease processes or trauma and may cause discomfort to
the animal.
*A mature female dromedary camel “Cleo” who is possibly older than 20 years, was dorsally recumbent in an open
pasture. Facility staff were requested to encourage Cleo to stand and were successful. However, the camel was
slow to rise, appeared stiff, inflexible and when the animal attempted to walk it seemed to do so with difficulty. A
round growth, approximately the size of a baseball, was observed at the base of her tail.
Compromised ability to stand or walk can indicate pain, weakness or discomfort.
This was a focused inspection to address veterinary care noncompliances and noncompliances with expired
correction dates listed in 8/3/2017 inspection. inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
