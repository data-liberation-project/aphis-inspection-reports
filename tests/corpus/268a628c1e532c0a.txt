ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was an approximately 7 1/2 year old male Yorkshire Terrier (#108*379*351), "Dexter", that had its tongue
hanging out and an excessive amount of saliva in the fur surrounding the mouth. He also appeared to have an
abnormal looking jaw. Upon closer observation, most of the dog's lower jaw was easily moveable and only a
portion, mainly the rear portion of the jaw, appeared to have a firm bone-like structure to it. Also, most of the teeth
were missing. There was an upper right canine tooth present which was abnormal in appearance. The tooth was
covered in a heavy amount of grey to black to brown material. The gums were significantly receded over this tooth
and much of its root was exposed. A brown material, which was rough and cobblestone in appearance, covered the
root portion of the tooth. According to a facility representative, she had noticed that the dog seemed to have an
issue with eating its dry kibble so she had started offering the dog some canned food; however, a veterinarian had
not been contacted regarding the dog's condition. The abnormal build-up of material on the tooth can cause
damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. The abnormal jawbone and missing teeth could be the result of a
dental condition and/or a variety of other veterinary medical conditions. These conditions could negatively impact
the dog's ability to eat normally and overall well-being. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed
veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed
and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The
licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary
care for the animals at the facility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at
all times. To be corrected by: October 8, 2015.
The inspection and a preliminary exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility representative. The
exit interview was completed with a facility representative.
