ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* No expiration date was recorded on one bottle containing Cephalexin pills. This medication was intermingled
with other products that are currently being used at the facility and is therefore ready for use. This medication was
obtained from the attending veterinarian. Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information to
ensure that the contents of the container can be known with certainty. The effectiveness and expected results could
be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated if the expiration date is unknown. The usage of any
medication with an unknown expiration date on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary
practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in
the facility have a current expiration date recorded. Correct by 5/25/15.
*****************************************************
* The following medication used to treat the dogs at the facility was past the labeled expiration date. The
recorded expiration date on one bottle containing Metronidazole 250 mg pills was 11/2013. This medication was
intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and is therefore ready for use. The
usage of expired drugs on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not
constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired
drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure
that all medications used on the dogs have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Correct by 5/25/15.

and sanitized. Excessive rust affects the structural integrity of all metal surfaces. The licensee must ensure that
this and all other surfaces are free of rust and of good structural strength. Correct by 6/11/15.* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 5/11/15 were conducted with the licensee.
