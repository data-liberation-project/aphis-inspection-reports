****In the whelping building, there was an adult white female Boxer (#486B6D67407) with two areas of hair loss. An
approximately 1 inch diameter region of hair loss was noticed on the bridge of the dog’s nose. Within the area of
hair loss and along the margins of the hair loss, multiple pinpoint regions of the skin appeared orange to brown to
black and crusty to scab-like. Another area of hair loss, approximately ½ inch diameter, was noted on the dog’s
right side over its chest. According to the licensee, she was aware of the lesion on the dog’s nose but unaware of
the hair loss on the dog’s side. There was no documentation at the facility about the dog’s condition and she was
not currently giving the dog any treatment.
****In the outdoor facility, an adult female German Shepherd Dog (#0A02272611), housed with two other German
Shepherd Dogs, had her left ear held slightly down and her head slightly favored to the left. On closer observation,
the left ear had some build-up of dark brown to black wax-like material on the inside of the ear. According to the
licensee, she had not noticed the dog’s condition. This dog’s condition could be due to an ear infection or other
veterinary medical condition which could be uncomfortable and could lead to additional health problems for the dog.
****In the outdoor facility, an adult male Shiba Inu (#077843024), which was housed with another adult dog, had
lesions on his right front leg and on the tip of his nose. The tip of the nose appeared red, raw and sore-like in an
approximately 1 cm area above the right nostril. The margins of the lesion were white next to the normal looking
black tissue. The tissue appeared slightly sunken, like a small divot, in the reddened and affected area on the
nose. The dog also had patchy regions of hair loss mostly along the inside of the front right leg. There were a
variety of sizes and shapes of reddened skin lesions along most of the length of the inside of the leg in the areas of
hair loss. Some of the fur near the hair loss appeared darker than surrounding fur. The licensee had not noticed
this dog’s condition. This dog’s lesions could be due to injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition which
could be painful.

****The licensee must have the male Shar Pei (#094335853), female German Shepherd Dog (#0A02272611), male
Shiba Inu (#077843024) and Basset Hound “Reba” (#2840001201) examined by a licensed veterinarian. The
licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding the conditions of the female Boxer (#486B6D67407),
female Jack Russell Terrier (#058786768), female French Bulldog, “Izzy” (#0A02376528), the female Basset Hound
“Cee Cee”, the thin black and tan male German Shepherd Dog (GSD) and the thin silver and tan female GSD,
female Shiba Inu (#900032002245217) and male Boxer “White Lightning” (#045044059). These veterinary
examinations and/or consultations are in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and that appropriate
treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and provide it to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.
****There were some medications and vaccines at the facility which were past their labeled expiration date. There
were two open boxes of vaccines for dogs with expiration dates labeled on the bottles as 13 May 16, 12 Feb 16 and
30 Jun 16. The vaccinations were intermingled with other products currently being used at the facility and are
therefore ready for use. Also, a bottle of “Vetericyn” spray currently being used by the licensee, expired 02-2015.
This product was stored outside in the sun. The storage directions on the bottle state the product is to be stored at
room temperature away from direct sunlight. According to the licensee, she was using the product on the some of
the dogs. Expired medications or vaccines can lose their effectiveness and their ability to prevent or control disease
and/or pain. The licensee must ensure all medications and vaccines are stored according to label directions and
are within their expiration dates at all times.

****A white male Boxer, “White Lightning” (#045044059), had an open skin lesion on the outside left ear flap near
the top of the head. The skin lesion was approximately 1 inch in length and appeared red and inflamed. It was
moist looking with a yellow to white discharge. The margins of the wound appeared to have a build-up of thick
crusty to mucous-like black material which extended into the adjacent fur. According to the licensee, she was not
aware of this dog’s sore-like lesion. This dog’s condition could be due to an injury, infection or other veterinary
medical condition which could be painful and/or lead to other health problems.
****A female Basset Hound, “Reba” (#28400012101), had a heavy amount of a thick creamy green discharge in
both eyes. The surface of the eye appeared dull. The discharge appeared to be accumulating in the corners and
along the bottoms of each eye. This dog was also included on the report for the March 16, 2016 inspection for greeneye discharge. There was written documentation dated 3/19/16 at the facility with a diagnosis of “dry eye”. The
licensee was instructed to give “’Optimmune’ drops in eye twice a day for one week, then once a day till gone – call
office”. According to the treatment record at the facility, the licensee started giving the treatment on 3-19-16 and
ended on 4-24-16. There was no additional documentation at the facility regarding this dog’s condition. According
to the licensee and a facility representative, since the medication ran out they have been using eye wash which they
do about once a day. They said that the eye wash was done with water on a towel and the dog’s eyes were last
washed approximately 4 hours prior to inspection of the dog. There is no written documentation at the facility that
the dog has been addressed by a veterinarian since April 2016 for its condition nor is there any written
documentation of treatment for the dog’s eyes after April 2016. The licensee has not had the dog seen by a
veterinarian in approximately the last three months. This dog’s current condition of continuing green eye discharge
could be due to inadequate treatment or other veterinary medical condition including an eye infection. Some
conditions can be painful and may lead to blindness. It is important to follow-up with a veterinarian when an animal
does not appear to be improving and the symptoms continue or worsen.

****A female Shiba Inu (#900032002245217), which was housed with another adult dog, was observed consistently
circling within her outdoor enclosure. There was a distinct circular path worn into the gravel that spanned between
the sides of each panel of the enclosure. She was repeatedly running in the path of the circle. She continued this
behavior for at least 1.5 minutes before she stopped when she had been called to come to the fence. She then
immediately continued to go back to circling in the worn path. This repetitive pattern of circling was consistent for
the time we were in front of or within sight of the enclosure (at least 10 minutes). She would break the circling cycle,
not always immediately but eventually, when called toward the fence. She also had an area of hair loss on the left
side of her hip near the base of her tail. The central portion of the hair loss contained tissue that appeared red and
inflamed. This reddened tissue, which was approximately ½ inch long, was immediately surrounded by white tissue
which was immediately surrounded by black tissue. The black tissue was adjacent to an area of short fur.
According to the licensee, she had taken the dog to a veterinarian for the sore-like lesion. She said it was a “hot
spot” and she was still treating it with Vetricyn. The circling could indicate a behavioral problem or an underlying
veterinary medical condition. There was no documentation indicating the animal had been examined and/or
assessed by a veterinarian for either condition. The licensee must ensure that all animals with veterinary medical
problems, including abnormal behaviors, are addressed with the veterinarian to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is
achieved and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.2.40(b)(2)

****In the outdoor portion of the facility, there were three additional adult dogs observed with some eye discharge.
****A male Shar Pei (#094335853) had a heavy amount of thick green mucous-like discharge collecting mostly in
the fur under both eyes. The fur surrounding both eyes appeared moist with varying amounts of discharge present
in the fur. The surface of the eye was difficult to visualize as the dog pulled away and resisted for his eyes to be
more closely observed.

****A female Jack Russell Terrier, (#058786768), was observed occasionally squinting its left eye. This eye had
some green mucous-like discharge surrounding the entire margins of the left eye. The discharge also appeared as
green crusty to mucous-like material in some of the fur adjacent to the eyelids.
-A female French Bulldog, “Izzy” (#0A02376528), had some green to light yellow discharge surrounding most of the
left eye and a smaller amount at the bottom of the right eye. Also, a small amount of thick white mucous-like
discharge had collected along the bottom inside margin of the left eyelid. Green crusty to mucous-like material was
observed in the fur mostly around the dog’s left eye but was also present in the dog’s fur under the right eye.
According to the licensee, the dog had recently been in a fight with a male French Bulldog “Toby” (#48572B7F76)
with which she had previously shared an enclosure with but she was now located adjacent to him. The licensee
had separated the dogs and she said she was treating each of them for skin wounds resulting from the fight around
the muzzle. However, she said she was unaware of the eye discharge and no treatment had been given for the
eyes.
According to the licensee, she was not aware of any of these dogs’ eye conditions. There was no written
documentation at the facility for a protocol to treat these dogs’ conditions nor was there any documentation of any
treatments administered for any of the conditions. Eye discharge can be due to infections and/or other veterinary
medical conditions which can be uncomfortable and may lead to more serious health problems.
****Three dogs in the outdoor facility were observed to be very thin. This included a female Basset Hound “Cee
Cee”, a black and tan male German Shepherd Dog (GSD), and a silver and tan female GSD. These dogs each
displayed, at some point, fearful-like behavior postures and/or actions, such as having tails tucked between the
legs, body lowered and/or ears back. Repeated attempts for closer observation were not done. All of these dogs
had ribs that were easily visible and obvious waists. The tops of the lumbar vertebrae were visible and the pelvic
bones were becoming prominent for the male GSD and the female Basset Hound. The thin male and female GSDwere housed in an enclosure together with an additional female GSD. According to the licensee, the male GSD had
recently been stung by bees and she felt the dog had lost weight since this had happened. When asked what she
was doing for the dog’s condition, the licensee replied that she was giving these GSDs a higher protein and higher
fat dog food, which was a dry dog food for adults, and nothing else. According to the licensee, she was giving the
female Basset Hound, “Cee Cee”, a dewormer and some canned adult dog food in addition to the dry dog food.
There was no documentation at the facility regarding the body condition of these dogs including no records of
treatments given for their condition nor any veterinary approved protocol to address or treat thin dogs. Poor body
condition in dogs can be due to inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other underlying medical problems.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
**** There were no forms of identification nor records of inventory present on "unweaned" puppies born at the
facility. No inventory information was attached to five enclosures containing 23 "unweaned" puppies. Identification
is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping
requirements. The licensee must ensure that all dogs less than 16 weeks of age are identified by an official tag as
described in Sec. 2.51, a legible tattoo approved by the Administrator, a microchip, or a cage card (if maintained as
a litter with their dam and housed within the same primary enclosure). If no offspring have been recorded on USDA
official 7005 forms, then the following information must be recorded and attached to the enclosure: the dealer's
USDA number, the unique number identifying each puppy, the date of birth of the litter, the dam's ID number, a
description of each puppy (breed, sex, color and any distinctive markings) and date of disposition. The inventory
information records must be maintained with all corresponding 7006's for one year. If the licensee chooses to
identify the "unweaned" puppies with official USDA identification (collar, tattoo or microchip), then no inventory
information is required on the enclosure. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure that every puppy's
identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace all puppies. The licensee must maintain
complete and accurate records of all puppies at all times at their facility.

information. The APHIS Form 7005 was missing required acquisition information for the majority of these dogs.
The APHIS Form 7005 also did not list three of the dogs' microchip numbers, or any other official identifying
number. Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known
with certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. The licensee must maintain records which fully andcorrectly disclose all of the information required on an APHIS Form 7005.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces
****Inside of the sheltered whelping building there were three enclosures housing a total of one dog and 14 puppies.
There was an accumulation of blackish brown grime, and feces on the short solid side panels. The wire panels had
an accumulation of hair, cobwebs and dust on the lower sides. The accumulation of dirt and grime can cause
diseases and attract pests. Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly or often enough, increase the risk
of disease hazards for the dogs and puppies. The licensee must ensure all surfaces in contact with the dogs and
puppies are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks. The licensee must ensure all other
surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry
standards.
****The outdoor enclosures throughout the facility contained greater than a day's worth of fecal material. In most of
the enclosures, it appeared the amount of fecal material present made it difficult for the animals to avoid walking in
it. Inside of the dogs’ enclosure, flies were concentrated around the feces and food waste. According to the
licensee, the outdoor enclosures have the feces picked up on Wednesday and Sunday. Hard surfaces with which
the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11 (b) of this subpart
to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. The licensee must remove the accumulated fecal
material from these enclosures and ensure that all excreta is removed daily from primary enclosures to prevent
soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
****Most of the outdoor shelter units for the ground enclosures had a buildup of dirt and grime on the inside and/or
outside surfaces with which the dog's have contact. Also, many of these shelter units had a large accumulation of
dirt and gravel on the inside bottom portion of the shelter units; most of the flooring in these shelter units was not
visible due to the amount of gravel in them. The accumulation of gravel, dirt and grime within and/or on the shelter
units increases the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must clean these shelter units and ensure all hard
surfaces with which the dogs come in contact are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b)
of this subpart to reduce disease hazards. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized
when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
3.1(f)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
General requirements
****In multiple outdoor enclosures, housing adult dogs, there are standing puddles of water and areas near the
feeders that are wet. Licensee stated water bowls are dumped in this area. Large numbers of flies and a sour odor,
were present in these enclosures. Housing facilities must be equipped with disposal facilities and drainage systems
that are constructed and operated so that animal waste and water are rapidly eliminated and animals stay dry.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
General requirements
****One adult German Shepherd Dog has an igloo-style shelter that is too small. The dog was longer and taller than
the provided shelter. Shelters which do not allow dogs to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner can be
uncomfortable for the dogs and could even cause them orthopedic problems. The licensee must ensure that the
each dog has access to a shelter which is large enough to allow the dog to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner,
and to turn about freely.
3.6(a)(2)(i) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General requirements
****In two outdoor enclosures, containing a total of five dogs, exposed nail points were observed. One shelter had
two nail points protruding into the tunnel that gives access to the shelter. Another enclosure had a board buried in
the gravel with an exposed nail point on the end. These sharp nail points were all at the level of the dogs where they
could easily come in contact with the sharp points. The sharp point of the nail could potentially injure the dog
causing pain or discomfort. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so
that there are no sharp points or edges that could injure the dog at all times
3.6(a)(2)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
StructureCritical****According to the licensee, a black and white female Cocker Spaniel climbed out of the outdoor portion of
her enclosure from the whelping facility about a week ago. The licensee stated the dog had escaped from her
enclosure three times. Upon escaping the third time, the dog made it out onto the road and was hit and killed by a
passing car. The wire wall panels that separated the raised enclosures were at least 5 feet in height. The outdoor
portion of the enclosures for the whelping building are uncovered. Enclosure fencing that allows any dog to scale it
to the top does not contain the dog securely. The potential for injury exists if the dog jumps from the top of
enclosure fencing. Licensee must insure that all enclosures are maintain, so as to contain the dogs at all times.

FEEDING.
****Food bowls and self-feeders throughout the facility had an accumulation of grime and dirt. The self-feeders had
a metal piece inside caked with food and rusty areas. The licensee stated it had been several weeks since they had
been cleaned and sanitized. Water and food receptacles, which are not properly cleaned and sanitized, can harbor
disease-causing organisms and could decrease the dogs' acceptability of the food and water. The licensee must
ensure that all water and food receptacles are kept clean and are sanitized at least once every two weeks or more
often if necessary in order to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease
hazards.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control
****Throughout the outdoor facility, excessive flies were noticed around the animals and on the ground near animal,
food and water waste located inside the dogs’ enclosures. These flies were concentrated around feces in the
enclosures as well as around food on the ground that had fallen to the ground or had been cleaned out of feeders.
Many damp areas in the pens also had many flies around those spots in the enclosures. Pests, such as flies,
increase the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must develop a program of safe and effective pest control to
reduce or eliminate the population of flies in this area.
This report is the second portion of a full inspection conducted on August 10, 2016 with the licensee by Erika
Leisner VMO, Bill Heine ACI and a representative of Missouri Department of Agriculture. A thorough and complete exit interview was conducted with licensee on the phone on August 10, 2016 and in
person on August 11, 2016
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 10, 2016
