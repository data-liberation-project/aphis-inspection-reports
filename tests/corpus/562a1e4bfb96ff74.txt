ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male white Standard Poodle, microchip # 0402123964, was seen lying in the back of his enclosure with a black
substance around his left ear and on the left side of his face. Closer inspection revealed that the hair around the
ear was wet and caked with a thick black substance, and the ear was red and inflamed. Licensee stated the dog
had been evaluated for this condition by a veterinarian in February 2014 and was told to switch the dog to a pork
based diet. Licensee has been treating the ear with vinegar and peroxide. Poor ear health can cause pain and
discomfort to the dog. The above listed dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by the end of business on
November 18, 2014 for proper diagnosis and treatment. Diagnosis and treatment must be documented and made
available to inspectors upon request.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Four shelters provided for eight adult dogs in the "(cid:28)big dog run" area(cid:29) do not provide a wind/rain break at the
entrance of the shelters. The temperature at the time of inspection ranged from 10 degrees to 14 degrees. The
temperatures over the weekend dropped below zero and wind advisories were in effect. Missing wind/rain breaks
make it difficult for the dogs to get out of the weather and maintain their body temperatures in the cold weather. Wind/rain breaks of some kind need to be provided for all shelters.
