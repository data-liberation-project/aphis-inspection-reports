protruding ends may cause injury or entrapment of the animals.

edges in an area of potential contact with the animals. At time of inspection, there was one adult Kangaroo being
housed in this enclosure. Sharp, points or edges could potentially cause injury to the animals.

plastic crate. The location of the cord was within potential reach of the animals and poses the risk of serious injury
from electrical hazards.

protect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and
maintenance must be in place.
