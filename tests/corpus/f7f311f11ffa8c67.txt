FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure containing 15 adolescent rabbits is constructed of wood and wire mesh. The bottom of the wire mesh
on the far side (right side) of the enclosure was not secured. The wire mesh moves back and forth, leaving a gap
large enough for a rabbit to get a leg or foot caught in-between the wood and the wire mesh. This enclosure does
not protect these animals from injury.
There were several wooden enclosures, raised platform fixtures and wood framing supports that were found to be in
disrepair. There were several walls, fixtures and support structures that are saturated in urine and feces with
various degrees of deterioration of the wood. These areas which have not been properly maintained cannot be
properly sanitized and the deteriorated wood creates an optimal area for bacterial and fungal growth placing
animals at an increased risk of disease.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures, fixtures and support structures in all areas of the facility are made of a
suitable material and are kept in good repair.
Correct By: The enclosure with the 15 adolescent rabbits must be corrected by 4/06/2015.
The wooden enclosures, raised platform fixtures and wood framing support structures need to be correct by
4/20/2015.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
This is an outside facility with a strong odor due to the excessive amount of feces and urine thought the entire
facility. Every solid surface had various degrees of food waste, animal waste, debris and other organic material
buildup. A combination of improper waste disposal and inadequate cleaning and sanitization is directly contributing
to the odor and disease hazards within the facility. The Licensee must ensure that there are proper procedures in
place for the removal and disposal of animal waste, food waste, dirty bedding and debris. Correct by ensuring that
these waste materials (food, excreta, and dirty bedding) are disposed as often enough and in a manner suitable toprevent odors, vermin infestation, and disease hazards.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Inspectors arrived at the facility about 9:15Am. At that time, the front gate to the facility was open, not secured and
no one was home or at the facility. At that time, the Licensee told inspectors that she would not be home for
inspection until about 12PM. Although she was able to return home before 12PM, the gate was left open and
unsecured the entire time she was gone from the facility and would have remained open until at least 12PM, when
she was expecting to be home. Once the inspectors were able to enter the facility and start the inspection, there
were two other gates that were noticed to be open and not secured.
In addition, there is a section of fencing, about three feet in diameter, by the back right corner of the facility with a
gap at the bottom of the fencing approximately ½-1 feet from the ground. This gap is large enough for a rabbit to
escape from the facility or allow small predators to enter the facility. Inspectors identified at least one rabbit belongs
to the facility and was not properly enclosed was observed outside the facility(cid:25)s fence and not contained in any way.
This rabbit was identified by the licensee as (cid:28)Silverado(cid:29) and inspectors were told that she was heavily pregnant.
She was able to get out of her enclosure and was able to make it under the secondary fencing around the facility.
Rabbits housed outdoors are vulnerable to attacks by predators therefore outdoor housing facilities for rabbits are
required to be fenced or otherwise enclosed to prevent the entrance of predators. Failure to maintain this fencing in
a manner that excludes predators can lead to severe injury and / or the death of animals. Correct by ensuring that
rabbit enclosures are fenced or otherwise enclosed to minimize escape or the entrance of predators and that gates
to such fencing are kept closed so that the fencing remains functional.

3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are several enclosures that do not provide the animals a flat or level surface for the rabbits to rest. The floors
of the enclosures are constructed of wire mesh with no additional source of support for the larger rabbits, which
significantly sags and is not stable under the weight of the animal. The sloping of the floor created by the excessive
sagging is steep enough that it prevents the rabbits from moving freely about their enclosure or from restingcomfortably in most places. Failure to provide suitable flooring may lead to injury of these animals. Correct by
ensuring that all enclosures are maintained in good repair and have a secure level surface at the bottom of the
animal(cid:25)s enclosure.
At the time of inspection, there were three rabbits being housed inside of the Licensee(cid:25)s house. These animals
were located on top of the sink/counter area of the laundry room of the house. The top of the counter/sink area was
approximately 3-4 feet off of the floor and had no sides or other barriers to prevent the rabbits from falling or
jumping down off the sink/counter. When asked about this arrangement, the Licensee stated that these animals
were in need of treatment or grooming. One rabbit had been housed in this area for several weeks. However; the
licensee stated that the other two animals needed to be groomed and had been housed in this area since at least
the day prior to the inspection and overnight. All primary enclosures are required to be constructed in a manner that
prevents escapes and protects animals from injury. The lack of any walls or barriers to prevent these animals from
falling is not adequate containment as falls from this height may result in injury to these animals. . Correct by
ensuring that all primary enclosures are constructed in a manner that will contain the animals securely and also
prevent potential injury.
Correct By: All animals housed in the launder room moved to proper enclosure immediately. The flooring of
enclosures must be corrected by 4/13/2015
3.56(a)(3) REPEAT
SANITATION.
In the only shelter structure with plastic side panels, all of the hay/straw bedding, urine and waste of the bottom
enclosures are not adequately contained in bins or pans. This area has several stacked cages and currently
manure and urine fall from the top cages through the lower cages and onto the ground. During inspection,
Inspectors observed one rabbit in a top enclosure urinate directly onto a rabbit located in a bottom enclosure in this
area. The pan collecting waste from the top enclosure was not large enough to cover the entire floor space of the
top enclosure allowing feces and urine to fall directly into the wire cages below. There are several other enclosures
with a similar arrangement that were not located within the shelter structure. These areas had some form of waste
collection bins, pans or worm bin. However; several of the bins/pans were not large enough to cover the entire floor
space of the enclosures and the feces and urine would fall directly onto the ground in several areas. When wire
cage floors is used, bins, pans, worm bins or troughs must be used to collect waste and must be large enough to
cover all areas where waste and bedding may collect outside of the enclosure. In addition, the bins or pan must be
removed weekly as a minimum requirement and kept in a sanitary condition. Discarding bedding and excreta
appropriately will minimize odors and flies, which can contribute to disease hazards and create an unhealthy living
environment for the rabbits.

SANITATION.
This facility (the grounds and garage/storage area) has an excessive amount of cluttered materials that are not
currently being used. Unused wooden or wire enclosures, wood pieces, plastic pieces, wire mesh, boxes, bins, etc.
are present laying in various locations within the fenced area of the facility as well as the storage area in the garage.
There is no organization to any of these materials and the majority are being kept in unsanitary conditions,
contributing to disease hazards within the facility. Excessive clutter creates an ideal breeding ground for
mammalian pests and creates numerous hiding areas that may also conceal predators. Correct by ensuring that all
unwanted items are properly discarded and removed from the property. Additionally, useful items must be properly
cleaned, organized, and stored so that all areas of the premise including the garage / storage areas are kept clean,
in good repair, and free of the accumulation of trash in order to facilitate proper husbandry practices.

3.56(d)
SANITATION.
In the only shelter structure with the plastic side panels, there is an excessive amount of flies and nats. When the
licensee was asked about her pest control program, she stated that she normally uses fly strips within this structure,
however, she believed that it had been cold out and the strips were not needed. There were no means of pest
control being used at the facility during this inspection. The widows for this area did not have screens to exclude
flies, there were no fly strips present in this area, there were no fly traps present on the property or in this area. The
degree of the pest problem is likely contributed to by the lack of proper cleaning and sanitization, waste disposal,
and excessive clutter also present on the property as these problems may attract pests, flies and other unwanted
vermin. These pests and insects contribute to disease hazards to the animals at this facility. The Licensee must
establish and maintain an effective pest control program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, avian, and
mammalian pests. Correct by implementing strategies for the control of these pests and ensuring that there are
mechanisms in place to monitor for and respond to future pest problems.

3.61(a)(2)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE RABBITS.
The facility uses blue Rubbermaid-type plastic totes with removal tops to transport rabbits to parties. Many of these
containers have cracks on the lids or on the sides. The Licensee previously indicated that she would write (cid:28)do not
use(cid:29) on the bins once cracked and remove them from use for transportation, but only one tote had this notation.
These totes, as well as the other cracked totes, were present in the same area as totes currently in-use, indicating
that they were available for use as well. Using totes that are cracked and damaged can cause injury to the rabbits
being transported and can also make them likely to become more severely damaged. These broken totes lack the
structural strength sufficient to withstand the normal rigors of transportation and may result in injury to the animals
or escape. Several cracks are broken in such a way that the cracked surface creates a sharp edge which protrudes
into the enclosure and has the potential to cause injury. Correct by repairing or replacing damaged transport
enclosures. Those transport enclosures that cannot be repaired, must be properly disposed of to prevent accidental
use and avoid accumulation of trash.

3.61(a)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE RABBITS.
This facility is currently using blue Rubbermaid-type totes with removable tops on a regular basis to transport rabbits
to parties. The ventilation openings for the rabbits while in these totes are small holes that have been placed in the
top of the tote lids. Inadequate ventilation can restrict necessary airflow to the animals and result in overheating or
otherwise compromise health during transportation.
All licensees are required to ensure that transport enclosures for rabbits have ventilation openings located on two
opposite walls of the primary enclosure and that the ventilation openings on each wall are at least 16 percent of the
total surface area. Alternately, transport enclosures for rabbits may have ventilation openings located on all four
walls of the primary enclosure provided that those openings are at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each
wall.
As they are currently constructed the Rubbermaid-type totes do not provide adequate ventilation as required.
Correct by ensuring that all transport enclosure used in the future are constructed in a manner that adequate
ventilation is provided to all animals and that all other requirements for enclosure construction are met.
Correct By: Prior to any future transport of rabbits in these enclosures and not later than 4/13/2015
