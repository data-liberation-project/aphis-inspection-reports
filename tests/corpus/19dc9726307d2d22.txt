2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Yorkshire terrier (cid:28)Cinnamon(cid:29) id#0AO1497841 had areas on her muzzle around her tail and on her rear
legs that had matted hair balls. Matted hair on the dog can cause discomfort & could lead to infection or health
problems for that dog. Mobility of the dog could also be affected with the discomfort or pain associated with matted
hair constantly pulling on the skin of the dog. The potential for the skin to become inflamed or infected exists with
continued scratching. Matted hair does not maintain the same insulating qualities of normally groomed hair.
Regular grooming of matted hair is necessary to ensure the health & well being of all dogs. Licensee representative
advised the matted hair would be removed as completion of inspection.
A female Shar Pei (cid:28)Tiger Lilly(cid:29) id# 0A01497841 had toenails that needed trimming. The toenails were beginning
to curl back into the pad, affecting the dog(cid:25)s normal posture. Long toenails can affect the mobility of the dogs and
can cause discomfort. During the inspection there were other dogs that had toenails that needed trimming.
Licensee must ensure that all the dogs toenails are routinely maintained. Licensee representative advised that the
toenails would be trimmed after completion of inspection.
