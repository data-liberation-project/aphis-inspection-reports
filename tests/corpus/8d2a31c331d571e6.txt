ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:30AM to
10:30AM on 13-Jun-17.
I knocked on the door and waited for 30 minutes. Nobody answered and I did not see anybody on property while
there.
