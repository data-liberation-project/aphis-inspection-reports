OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
c) Construction.
**In the outdoor facility there are 2 wooden shelters that have wooden frames around the entry for the dogs. The
wooden frame is excessively scratched and chewed all the way around. Some of the scratched areas have slivers
of wood poking out. The exposed inner surfaces of the wood frames are not impervious to moisture due to the
excessive scratching and chewing. The wood surface cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized because of the rough
surface. It can become a place for insects and bacteria to live and grow and be in close contact with the dogs. To
ensure a healthy, clean and safe environment for the dogs, the owner must repair, replace or remove the chewed
and scratched wooden door frames. Any replacement or repair with wood must also be treated to make it
impervious to moisture. A schedule of more frequent maintanance must be done to ensure a safe, healthy
environment for the dogs.
