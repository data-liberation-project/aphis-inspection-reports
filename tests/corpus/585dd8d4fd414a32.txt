Facilities, general.
Although the side walls of the enclosures measured 7 inches in height, during the inspection, two guinea pigs were
observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
