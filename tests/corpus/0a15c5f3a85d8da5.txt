2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a single female ferret that is thin, has thinning hair, and appears weak. After speaking with the attending
veterinarian, it was confirmed that she was contacted by the facility regarding the ferret. However, the attending
veterinarian would not be available to provide care in a reasonable amount of time and recommended the facility contact
another veterinarian for care. Per the licensee, no other veterinary clinics were contacted to have the ferret evaluated.
Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to diagnose and treat disease. The licensee must get veterinary care for the ferret.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
