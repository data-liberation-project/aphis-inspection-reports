3.101(a)(1)

Facilities, general.
At time of the inspection, assorted tools, bikes, and household clutter are leaning against the wall and on the floor
adjacent to the enclosure and pool for 2 California Sea Lions and 1 South American Sea Lion. The sea lions can freely
access this area by going down the steps of the platform after exiting the pool. Storing items in the enclosure poses a risk
of injury to the animals. Facilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound and must be remained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury.
