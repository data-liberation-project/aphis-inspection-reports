Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:18PM on 20 April
2021. Contacted licensee on cell requesting a routine inspection. Licensee informed me they had just returned home from
travel, and today was not a good day to inspect. I reconfirmed current optimal hours as M-F anytime after 12pm and
explained that this would be an attempted inspection. Licensee verbalized that he understood.
