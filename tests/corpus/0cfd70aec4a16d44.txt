ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a written Program of Veterinary Care from the owners veterinarian in Montana. This veterinarian is going
to remain as her primary veterinarian visiting at least twice a year. A second veterinarian for emergency purposes
and hands on treatment is required. A written Program of Veterinary Care describing which animals will be seen
and medical care provided by the emergency veterinarian needs to be completed.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Giant Flemish rabbit has matted fur on its rump. Animals should be free of matted fur, which can lead to
dermatitis, including skin infections, limitations of movement and discomfort. This mat was removed during this
inspection.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Although this facility mostly conducts guided tours, it is arranged as a walk-through animal exhibit. One exhibit(cid:25)s
barrier consists of trees with a single thick rope about 3 feet high between them. This serves as a visual barrier, but
does not prevent people and especially small children from going past the rope and up to enclosure. All enclosures
housing animals are required to have barriers that prevent the public from directly accessing the enclosure. These
barriers should be sturdy enough to prevent the public (adults and children) from climbing over, under, around, or
through them to assure the safety of the animals and the public.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two New Guinea Singing Dogs are each in separate wood and wire enclosures. Not all of the wood structures in
one of the enclosures (Mick) are sealed with waterproof stain as a few areas were missed. In the second dog
enclosure (Sheila), there is green microbial growth on the wood in several areas and one platform has lost its stain
coating. These areas need to be sanitized and resealed. All surfaces in which dogs come in contact must bemaintained on a regular basis.
3.78(e)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The public barriers in front of the primates are not adequate to prevent physical contact between the public and the
nonhuman primates. The capuchin and brown lemur are in separate enclosures on either side of a sheltered
building leading to a large room housing animals. Some panels of metal fencing are loosely placed in front of these
cages to serve as barriers. These are inadequate as they are easily moveable and they are too close to the
primates cages. A metal fence of sufficient height is in front of the two outdoor cages housing the 2 ring tailed
lemurs and the one vervet, but the fence is incomplete and easy to walk around. If public members come into the
indoor large animal room with the two bush babies, then a barrier is needed to keep the public from coming into
contact with the primates. All barriers need to be adequate to protect the public and the animals.
3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The owner brought a brown lemur and a bush baby to the new facility to add to the existing primate collection of a
capuchin, vervet, two ring tailed lemurs, a marmoset, and a bush baby. The current environment enhancement plan
does not include all of the primates currently on the property and does not adequately address the particular
environmental enrichment needs of each species. A new written plan needs to be developed with and approved by
the Attending Veterinarian to describe how the social needs of these primates will be met, including the four who are
singly housed. The enrichment plan needs to be species specific in describing the environmental enrichments
provided due to the different cognitive abilities and behavioral needs of these primates. The plan needs to be in
accordance with currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference
guides, and as directed by the Attending Veterinarian.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is no separate 6 foot perimeter fence at least 3 feet away from the primary enclosure for the yak in a front
pasture housed with several horses, nor for the young camel housed with the two llamas in an enclosure which has
one side consisting of part of the six foot perimeter fence for the rest of the exotic animals. Either a separate
perimeter fence needs to be built or a variance from the perimeter fence requirement needs to be requested and
approved.3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
A large number of leaf nosed bats (estimates of 80 to 100) are housed in a wood and wire structure measuring 6
feet tall by 4 feet by 4 feet. This structure is pyramidal shaped and narrower at the top, probably only 3 feet X 3 feet
and contains no darkened roosting spaces. Bats are nocturnal and sufficient darkened roosting spaces must be
made available in the primary enclosure during daylight hours.
This is a pre-use site inspection for a second site for a Montana licensee. No licensed activity allowed until above
items have been corrected and no other items are found in non-compliance.
Exit interview conducted on 8-19-15 with VMOs Lisa MacElderry and Mary Ann McBride.
