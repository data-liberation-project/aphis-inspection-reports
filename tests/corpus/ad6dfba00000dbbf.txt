ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A guinea pig (white body with yellow/black head markings across from pen #12) had problems in the left eye. The
eye could not be seen and appeared to have wetness around the eye. The area where the eye-ball would be was
white (normally the eyeballs are black). Eye problems can be painful. This problem was not communicated to the
attending veterinarian. This guinea pig must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian so that it can be determined
what the problem is and receive treatment. Health problems must be communicated to the veterinarian and the
veterinarian's recommended treatment must be followed.
3.26(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
(b) Ventilation.
I noted a strong ammonia odor that caused a mild burning sensation to my throat during the inspection. Strong
ammonia odor can cause animals to get sick. To decrease ammonia odors, more fresh-air flow must be provided
while maintaining the indoor temperature between 60-85 degrees F. Increased cleaning of wet bedding can also
decrease ammonia odors.
3.28(a)(3) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Most of the enclosures had a buildup of soiled and wet bedding around the watering lines. Animals could not get a
drink without getting their feet wet. Wet and soiled bedding can increase animals' risk of getting sick. All
enclosures must be cleaned at least every two weeks or as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of soiled
material. Spot-cleaning of wet areas must be done so that animals can drink without getting their feet wet.
Cleaning more often can also help decrease ammonia odors.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
