Sanitation.
There was a heavy buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the floors and sides of 10 white enclosures on the left
side of the guinea pig building. There were 25 enclosures out of 64 enclosures with excessive accumulations of excreta
(feces) and debris. There was not enough bedding present to cover feces in these enclosures. Inadequate cleaning and
sanitation can increase the risk of disease and cause health problems. Correct by ensuring that the primary enclosures
are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta, soiled/wet bedding, and debris. In
addition, enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
