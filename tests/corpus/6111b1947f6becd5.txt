FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The main gate into the hippo enclosure is not secure. There is a space at the bottom between the 2 sections of
gate. The chain and lock that secures the bottom of the gate is on the ground. The licensee stated the lock was
broken. The gate is hung with post pins pointing up. This manner of hanging the gate may allow the gate to be lifted
off the hinges by the hippo. The space between the bars of the gate is large enough that the hippo may be able to
reach thru the gate and lift it up and off the hinges. The hippo has grown considerably over the last few years and
there is now concern that the height of the gate may allow the hippo to reach over the gate. One piece of hot wire
was on the ground by the gate. Hot wire on the ground would cause the hot wire system to fail. The gate must be
replaced with a gate that has the structural strength to contain an animal such as a hippo. It must also be properly
hung and secured with locks and chains at all times to prevent escape. Electric fencing along all sides of the
enclosure must be checked daily and with sufficient frequency to ensure it is functioning properly and repairs made
immediately. A hippo is a strong, dangerous animal and the enclosure must be maintained at all times in good
repair to prevent escape or injury.
Note : The hot wire was corrected at time of the inspection.
Chain and lock to be placed on bottom of gate. Correct By: 1/8/16 Gate Replacement Correct By : 4/8/16

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Water is collecting at the end of the hippo enclosure by the gate creating a large area of standing water and mud.
There was a green slime noted on the mud. Although a mud wallow may benefit the animal, the present location is
a problem as it is in front of the main entrance to the enclosure. There is also concern that the large amount of mud
and water may compromise the strength of the support post to the gate in this area and will hinder access with
equipment into the enclosure to make repairs to the enclosure. Water must be prevented from accumulating in front
of the gate to the enclosure.
