3.1(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
In Cheetah Complex 2, where a domestic dog is housed with a cheetah, there is excessive rust along the bottom edge of
the metal dividing wall between bedroom 2 and the air conditioned room. This area of rust has been previously
addressed with a temporary fix, but has rusted again and the permanent correction has not been completed. The facility
addressed the rust by repainting during inspection, and is planning for the permanent correction. Rust can create
structural issues and cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized as required.
