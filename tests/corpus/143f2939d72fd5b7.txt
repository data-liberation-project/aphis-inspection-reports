ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Shih Tzu (ID # 002) has hair loss covering its back and along part of its abdomen. I estimate the amount
of hair loss to be covering approximately 70% of the dog's body. In addition there is a sore in the middle of its back
that appears to be healing. The licensee stated the dog started losing its hair about three weeks ago. He has not
called the Attending Veterinarian as he thought the dog was shedding and he wasn't worried about it.
Hair loss can indicate an underlying heath issue that may be contagious to other dogs or even humans. In addition,
the severe amount of hair loss can make it difficult for the dog to properly maintain its body temperature. The
licensee must contact the Attending Veterinarian and treat the dog per his/her instructions.
Correct by 5/12/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
