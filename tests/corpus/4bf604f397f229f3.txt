2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During a 6 week period in the summer, from June 19 to July 31, there were 10 fawns that died at the facility. In most
cases the fawns were found dead with undetermined cause of death. The facility reported they left a message with the
secretary at the office of the attending veterinarian but did not follow up and the attending veterinarian confirmed there
was no communication regarding the possible causes or measures to address the deaths.
Failure to communicate information about problems of animal health in a timely manner with the attending veterinarian
can result in continued illness and death.
The facility must ensure there is an adequate method of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Correct from this day forward

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
