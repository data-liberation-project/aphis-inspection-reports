2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 on
23-Feb-17.The licensee's wife indicated that the licensee was not home and would not be available for inspection.
The licensee will be in contact with the inspector to establish availability.
Lack of availability and access for inspection makes the regulatory process impossible. Licensees must have a
knowledgeable, responsible adult available for inspection during business hours, or otherwise establish optimal
hours of availability.
Correct from this time forward.
