3.14(a)(6)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
The removable, plastic transport carriers do not have "live animal" labels. Transport enclosures that are not
permanently affixed to the vehicle should be labeled so that the enclosures are easily and quickly identifiable as
containing live animals, to insure the safety of the animals as well as those handling the carriers.The registrant shall
ensure that the carriers are clearly marked on top and on one or more sides with the words ``Live Animals,'' in
letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the
primary enclosure. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 3/29/2016

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
The plastic animal carriers the registrant is using to contain animals during transport has a solid plastic floor. The
registrant uses a single bath towel to cover the bottom of the crate. The towel can be displaced by the animal or
completely removed from the base of the crate leaving nothing to absorb excreta. Keeping animals clean, dry and
unsoiled is an important aspect of animal husbandry and helps prevent the spread of disease. The licensee shall
ensure that unless the dogs and cats are provided raised flooring, that the primary enclosure contains enough
previously unused litter to absorb and cover excreta. The litter must be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe
and nontoxic to the dogs and cats. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 2/29/2016

PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
The registrant was using an outdoor, single burner propane heating unit inside the animal area of the transport
trailer. Due to the health risks of carbon monoxide poisoning the heater is intended to be used outdoors and in well
vented areas. Additionally, the propane tank and heater were not secured at the time of the inspection. The
registrant stated that the nylon strap normally used to secure the heater and tank had broken. This unsecured
heater and attached propane tank poses a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, fire, or explosion. The registrant shall
ensure the transport trailer and animal area is equipped with a heat source that does not pose a threat to the safety
and well-being of the animals or caretakers. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 2/29/20163.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
The registrant is using large, unsecured, metal food and water bowls placed in the front portion of the transport
carriers. These food and water receptacles take up a large portion of the animal's space in the carriers and because
they are unsecured, they are hard to fill from the outside of the enclosure and easily overturned. The registrant shall
ensure that the food and water receptacles are securely attached inside the primary enclosures and placed so that
the receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosures without opening the door. TO BE CORRECTED

CARE IN TRANSIT.
Our office received an official complaint that the registrant has been transporting animals outside of their
enclosures, in the cab of his truck. The registrant took photos of an adult Boxer and an adult Chocolate Labrador
being transported in the backseat of his truck and displayed them on social media. The photos were labeled with
captions confirming the dogs were consigned to him for transport. The registrant confirmed that he the transported
animals outside of their enclosures. Animals are required to be contained in an enclosure to ensure their safety, as
well as that of the other animals and handlers in contact with them. The registrant shall ensure the except during
the cleaning of primary enclosures, as required in Sec. 3.14(b) of this subpart, during transportation in commerce a
dog or cat must not be removed from its primary enclosure, unless it is placed in another primary enclosure or
facility that meets the requirements of Sec. 3.6 or Sec. 3.14 of this subpart. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 2/29/2016
