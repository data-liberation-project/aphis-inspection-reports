All outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of
sufficient height, not less than 6' for non-dangerous species, to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The
fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
A perimeter fence must be constructed or a perimeter fence variance must be requested.3.130
