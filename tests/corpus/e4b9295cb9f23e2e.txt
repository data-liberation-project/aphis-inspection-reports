56 degrees F according to the inspector's Kestrel. According to the label on the vaccines they should be stored between

from contagious and/or deadly diseases.

Each dealer must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The facility must
ensure that the vaccines are stored at the proper temperature in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
