ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30 pm on
12-Oct-17.
** I arrived at the facility at 12:30 pm. The owner came outside to explain there was an emergency and she couldn't
conduct an inspection at that time. I left the premises at 1:00 pm.
