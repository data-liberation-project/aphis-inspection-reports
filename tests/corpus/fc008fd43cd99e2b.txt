2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Daisy is a 20 month old tiger at the facility. APHIS inspectors first noticed that she was having balance issues in
September 2016. At that time inspectors were shown records that indicated that the attending veterinarian had
diagnosed otitis externa and otitis media on September 26, 2016. This diagnosis was done without immobilization
or hands on examination of the tiger. The veterinarian had treated Daisy for a jaw abscess earlier in the summer of
2016. He assumed the ataxia was due to infection traveling from the jaw and infecting her middle and outer ear.
Daisy has been off and on combinations of antibiotics and steroids since that time. Daisy’s condition was noted to
be much worse on an APHIS inspection on November 9, 2016. In response to the inspection report, Daisy was
immobilized for an examination and blood collection. Blood work was not remarkable and Daisy was again treated
for an inner ear infection. The attending veterinarian noted no obvious jaw or ear issues on the physical
examination done at this time. (This was relayed to Animal Care’s big cat specialist in a phone conversation that
took place on March 29, 2017.) There can be other diagnoses which can be the cause of Daisy’s symptoms,
toxoplasmosis being highly likely. This information has been shared with the attending veterinarian on at least two
occasions. The latest time was a phone conversation between Animal Care’s big cat specialist and the attending
veterinarian for the facility on March 29, 2017. Despite this information, a toxoplasmosis titer has never been done
for Daisy and Daisy has never been treated with an antibiotic effective against toxoplasmosis at a high enough dose
and for a long enough duration to be effective against the infection. Records reviewed on the inspection of April, 25,
2017 showed that since the time of the inspection on March 20, 2017, no additional diagnostics have been done.
Daisy has been on various doses of prednisone and prednisone in combination with Baytril. Daisy has been on
daily prednisone since the time of the inspection on April, 25, 2017. Today the CEO of the facility stated to APHIS
inspectors that Daisy has had several bad days lately and that they have increased her prednisone dose. Daisy
was extremely reluctant to move. She was hiding in the back of her enclosure in a in a sternal position under her
perch. It took seven minutes of coaxing in order to get her to move. Daisy then did move inside her shelter. With
more coaxing Daisy moved to her water receptacle located in the front of the outdoor portion of the enclosure. This
is a distance of about 15 feet. Daisy appeared lethargic and slumped against the enclosure fence resting her head
on the water receptacle. Daisy appeared to be exhausted from the effort it took to reach the water receptacle and
her head tilt was apparent while she was drinking. Her tail still demonstrates a corkscrew appearance. Her hair
coat appears dull and rough. Today Daisy was growling and wanted to stay at the back of her enclosure
withdrawing from inspectors. This is a contrast to inspections in the past where Daisy has had a more curious andsocial attitude towards the APHIS inspectors. No diagnostics have been done for Daisy since the time of the last
inspection. The lack of a diagnosis and effective treatment is causing the continued suffering of the tiger. A
knowledgeable, expert veterinarian who specializes in exotic medicine (with training in big cat medicine) must be
consulted. Results of this consultation must be documented and records must be available for APHIS review at the
time of the next inspection.
The white tiger known as Mohan is walking with a very stiff and hesitant gait today. When the enclosure was first
approached Mohan was lying down. Mohan rose slowly and walked with a hitching and awkward gait. Mohan's
stance was bowlegged in appearance and he walked very slowly for about 20 feet before immediately lying down
again. APHIS inspectors have discussed the condition of this tiger on previous inspections but Mohan appears
much worse today. The CEO has stated on previous occasions that the attending veterinarian has evaluated
Mohan but that he has not wanted to treat him as he thinks that it is an old age condition and that pain medications
would lead to renal failure. Mohan has had no diagnostics done that would indicate that this could be a concern.
Mohan appears to be in extreme pain today. Mohan is suffering in his current condition and is in need of veterinary
evaluation. Veterinary treatment recommendations must be documented and made available for APHIS inspectors.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee was asked to show APHIS inspectors the record of animals on hand. The licensee was unable to
produce the required records at time of inspection. These records are used to trace and track animals and to
estimate age of the animals for health concerns. Of particular concern on this inspection was a tiger known as
Mohan. Mohan was experiencing ambulatory difficulty at the time of inspection and inspectors wanted to verify that
Mohan was in his mid-twenties as the CEO of the facility stated to them.
Correct by: Correct from this time forward.
3.81(c)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The nonhuman primate enrichment plan does not address the two nonhuman primates housed in the warm room.
These nonhuman primates must be given special consideration in the nonhuman primate enrichment plan as they
are currently not able to see each other in their current housing arrangement. Address extra enrichment to be given
these animals in the nonhuman primate enrichment plan.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a board approximately 12” by 18” that had several nails sticking straight up in the Syrian brown bear
enclosure. This board was in an area that the bears frequently pace, just to the right of the food bin. The area on
the shelter, where the board with nails came from, also has nails sticking out of it. Housing facilities must be
maintained in good repair to prevent injury to the bears contained in the enclosure.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Deteriorating bags of lettuce, discolored broccoli, discolored brussel
sprouts and molding corn were present in the cooler. This produce was stored on the already sorted (feed side of
the cooler). Spoiled produce must be removed promptly to prevent contamination of food intended to be fed to the
animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce promptly. This cooler needs to be cleaned and have spoiled and
deteriorating items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will be fed to the animals. The
facility CEO states that produce is sorted again prior to feeding but the condition of the produce in the Asian black
bear, North American black bear and grizzly bear enclosures make it impossible for APHIS inspectors to determine
if this is true.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Sections of the perimeter fence near Mohan's enclosure and near the grizzly bear enclosure are becoming over run
with vines and trees. This excess of vegetation must be trimmed back to ensure the structural integrity of the fence
and to allow for proper inspection of the fence. Large, dangerous animals are housed at this facility and the
perimeter fence serves as a secondary barrier between these animals and the public. Any animal escape could
have potentially lethal outcomes for the animal or a member of the public. Remove excess vegetation from these
sections of the perimeter fence and any other areas of the perimeter where it is needed.
3.129(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
There are two approximately 2 year old Syrian brown bears at the facility. These two bears have rough, dull looking
hair coats, are thin and appear undersized for their age. At the time of the last inspection the CEO described a
recent meal fed to the bears as consisting of: approximately 10 gallons of apples, pears and carrots, 2 pounds of
cheese and 2 to 3 gallons of cake trimmings. Based on our discussions with the CEO of the facility, APHIS
inspectors think that a diet poor in nutritional content may be responsible for the appearance of these bears. These
bears are still young and growing. Inadequate diet at this point in their life will lead to lifelong complications. This
can result in a lifetime of unnecessary suffering for these bears. A diet plan must be developed for these bears. Itshould be written plan and it must be approved by the attending veterinarian. All items to be fed to the bears must
be specified in the plan. Amounts and combinations of food items must be specified in enough detail so it is
possible to determine if the meal is nutritionally adequate. Frequency of daily feedings and approximate feeding
times must be documented in the feeding plan. Meals should be documented with time of day and all items and
amounts fed noted. This documentation must be available for review by APHIS officials. Special consideration
must be given to calcium level in the diet as these bears are not fully grown and require more calcium in their diet
than an adult bear. Inadequate calcium levels could lead to conditions such as metabolic bone disease which
would cause pain and suffering for these bears. The CEO stated to APHIS inspectors today that the facility has not
begun to develop a diet plan or record items fed to the bears.
The CEO of the facility also stated to APHIS inspectors that since the time of the last inspection 21 days ago that he
has contacted a feed mill about formulating a bear diet that he intends to feed to these bears. No time frame was
given to inspectors for when this will be accomplished.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle boxes for the American black bear and Asian black bear enclosures need to be cleaned. There
is a large amount of rotting food debris in the Asian black bear enclosure and den area. These bear food receptacle
boxes have walls and sides which are very dirty. These food receptacles are not sanitary. The grizzly bear is being
fed on the dirt floor inside its shelter. Any food fed in this areas is going to be contaminated by the rotting material
present. These feeders need to be cleaned and made sanitary to ensure that the food fed to the bears is
wholesome and free from bacterial or pest infestation which could result in health issues for the bears. Diarrhea
was noted inside the enclosure for the North American black bears.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the cougar had a large amount of brown algae sludge coating its
interior and floating in the water. This water receptacle is not being cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis.
Water receptacles should be kept clean and sanitary to promote adequate water consumption which is essential for
animal health. Clean and sanitize water receptacles more frequently.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION. There was excessive feces in the tiger known as Lilly's enclosure. There was excessive food waste inside the tiger
known as Pandora's shelter. There was excessive food waste in the Syrian brown bear enclosure. There was
excessive food waste in the tiger known as Mohan's enclosure. There was excessive food waste in the den area of
Mohan's enclosure. There is excessive food waste and feces in the Asian black bear enclosure. There was rotting
produce and excessive food waste and feces in the Asian black bear enclosure. There was loose stool and
excessive feces in the North American black bear den. There was a piece of rotting meat in the North American
black bear enclosure. The pool in the North American black bear pen was filled with very bright green algae tinted
water. There is rotting food debris present in the feed area for the grizzly bear and in the grizzly bear enclosure.
There was excessive food waste and rotting material present in the cougar den box. An enclosure housing one fox
contained rotting food waste. These enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis. This rotting material
and feces can lead to pest control issues. With warmer weather coming to the area quite soon these odor and pest
control issues will be exacerbated. The rotting material present in these animal enclosures can contaminate them
as they lie in their enclosures. These animals can ingest this material when they groom. Not removing old food
waste promptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting this rotten material can lead to potential health
problems. Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of food and fecal waste to minimize odors
and prevent potential health problems for the animals housed in them.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The entire premises is filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash old animal enclosures and fence.
Several other buildings on the property are also filled with old equipment and debris and trash. Tall weed were
present in many area of the facility. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and
numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
The cabinet under the butcher counter is rotting away do to a water leak. An old cooler right outside the butcher
area is overgrown with mold. These conditions make it impossible to properly clean these areas. Remove all this
trash and repair the cabinet and water leak so that this food preparation area can be cleaned and sanitized.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Many rodent holes were located throughout the facility. A rodent hole was located next to the tiger known as
Pandora's enclosure. A rodent hole was located next to the tiger known as Mohan's enclosure. A rodent hole was
noted going under the shelter for the cougar enclosure. A rodent hole was located in a monkey enclosure not
currently in use. Rodent feces was noted on shelves inside the warm room. Rodents can be carriers of disease
which may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of rodent control must beestablished for the facility.
3.132 CRITICAL REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that despite the reduction in animal numbers that there is a lack of adequately trained employees. The
persistence of multiple animal welfare act violations related to basic animal husbandry issues illustrates this point.
The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can result in facility and animal
conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly trained
workers need to be added.
An exit interview was conducted at the conclusion of the facility inspection with the CEO. All non-compliant items
were discussed. A formal exit interview was conducted with the facility CEO on 5-18-17.
