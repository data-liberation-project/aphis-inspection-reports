2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The donkey, ponies and zebra were housed together in an outdoor paddock overnight, weather permitting. These
animals are returned to their stalls in the morning for feeding. This was a daily routine.
On the morning of April 13, 2014, the juvenile zebra was injured by a pony or ponies that were housed with him in a
paddock near the main barn. According to the owner, the animals are fed in the morning and then returned to a
paddock for the afternoon. The animals were not returned to their stalls at the usual time.
Since the animal handlers did not follow the usual feeding routine in a timely manner, the cause of the trauma to the
zebra could have possibly been avoided.
The handling of the animals housed in the paddock was not done expeditiously as possible thus resulting in the
injury and subsequent death of the zebra.
HANDLING PROCEDURES SHOULD BE CORRECTED TO PREVENT TRAUMA AND PRIOR TO OBTAINING
ANY NEW ANIMALS.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
