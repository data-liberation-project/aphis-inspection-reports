2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were 18 lab puppies under 16 weeks of age from 3 different females that did not have puppy records. While
the licensee did have cage cards, there were no puppy records with all of the required information for record
keeping.
It is important to keep updated and complete records on all regulated animals and their offspring for proper
management and care of the animals.
The licensee must keep complete puppy records on all puppies born at the facility.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The majority of the kennels have a large buildup of brown grime and dirt on the walls, both sides of the doggy doors
and door inserts. While the enclosures are cleaned daily, the surfaces need to be scrubbed free of the dirt and
grime buildup. The last enclosure next to the wall needs to have the cracks sealed between the floor and wall to
prevent the buildup of dirt, hair and feces from collecting in the cracks.
The buildup of dirt and grime can be a source of bacteria or parasites that could be a potential health hazard for the
regulated animals.
The enclosures must be cleaned thoroughly and scrubbed often enough to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime on
all surfaces in contact with the animals, including walls, feeders and floors. All cracks should be filled to prevent the
accumulation of debris. Without proper cleaning, the surfaces can not be sanitized.
