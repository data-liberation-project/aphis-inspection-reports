Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Nine of the outdoor enclosures had an excessive amount of feces and other material. The snow and ice melted and the
ground was very wet, causing the feces to soften and cake into the plastic flooring sections in the enclosures. The plastic
flooring sections were barely visible, as they were so caked with mud and feces. There was feces and mud on the bellies
and legs of several of the smaller dogs. Excessively soiled enclosures can lead to increased disease hazards or
discomfort for the animals, odors, and/or attract unwanted pests. Dogs that must walk through their feces to move about
their enclosure are more susceptible to skin infections and intestinal parasites.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained
in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.

Correct from this day forward by removing excess feces on at least a daily basis.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
