Facilities, general.
The walk-in cooler had a strong odor of spoilage. The floor was wet and broken. Water was filling in under the flooring
and odors and food waste could be trapped under it. This flooring could also allow vermin in. The vent covering was
rusted and water was dripping from the ceiling. Supplies of food shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect
such supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. Refrigeration shall be provided for supplies of
perishable food. This flooring needs to be repaired or replaced to prevent the water and food waste from becoming
trapped underneath and to discourage vermin from entering. Repairs need to be addressed to prevent water from
dripping into the food. The vent needs to be replaced so that it can be cleaned properly.

Watering.
The two metal water bowls used for the fishing cats were green with algae. These bowls were setting in the full sun so
the water is not staying cool. If the water is not palatable the animals won't drink enough for optimal health. All water
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

Sanitation.
In the caracal enclosure there were old white feces stuck in the right front corner between the enclosure chain mesh and
the resting platform. Feces need to be removed as they can attract vermin and insects to the animal which are disease
hazards. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. This needs to be removed and cleaned
properly.
