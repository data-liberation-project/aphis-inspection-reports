SANITATION.
Several rows of empty rabbit enclosures and shelving units had not been cleaned since the animals were moved.
The soiled enclosures and shelves contained what appeared to be dried fecal material and crumbled food pellets,
and were in the same room and directly adjacent to other rabbits. According to staff at the facility the rabbits had
been moved approximately two weeks prior to the inspection.
Decomposing organic material may create noxious odors and attract vermin, thus adversely impacting the health
and well-being of the animals housed nearby. The facility should ensure that buildings and grounds are kept clean
in order to protect the animals.
