ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a 240 ml bottle containing SpectoGard/Scour-Chek (spectinomycin oral solution 50 mg for pig scours) at
the facility and deemed ready for use. The medication was administered by the facility representative approximately
six weeks ago to an adult female Siberian Husky that had a litter of puppies at the time. The facility representative
stated the dog was given 2-3 ml after it was observed with a loose stool. The medication is not labeled for use in
dogs and is not listed in the facility's program of veterinary care.
Failure to have proper authorization and specific instructions for use from a veterinarian does not ensure that proper
dosing and administration of products is being accomplished. Further, it does not ensure that dogs are receiving
appropriate veterinary care within currently accepted veterinary practices. The licensee must have proper
authorization, labels and instructions for use from a veterinarian.
2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are two records of disposition forms (APHIS 7006) that are inaccurate and incomplete. The APHIS form 7006
with a disposition date of September 22, 2015 has information listed in section 4 and 4A that is not accurate. The
actual buyer/receiver is different from the information provided on the forms. The APHIS form 7006 with a litter of
Siberian Husky puppies listed with identification numbers 1701-1707 is not filled out completely and missing
information in sections 6-12. The APHIS form 7006 with a litter of Siberian Husky puppies listed with identification
numbers 1601-1604, 1607-1609 is also not filled out completely. Section G, 6, 9, 11 and 12 are blank. Sections 7
and 8 contain inaccurate information and does not list the actual shipper and driver.
Complete and accurate records of disposition forms ( APHIS 7006) provide a source of information to facilitate the
ability to trace and verify the location of all dogs after the transaction is completed. The licensee must maintain
records (APHIS 7006) which fully and accurately disclose all information concerning the transaction of all dogs in
their possession.
