3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
A dog arrived at SFO Airport after traveling from Boise via Seattle on Alaska Airlines, waybill # 027-BOI-3181-6853.
The primary enclosure did not have a consignor's declaration with instructions for feeding and watering during
transport. There was a document underneath the waybill info, enclosed in plastic, and not clearly visible during
transport, where the shipper had filled out info regarding when the dog had last been offered food and water, but
there were no instructions for feeding and watering while en route, and the info was not visible during transit.
Failure to complete and attach a written consignor's certification regarding feeding and watering could have a
negative impact on the well-being of the animal. The airline should ensure that complete information is provided on
each crate, by the consignor, prior to taking possession of the animal.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with airline representatives at the cargo office.
