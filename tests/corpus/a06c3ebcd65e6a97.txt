Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*An adult, male goat still has a large split in the wall of his outside left front hoof. Also, several goats were noted to have
overgrown hooves characterized by turning up and curling. Abnormalities in the hoof wall and overgrown hooves can lead
to chronic hoof problems, conformation issues, lameness, and further pain and suffering. According to the licensee, the
split hoof had been trimmed since the time of the last inspection and the next planned date of hoof trimming is in the
spring. The licensee was not aware that the hoof was still split and this issue of hoof wear needs to be monitored and
addressed for preventative care.

*Two young alpacas are thin with the black alpaca having a prominent spine. The brown alpaca’s left eye had thick, white
discharge and his spine and hips were prominent. According to the licensee, they had observed the thin condition of the
brown alpaca approximately two weeks prior and attempted to correct by placing the food in an area out of competition
with the goats. The animals continue to be thin and despite the observation of the condition, it has not been
communicated to the Attending Veterinarian.

The licensee must ensure that daily observation is done on all animals to assess their health and that a mechanism of

direct and frequent communication is in place so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health is
conveyed to the Attending Veterinarian.
2.131(e) Critical

Handling of animals.
Several months ago the facility had a significant weather storm, and according to the the licensee, they noticed the male
wallaby was stressed by the weather but did not move the animal inside. During a check on the animals, they found the
male wallaby dead in the enclosure. The next day they moved the female inside the building. When climatic conditions
present a threat to the animal’s health or well being appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those
conditions.

Correct from this day forward.
3.13(a)(4) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
The female wolf hybrid is still heavily matted behind the ears, around the neck and along the back legs with mud stuck to
the matted fur. Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin and traps dirt, which can be painful and no longer acts as an
insulator against heat or cold temperatures. This animal needs to have preventative grooming to eliminate the matted fur
to ensure a healthy coat moving into winter months for its health and comfort.
3.51(b)

Facilities, indoor.
Upon entering the indoor housing facility, there was a strong smell of ammonia that made the USDA inspectors' eyes
water and they could smell through their masks. The licensee turns on fans upon entering the building for husbandry work
in the morning but this does not account for overnight ventilation as perceived by the inspectors upon entry in the

morning. Indoor housing facilities must be adequately ventilated to provide for the health and comfort of the animals at all
times.

Classification and separation.
Two rabbits were housed in an enclosure with tortoises. Tortoises can potentially spread disease to other animals.
Rabbits can not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals for their health.

This item was corrected at the time of inspection.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
*The chain link at the top of the corner in the binturong enclosure is not fully connected to the top bar and creates a gap
large enough for an animal to get an appendage through. Also, the additional chain link mesh around the water bottle has
sharp edges that should be trimmed down for the safety of the animal.

*The metal food bucket is rusted around the edges and there is a small hole with sharp edges. This bucket is not in good
repair and should be replaced for the safety of the animals.

*An exercise wheel in a chinchilla enclosure has a section of wire mesh missing which could cause injury to the animal
when it is running on the wheel. This wheel should be replaced for the safety of animal.

*The wire gate panel for the bobcat enclosure is showing areas of rust along the bottom of the door that is now pitted and

flaking. This door needs to be kept in good repair for the containment of the animal.

*The wood shelter box for the foxes is in disrepair with a large hole across the top of the box. This box needs to be kept in
good repair for the safety of the animals as they jump on and around the box.

*The plastic mesh fabric wrapped around the top and sides of two of the outdoor enclosures has been shredded and
plastic fabric is on the ground in the enclosure. Goats can chew on and eat this plastic fabric leading to foreign body
ingestion.

* A goat was found outside the enclosure through a hole in the fencing. Fencing for primary enclosures must be
maintained in good repair for the safety and containment of the animals.

Facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
The shelter area on the back side of the main building for the goats and donkey is not usable, with 6 inches of muck that
is not walkable for the animals and the barn structure is not bedded down with bedding for the fall temperatures. This
needs to be addressed and the animals provided with a usable shelter area to protect them from inclement weather.

Watering.

A water bottle attached to a cage housing ferrets had visible algae floating in the water and along the side of the bottle.
Contaminated water can lead to decreased consumption by animals and subsequent dehydration and medical conditions.
This water bottle needs to be cleaned more frequently for the health the animals.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
*A significant amount of clutter was seen in the main building, the second building and around outdoor enclosures. Empty
enclosures, some dirty could be seen stacked above and below primary enclosures in use. Other items, such as toys and
boxes, were being stacked above the occupied enclosures.

*A moderate amount of spider webs and dust could be seen hanging from the ceiling, covering the top of enclosures, and
covering the skylights. The excessive dust along items hanging from the walls and ceiling attract and hold debris and
contribute to the odor of ammonia in the room. Unsanitary conditions in the areas surrounding primary enclosures housing
animals can also lead to unpleasant odors, attract pest and negatively impact animal welfare. Premises where housing
facilities are located, must be kept clean and free of clutter in order to facilitate husbandry practices and to protect the
animals from disease as well as injury. The facility needs to develop and follow a plan to store excess items in another
area to be able to facilitate cleaning in the buildings for the health of the animals.

Sanitation.

There was an accumulation of flies in the kinkajou enclosure and in the opossum enclosure. The facility is not using
sufficient measures to mitigate flies inside the buildings. Flies are known to be carriers of disease and can both cause and
spread illness between animals and species. A safe and effective program for controlling pests must be implemented and
maintained
