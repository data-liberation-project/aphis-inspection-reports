3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There was an excessive buildup of soiled bedding and debris in the corners of most enclosures by the water sipper
valves and feeding areas. Guinea pigs in these areas have to walk on wet soiled bedding to eat or drink. A build up
of wet and soiled areas in the enclosures could increase risk for sickness and increase odors in the building. To
promote animal health; spot clean soiled areas more often to ensure that guinea pigs have dry access to feed and
water.
