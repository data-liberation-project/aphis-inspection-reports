2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current Program of Veterinary care states that the raccoons will receive parvo/distemper and rabies
vaccinations. It does not address how often these vaccinations should be given. The veterinary signature page
indicates the attending veterinarian has not been to the facility since Dec 2013. The current Program of Veterinary
Care needs to provide more details about the veterinarian's recommendations for this facility. It should include
types of vaccinations and frequency they should be given. It should include any other preventative care the
veterinarian feels is appropriate such as fecal exams, deworming protocols, etc. It should also state how often the
veterinarian feels he/she needs to visit the facility to adequately consult on the health of the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The licensee does not currently have a perimeter fence around the area where animals are and will be permanently
housed outdoors. Facilities not entirely indoors must be enclosed by a perimeter fence. For non-dangerous
animals the fence must be a minimum of six feet high. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the
animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility. The licensee needs to build a perimeter fence or request a variance from the
Eastern Regional Director.
