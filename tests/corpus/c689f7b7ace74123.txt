FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The animal room has a strong ammonia smell. Adequate ventilation is required to keep odors to a minimum. Strong
smells such as ammonia can cause stress and be a health hazard for the animals.
Odors can be minimized by removing the source - cleaning more often and removing the dirty bedding from the
room - and/or moving more air by employing exhaust fans and air purifiers. Soiled bedding is being stored in the
animal room and is likely a significant contributor to the problem.
