ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A handwritten sign on one enclosure housing five kittens stated that they are currently being treated for respiratory
infections with Amoxi and eye medication. A second enclosure housing one kitten (orange and white domestic
shorthair) whose litter box had loose stool present in it coated with cat litter had a handwritten sign on it that stated
that the kitten was being treated with Metronidazole and Albon. All kittens appeared alert and active. The facility
representative stated that the attending veterinarian had been called this weekend and that medication was waiting
to be picked up at the vet's clinic. Acquisition records stated that the kittens have been at the store for the last 2-4
weeks. There was no documentation available to show when the vet had been contacted, what the vet's
recommendations were or when/with what the kittens had been treated. The attending veterinarian was not able to
be reached by phone (on vacation). The inspectors asked to see the medication that was being administered and
were shown the following: a large stock bottle of Albon (no directions specific to kitten) and a bottle of aquarium
metronidazole tablets that states on the label for use in aquariums only and expired on 5/2014. No bottle of Amoxi
was present at the facility. The facility representative stated that they ran out of Clavamox this weekend and had
thrown out the empty bottle. From the lack of treatment records available for review, lack of labeling of medication
used with kitten instructions (Metronidazole, Albon), use of exired medication (Metronidazole) and lack of
medication (Amoxi/Clavamox) available for use it was impossible to determine if appropriate methods are being
used to diagnose and treat these kittens. The attending veterinarian must be contacted and involved in the dianosis
and treatment of all diseases to ensure the health and well-being off the animals. For commonly treated conditions,
treatment plans can be approved in advance by the attending veterinarian and individual animal treatments
documented by facility staff. Appropriate methods must be used to prevent, control, diagnose and treat all diseases
and injuries. Correct by 6/20/14.

Inside the sugar glider enclosure are bags made of cloth and mesh for the animals to shelter in. The mesh on the
bag in one enclosure housing two sugar gliders is tearing apart. The animals could have their digits entangled in
the torn mesh, which could result in injury. All parts of the housing, including the bags, shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the sugar gliders from injury. Correct by: 06/20/14 Exit interview conducted with undersigned facility representative
