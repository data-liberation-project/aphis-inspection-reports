ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the medication storage portion of the facility, there was a bottle with a label that was worn and difficult to read
however, this medication expired 5/4/2016. There was also a bottle that had been relabeled as Cephalexin. This
label had no expiration date on it. Medications that are expired or have an unknown expiration date and are given to
the animals may not produce the desired result. The licensee must remove all expired medications from the ready
to use portion of the facility and assure that all medications are labeled appropriately, are within the expiration date
and provide adequate veterinary care at all times.

2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***In the whelping facility, there were three French Bulldog puppies approximately ten weeks old from two different
litters housed in the same enclosure. Another enclosure contained one miniature Pinscher and two French Bulldog
puppies that were nine weeks old. Another enclosure contained one French Bulldog puppy and an English Bulldog
puppy. Seven of these puppies had no form of identification attached to the dog while being housed in mixed litters.
***There was one enclosure that contained three unweaned Shih Tzu puppies. These puppies had no identification.
Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet record keeping requirements for inventory, disposition,
transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must identify all puppies that are less than 16 weeks old.
Acceptable forms of identification for puppies that are weaned and housed in mixed litters include a microchip, a
collar and tag, a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written or a cage card as long as all the
puppies in the enclosure are from the same litter.

WATERING.
***In the outdoor portion of the sheltered facility, there was an enclosure housing one white female French Bulldog.
There was another enclosure containing one male and two female miniature Pinschers. The water receptacles in
these enclosures were completely dry. The facility representative stated that the receptacles were just emptied to becleaned. When the inspectors requested water for these dogs, the receptacles were cleaned and placed back into
the enclosures. All of these dogs were attempting to drink prior to the receptacles being filled. The dogs were licking
droplets of water from the side of the receptacles. The French Bulldog drank consistently for over two minutes, the
female miniature Pinschers drank consistently for over two minutes and the male drank for over three minutes. The
abdominal areas of these dogs increased in size dramatically as they drank. When the inspector asked when the
dogs were last offered water, the facility representative stated that it was "about this same time yesterday." The
facility representative also stated that the dogs "are watered once a day." Lack of water can cause dehydration and
increases the risk of other medical conditions. The licensee must provide potable drinking water for the animals and
assure that the animals have potable water to drink as required.
This was corrected during the inspection and the facility representative understands that this is to remain corrected
from this day, February 14, 2017, forward.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***In the outdoor portion of the adult sheltered facility, on the outside of the southeast enclosure, there was a torn
plastic bag up against the enclosure fence, close enough to be reached with a paw. Portions of this bag were also in
the two most southern enclosures which contained four adult dogs.
***In the northern outdoor enclosure of this same facility, there was an extension cord that had been pulled through
the fence into this enclosure containing two adult dogs. This cord had several places that were chewed through the
safety covering and at least one place that was chew completely through exposing the wires within the cord. The
facility representative stated that the cord was used for the shop vac and was not plugged in at the time of
inspection. The cord was removed from the enclosure during the inspection. Discarded items and equipment that is
not stored appropriately and enters an enclosure can be eaten by the dogs and cause intestinal or other internal
issues. Cords can cause electrical shock if chewed while plugged in. The licensee must remove these items from
the enclosures and assure that the premises are kept clean as required.
