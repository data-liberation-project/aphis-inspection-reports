ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Female Shih Tzu #163 had pink tissue about the size of a pea near the tear duct area of the right eye, protruding
out onto the eye. On this same dog, the ID chain was tight and had caused sores around the dogs neck. These
sores were open lesions under the chain, and reddish skin around the same areas as the lesions. There was also
blood like matter on the left side of the dog between the ear and front shoulder.The hair was missing around the
neck in the area of the chain and lesions. The lesions were about 1/4" - 1/2" wide and circling the neck.
A female Maltese #142 was limping on its right front leg. After the licensee pulled the dog out, the inspector pointed
out to the licensee, the right foot (wrist area) could easily be felt moving in a direction that is not the normal direction
the foot should move. The licensee also felt the foot and acknowledged it was moving wrong.
These abnormal appearing areas and sores could be the result of injury, infection or a variety of veterinary medical
conditions which may be painful. The licensee must have these dogs examined by a veterinarian in order to ensure
that accurate diagnoses are obtained and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest Control.
***Throughout the facility, excessive flies were noticed around the animals, on the ground near animals, and food
and water waste located inside the dogs’ enclosures. These flies were concentrated around feces in the enclosures
as well as around food on the ground that had fallen to the ground or had been cleaned out of feeders. Many damp
areas in the pens also had many flies around those spots in the enclosures. Pests, such as flies, increase the risk of
disease hazards. The licensee must develop a program of safe and effective pest control to reduce or eliminate the
population of flies.
