2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This is a search inspection.
The facility is currently conducting regulated activity without a valid USDA license, shipping puppies sight unseen.
The owner was aware of needing a USDA license to ship puppies sight unseen. An application packet was sent
December 2013 and the pre-license process was started but never finished. APHIS officials obtained Air Waybills
that supports the shipment of puppies to multiple buyers in different states. The inspector made contact with the
owner and confirmed that the owner ships puppies sight unseen on a regular basis. The owner currently has 23
breeding females. A valid USDA license is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and to
comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. This facility must obtain a USDA license or discontinue
regulated activities.
*NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
*An exit briefing was conducted by APHIS personnel with the owner .
