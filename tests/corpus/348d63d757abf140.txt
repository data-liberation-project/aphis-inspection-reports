FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***On May 21, 2013 at 12:30 pm the facility received a shipment of piglets. All were in good condition upon arrival.
At 1:45 pm during a routine observation the supervisor noticed a piglet was trapped behind a resting board and
unresponsive. The supervisor freed the animal immediately. The attending veterinarian was on-site and responded
immediately confirming the animals death. The corrective action, the removal of all resting boards from the runs,
was performed immediately and two members of the IACUC discussed the event with the attending veterinarian.
Both members inspected the animal runs and confirmed that all runs were in good repair. This was an adverse
incident, it was unforeseen and did not involve experimental procedures. The housing facility must be constructed of
such strength as appropriate for the animal and to protect the animal from injury. It was corrected immediately
This was a focused inspection of the pig facility.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the attending veterinarian.
