INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
231 (e) (3) IACUC
A container of a commercially-available oral antibiotic solution was present in a cabinet of a surgical area utilized for
guinea pigs. Per facility personnel, this antibiotic is used for prophylaxis against post-operative infection on animals
in two protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The use of this antibiotic
was included in one approved protocol but not in the second.
Use of procedures not specifically approved by the IACUC may cause unnecessary pain or distress in the animals.
All proposals to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make a significant change in an ongoing activity
involving animals, must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals. The protocol must be
amended and approved prior to the next procedure for which the antibiotics would be used.

SANITATION.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs are manually washed in a sink for which the basin is significantly smaller than
the primary enclosure and is equipped with a standard faucet which directs water downward into the basin. The
design of the sink is not consistent with proper and complete cleaning and rinsing.
The facility standard operating procedure states that soiled cages are to be taken to the sink and washed with
soap/water or disinfectant and then rinsed. Cages may also be sanitized by washing and then spraying with a 10%
bleach/water solution. The minimum permissible sanitation per this SOP is being washed with soap/water and then
rinsed. Such cleaning is inconsistent with the cited regulation.
Improper sanitation can lead to a negative impact on health and the well-being of the animals from failing to removepathogens or chemicals used in the cleaning process.
A system of sanitation for the primary enclosures and other components used in the care of the animals such as
food receptacles must be utilized. Such a system for the primary enclosures for guinea pigs per regulation could
include sanitizing by washing them with hot water (180F.) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer,
or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by
cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam.

SANITATION.
The Oxy-SCR-Lid; Air-Tight Lid and Oxymax Standard Chamber used for guinea pigs had dust on various
components, such as hoses. Additionally, there was an accumulation of dust and debris near a screened opening,
which appeared to be consistent with an exhaust port of the Air-Tight Lid.
Failing to properly maintain and sanitize the anesthesia equipment may result in inadvertent exposure to trapped
pathogens or test articles and may interfere with the proper functioning of the anesthesia equipment.
A system of maintenance and sanitation for the anesthesia or other equipment to which the animals are exposed
must be utilized.
