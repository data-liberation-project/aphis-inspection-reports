Item 3.125 a
At the time of inspection it was noticed that 2 areas of rotted and broken wood siding had developed on the outdoor
housing for 2 of the wild boar.
Broken and rotted wood is not structurally sound nor is it in good repair to protect the animals.
Facility needs to repair/replace the rotted wood panels so as to ensure the housing facility is structurally sound and to
protect the animals from injury.
