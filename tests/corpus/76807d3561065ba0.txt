2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An approximately 5 year old brown and black female goat named Moon was seen alone, away from the rest of the
herd. The goat appeared lethargic standing with a hunched back, her head down and droopy eyes. She was
breathing rapidly and was often seen open mouth breathing. There was a moderate amount of thick sticky green
discharge in both nostrils and she occasionally coughed. The membranes lining the goat’s eyes were pale, almost
white in color. The goat was also seen grinding her teeth from time to time and a firm mass half an inch in diameter
was felt under her neck. The licensee had not identified the current condition affecting this goat, therefore had not
contacted the veterinarian for guidance on care. The licensee did explain that approximately a month ago, she
noticed swelling at the goat’s neck and treated her with a de-wormer suspecting a parasitic infection.
Failure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and distress in animals
with such conditions. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in order to
assess their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for
timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention. During the inspection, the licensee contacted the attending
veterinarian and received guidance on care for this goat.

WATERING.
The enclosure housing 8 goats and 10 sheep had a water bowl and a water through with a thick layer of slimy
green-brown fuzzy material coating the interior walls and the bottom. In the water bowl, there was a large amount of
fuzzy green material floating on the surface of the water. Unclean and unsanitary drinking water can cause illness
and discomfort to these animals. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.
