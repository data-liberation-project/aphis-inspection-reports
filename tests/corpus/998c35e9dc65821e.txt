Sharp points -
****
A chain link divider panel in between two enclosures, affecting 4 dogs, had at least 2 areas where there are bent
and/or twisted wires which have created sharp points. These sharp points were at dogs level and could cause
injury to the dogs. The licensee must repair/replace this section and ensure that all enclosures are free of sharp
points or edges that may injure the dogs at all times.
