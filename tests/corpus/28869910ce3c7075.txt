3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
There were 2 enclosures housing 4 dogs in outdoor enclosures without bedding in the shelters. According to National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the outdoor air temperature for the past 24 hours, in the area was 23
degrees F for a low and high of 42 degrees F with a temperature of 38 degrees F at the time of inspection. The dog
shelters were insulated but did not have any bedding. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing a sufficient source to
keep them warm increases the risk of stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. The licensee must ensure enclosures
contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F. Additional clean, dry bedding is
required when the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower.
3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The facility has outdoor enclosures with concrete floors, not impervious to moisture. There were 3 outdoor enclosures with
4 dogs that had concrete floors. The concrete floors are not impervious to moisture, therefore cannot be properly cleaned
and sanitized. The applicant must ensure all surfaces in contact with animals are impervious to moisture. The applicant
must ensure all surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis.
3.13

Veterinary care for dogs.

Although the applicant had the attending veterinarian do a hands on exam and do a fecal tests, these were not recorded
in the program of veterinary care. Also missing from the program of vet care was the preventative care section. Failure to
have these plans could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals. The Program of Veterinary
Care must include a frequency of hands on exam, parasite sampling/testing for fecals and heartworm and appropriate
plan of preventative care and treatment to maintain healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed toe nails, and
healthy teeth, ears, eyes and skin. The applicant must add the missing plans to the Program of Veterinary Care in order to
ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by 01/14/2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
