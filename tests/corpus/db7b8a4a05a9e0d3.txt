HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee has an adult red kangaroo that was on stage with him at a musical performance. The kangaroo was
shown to be inches from the audience at the edge of the stage. The licensee had no control over the animal that
could have jumped into the audience and been injured or worse. During pubic exhibition, any animal must be
handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and or suffient distance and/or barriers between the animal
and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of the animal. The licensee must never exhibit this animal
or any animal in this manner from this day forward.
Correct from this day forward
