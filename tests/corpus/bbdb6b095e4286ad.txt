3.28(c)(1)(iii) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
There were 2 guinea pig pens that did not provide the required amount of floor space. There was one pen with 32 and
one pen with 37 weanling guinea pigs. The pens measured 48 by 24 inches or 1,152 square inches of floor space. Each
weanling requires a minimum of 60 square inches of floor space. Total floor space required to house 32 and 37 weanlings
is 1,920 and 2,220 square inches respectively. There cannot be more than19 weanling guinea pigs housed in an
enclosure measuring 48 by 24 inches.
Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, and aggression in animals.
The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs are provided with the minimum amount of floor space in order to avoid
overcrowding and to support the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
