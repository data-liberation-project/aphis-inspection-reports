3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In multiple enclosures there were visible broken wires at the base of the rear and center mesh divider panels.
These enclosures must be maintained in good repair for the health and safety of the animals.
In one enclosure housing two (2) Dachshunds there were zip ties that had been cut sharply and were protruding up
into the enclosure through the mesh floor panel. This could possibly be a safety hazard to the dogs and should be
addressed.
One enclosure had a portion of the interior wooden door frame that was scratched and chewed to the point it was
no longer impervious to moisture. Surfaces must be maintained to keep the enclosure in good repair.
