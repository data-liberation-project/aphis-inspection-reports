SANITATION.
The layer of newspaper lining the bottom of the chinchilla enclosure was completely wetted with what appeared to
be urine with/without water and a moderate amount of feces covering the papered area. Some chinchilla feces
were present on the floor extending to about a foot outside of the enclosure. There was also a noticeable ammonia
odor in the room.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards from
pathogen buildup in feces and reduce odors which can contribute to discomfort or illness in animals.
