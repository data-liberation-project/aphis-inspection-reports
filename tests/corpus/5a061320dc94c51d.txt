2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On the afternoon of 27 April 2014, a member of the public was allowed to hold a bear cub and have direct contact
with an adult bobcat at the facility. Per the licensee, the bear cub is one of two cubs 14-15 weeks old and weighing
between 18-22 pounds. While holding the bear cub in her arms a patron sustained a bite from the bear cub which
broke skin and drew blood. Although the licensee insisted that he did not recall the details of this incident, he did
state that during the last couple weeks he knows of at least 2 incidents in which the bear cubs had nipped
volunteers and/or visiting public while being handled. If a member of the public is injured by an animal there may
be a risk of disease transmission or infection, which could be harmful to the victim and the animal. During public
exhibition of an animal it must be handled in such a way that there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public. To insure the safety of the animals and visiting public, it is the responsibility of the licensee to have trained
staff present and in direct control of the animals, in addition to understanding when the behavior of the animal may
make it innappropriate and unsafe to allow public exhibition without sufficient barriers.
Correct for any and all future public exibitions.
Exit interview conducted with licensee.
