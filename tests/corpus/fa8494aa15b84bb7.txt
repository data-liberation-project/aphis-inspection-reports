3.31(a)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs in rows 1, 2, and 3 are still not being cleaned adequately or often enough to
remove accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding. A total of 86 out of 89 enlosures in rows 1, 2. and 3 have
accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding. More fecal material was visible than bedding material. Owner stated
that rows 2 and 3 were cleaned about two weeks ago and row 1 had not been cleaned in three weeks. The cleaning
process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this accumulation inside the enclosures.
Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and
viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and soiled
bedding and must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept
clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and soiled bedding.
Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(4) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Owner stated during the inspection that they have not started a sanitation program yet. Lack of a sanitation program
exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures
must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or as necessary with proper agents to sufficiently disinfect all
surfaces that the guinea pigs may come into contact. Sanitation of primary enclosures is necessary to minimize risk
of disease to the animals housed therein. Correct by ensuring a sanitation program is put into effect.

3.32 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The facility does not appear to have a sufficient number of employees to adequately care for the number of guinea
pigs being housed and to keep up with the general conditions in the facility.This facility has been cited previously for
inadequate cleaning and sanitation. Guinea pig enclosures in rows 1, 2, and 3 have not been cleaned in two ormore weeks and enclosures have accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding. A sanitation program has not been
implemented since the last inspecton. Insufficient employees allows cleaning and sanitation to fall behind, and these
conditions can pose health risks to the animals. Correct by ensuring that an adequate number of employees are
present to adequately care for the guinea pigs and to maintain a level of cleanliness in the facility that is appropriate
for good animal health and husbandry.
Remains uncorrected
Exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
