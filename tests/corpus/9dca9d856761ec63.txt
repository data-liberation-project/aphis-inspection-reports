ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care indicates that all animals will have fecals checked at least once per year.
The last fecal done for any of the animals was for hoof stock in September 2018. All animals are now overdue for
fecals at the frequency dictated by the program of veterinary care. Fecals must be done for these animals to
prevent, control and diagnose any potential internal parasite issues. It is important to follow the attending
veterinarians instructions to ensure that the animals remain healthy.
