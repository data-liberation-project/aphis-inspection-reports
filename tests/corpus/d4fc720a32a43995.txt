2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1415 on
26-Sep-19. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. The person that answered the door informed
me that the licensee would not be home anytime soon. I told him I would try back another time.
End of report.
