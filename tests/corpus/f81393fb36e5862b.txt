FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The facility has been housing a cat in an enclosure in the hay and bedding area. Housing the cat in this area
does not protect the hay and bedding supplies from potential contamination. For the health of the animals and to
protect the food supplies, the cat needs to be housed in another area.
