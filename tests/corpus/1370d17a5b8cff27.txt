Facilities, general.
On the morning of September 2, 2021, it was discovered that one of two co-housed, male, pallid bats was missing from
an enclosure. Both males were observed in the enclosure the day prior and were together in the enclosure for six days
without incident prior to the discovery. The species is one that that occurs on campus and in nearby areas and was
captured at a nearby grove; it was in an acclimation phase following capture, without having been used in any
experiments. After a thorough search of the primary enclosure and items within it and the housing room, anteroom and
entire animal holding facility (including within ceiling and air duct spaces), it was determined that the bat likely escaped
through a very small gap in the primary enclosure at the point where the tray bottom was located, which staff initially
deemed too small to allow escape. The gap has since been eliminated. The bat might then have escaped beneath the
anteroom and main facility doors, which have since been modified to close any potential gap sites.
The registrant must ensure that enclosures and housing facilities are constructed of such material and of such strength as
appropriate for the animals involved; they must be sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals.
CORRECTED BEFORE THE TIME OF INSPECTION.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with an IACUC representative.
