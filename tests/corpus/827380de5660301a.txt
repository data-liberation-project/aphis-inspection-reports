2.31(c)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A review of institutional records indicate that no semi-annual inspection of the Stahl Farm facility had occurred since
June 02, 2016. The most recent IACUC semi-annual inspection report, dated January 06, 2017 and submitted to
the IO on January 09, 2017, stated that during its semi-annual review of the institutional animal care and use
program and facilities inspection, the Stahl Farm was not inspected since there were no animals currently on study
at the site.
A review of animal health records showed research cattle were last housed at the Stahl Farm facility on April 04,
2016. Discussion with research facility representatives during the inspection indicated that the Stahl Farm was still
an active research animal site and would continue to house research cattle as research studies necessitate.
Failure to conduct semi-annual facility site inspections are not in compliance with 9 CFR 2.31 (c) 2. The failure to
conduct semi-annual research animal facility site inspections may hinder the ability of institutional officials to identify
problems and take needed corrective actions to prevent animal facilities and animal study areas from falling into
disrepair and non-compliance.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the facility's
research animal facilities, including animal study areas.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the institutional chief compliance officer and another facility
representative.
