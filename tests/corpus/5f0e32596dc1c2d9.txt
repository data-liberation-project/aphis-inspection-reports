3.80(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The ringtail lemur enclosure (indoor portion) on the left wall when entering the lemur room is in need of repair. The
enclosure had a piece of wire mesh attached to it covering an approximately 2x4 inch opening constructed in the
enclosure to allow food to be placed inside the enclosure. The piece of wire mesh that was supposed to cover the
opening was noted instead dangling from just one secured point on the upper left corner. This left the opening exposed. A
lemur may injure itself or get a body part caught in the opening. Primary enclosures for non-human primates must be
structurally sound and kept in good repair. Correct by 1/27/23.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
