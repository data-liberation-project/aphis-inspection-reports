2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs had veterinary care issues in which the Attending Veterinarian had not been contacted prior to inspection.
A black female Shar Pei (#5) had a laceration that was approximately three inches in length on the left side of the
face. The licensee is not sure how the injury happened. Untreated wounds can be painful and become infected.
A brown female Shar Pei (#002) had a small amount of discharge coming from both eyes. Upon examination, it
appeared both eyes were irritating her as she was having problems opening her eyes. In addition, the left eye was
clouded over. Eye problems can indicate underlying health issues, can be painful, or may spread to other animals.
The Attending Veterinarian needs to be contacted and both dogs needs to be treated per his/her instructions.

End of report.
