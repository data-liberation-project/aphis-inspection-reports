ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female, black and white, adult Shih tzu (0A02043442, "Julias Patsy Lynn") has a sore between its toes on the
right front foot.The sore is mostly hairless, reddened and moist. The fur surrounding the sore is wet from the dog
licking at it. The licensee stated that she had not noticed it before. At the time of inspection the licensee began to
treat the sore in accordance with the facility's program of veterinary care.
A female, white, adult American Eskimo Dog (0A02041764, "Nelson's Cosmoe") has a thick buildup of tarter on its
teeth. The dog is approximately seven years old. The grayish-brown colored material is covering the surface of the
dog's cheek teeth on both sides. The gums are also reddened with a grayish creamy discharge along the gum-line
on the upper left side.
The dog's teeth have not been evaluated by a veterinarian. Dental problems can be painful and affect the health of
the animal. The abnormal buildup of material on the teeth can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally. The
licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. The
outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An outdoor enclosure located on the southeast side, has a welded wire panel on the front end that allows two adult
Golden Retrievers to push their head and neck through the openings. The potential for injury or death exists if the
dogs get their head or other part of their body stuck in the openings.
Housing facilities for the dogs must be designed and constructed so they protect the animals from injury, contain the
animals securely and restrict other animals from entering. The licensee must alter the wire panel in a manner that
does not allow the dogs to stick their heads and necks through any openings. The licensee must ensure that the
enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.3.1(c)(1)(ii) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A southeast enclosure containing two adult Golden Retrievers, has a sharp wire point located near the northwest
corner fastened to a metal t-post. The sharp wire is located at a height where the dogs can come in contact with it.
The wire is approximately an inch long.
An enclosure containing two adult Bichons has broken wire fencing along the bottom left edge where the dogs can
come in contact with it. The licensee moved the Bichons to a different enclosure free of sharp points at the time of
inspection.
Housing facilities for dogs must be free of sharp points and jagged edges that could injure the animals. The licensee
must remove the sharp points from the dog enclosures in order to eliminate the injury risk towards the dogs. The
licensee must also ensure that all housing facilities remain safe for the dogs at all times.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two outdoor housing areas located on the southeast side have two shelters with damaged wind and rain breaks.
The flaps being used on the entrance of the shelters have been excessively chewed and the material is beginning to
fray. There are also areas where the flaps have been torn off and are missing.
As a result, there are large openings in the front of the shelters that do not provide three adult Golden Retrievers
with adequate protection from adverse weather conditions. Lack of wind and rain breaks does not ensure protection
from the direct effect of wind, rain and snow. The licensee must repair or replace the damaged wind and rain
breaks.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The east side enclosure containing two adult Golden Retrievers, has a buildup of old and fresh feces. The licensee
stated that the last time the feces were removed from the enclosure was in April. The buildup of feces could
increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily in order to prevent soiling of the dogs, and
to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. The licensee must remove the feces from this enclosure and
ensure that excreta is removed from all enclosures daily. 3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The southeast outdoor enclosure containing two Golden retrievers, has a thick buildup of dirt and grime on the
interior walls and floor of the shelter. The buildup of dirt and grime could increase the risk of disease towards the
dogs.
Used primary enclosures for dogs must be sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more often if necessary to
prevent the buildup of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The licensee must remove the
buildup of dirt from the interior surfaces of the shelter. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain free of the
buildup of dirt and grime in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
