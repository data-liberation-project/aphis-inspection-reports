3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The following areas of perimeter and enclosure fencing are in need of repair.
* Near the walking path, a section of perimeter fencing has become detached and is extending inwards. In
addition, another section of perimeter fencing near the walking path is loose and needs to be reattached to make
the fencing secure.
* There are two separate areas in the perimeter fencing next to the walking path where there is an estimated six
inch gap between the perimeter fencing and the ground below.
* The enclosure fencing used to contain seven goats has one area where the fencing has become detached
creating an estimated four to six inch gap at the bottom. The fencing is extending inwards towards the goats.
The gaps created by the detached perimeter fencing and the area between the perimeter fence and the ground
below do not restrict animals and unauthorized persons from gaining contact to the animals in the facility. The
facility must have in place an effective and customary containment with security measures for the animals in the
facility. The licensee must establish and adhere to a method of fence maintenance to ensure that all fencing
securely contains the animals within and prevents unauthorized persons or animals from entering or having contact
with the animals.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 8/2/16 were conducted with the Director, Animal Care
Supervisor, Angela DePoe ACI and Robert Bacon ACI.
* Exit briefing done on 8/3/16 were conducted with the Director, Animal Care Supervisor and Robert Bacon ACI.
