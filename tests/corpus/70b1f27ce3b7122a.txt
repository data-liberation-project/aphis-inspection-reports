2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
(b) Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include:
(2) The use of appropriate methods:
***In the whelping facility, there was an adult female English Bulldog identified as Marlee #075-856-785 that had a
thick yellowish matter covering approximately half of the left eye and a third of the right eye. A darker brown, crusty
substance was stuck in the top eyelashes of both eyes. The dog was observed rubbing her eyes on the gate of the
enclosure. This dog whelped on 9/2/14 and that is when the condition began according to the facility representative,
treatment for this dog had been started at that time and instructions were written for general eye issues by the
veterinarian in the medical log book. Upon review of the medical instructions, it stated to use medication for
non-specific eye injuries or conditions and have vet check if not improved in 48 hours. The facility representative
stated that this is normal presentation for this animal each time she has puppies and it goes away with treatment. A
veterinarian had not been contacted concerning the continuation of the eye discharge. Eye discharge can occur due
to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The licensee must contact a
licensed veterinarian to ensure appropriate treatment is provided for the continuation of this condition and assure
adequate veterinary care is provided as required.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces--(3) Cleaning.
***In the sheltered facilities, there were at least eight hinged doors and doorways that had a buildup of dirt and
grime. There were two enclosures that had not contained dogs for approximately three weeks. These two
enclosures had not been cleaned and were next to an enclosure containing two weaned puppies. The doorways,
doors, corners, floors and walls had a buildup of dirt and grime. Cleaning of hard surfaces is essential for a healthy
environment and reduces disease hazards by eliminating harboring places for diseases and pests. The licensee
must assure that all surfaces in contact with the animals are spot cleaned daily and sanitized every two weeks ormore often as required.
To be corrected by September 24, 2014.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
(b) Food receptacles
***In the sheltered facilities, there were at least nine food receptacles that had been chewed around the edges and
had a buildup of food, dirt and grime stuck to them. The buildup of waste materials in and on the food receptacles
increases the risks of disease hazards to the animals by providing a harboring place for diseases and pests. The
licensee must clean or replace these food receptacles and assure that all food receptacles are cleaned and
sanitized as required.
To be corrected by September 24, 2014.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(d) Pest control.
***In and around the two adult sheltered facilities, there was a large amount of flies. In the middle sheltered facility
mice droppings were observed behind the food and trash barrels and ants on the tile ledge. The facility
representative stated that fly spray is used in the adult buildings according to the veterinarians instructions. Pests
carry diseases which increases the risks of contamination to the dogs, water and food supply. The licensee must
ensure that measures are taken to control pests in the facility and assure that an effective pest control program is
provided as required.
