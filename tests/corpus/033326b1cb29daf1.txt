3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
In an elevated enclosure housing two pigs, the floor grates are displaced. The front grate is pushed forward, leaving a gap
in the floor that is approximately 2 feet wide that spans across half of the pen. The two locking mechanisms meant to
keep the flooring in place are not engaged.
Unstable or unsecured flooring can lead to injury or escape. All enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. The facility fixed the flooring at the time of
inspection.

This inspection was conducted from 11/1/22 to 11/3/22 and the exit interview was conducted on 11/3/22 with facility
representatives.
