Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Two protocols IACUC approved protocols under the same Principal Investigator require multiple caesarian sections in
female baboons. According to both protocols, A005 and B001, multiple experimental protocols/surgeries will be carried
out on each baboon over a 3-year period. Female baboons under these protocols would receive a maximum of 4 survival
caesarian sections during the 3-year duration of the protocol. The protocols indicate animals will be undergoing multiple
major surgeries to reduce animal numbers but did not provide a scientific justification nor have approval from the
Administrator. At the time of inspection, the facility has not sought or received approval from the Administrator for any of
the animals that have undergone multiple major operative procedures on these protocols.

No animal will be used in more than one major operative procedure from which it is allowed to recover, unless justified for
scientific reasons in writing by the principal investigator, require veterinary care and treatment, and/or in special
circumstances as determined by the Administrator on individual basis.

Primary enclosures.
On the morning of 10/22/2021, a male rhesus macaque (RA0952) was observed outside his primary enclosure moving
around on the top of enclosures in the room. According to facility representatives, the macaque escaped overnight after
animal care staff completed evening rounds. The bottom lock used to secure the guillotine door was not completely
latched allowing the macaque to escape. During the time of escape, the macaque (RA0952) sustained an injury from
another macaque housed in the room. According to internal records, the male macaque RA0952 extended his tongue in
front of the other macaque. The other macaque bit off the tongue of macaque RA0952 approximately 1 cm rostral to the
frenulum.

The macaque RA0952 was sedated and assessed by a clinical veterinarian. The macaque received adequate veterinary
care.

Primary enclosures must be constructed to contain nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the
enclosure, including opening by the animal.

This was corrected at the time of inspection through a complete change of enclosure for the macaque and retraining the
animal care staff.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

This inspection was conducted November 17, 2021 - November 22, 2021.
