PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A number of the portable kennels used to house the dogs within the travel trailer were soiled. The fronts of multiple
cages were rusty. One cage was damaged near the top, with portions of the plastic missing.
Rust present on the doors prevents proper sanitation. Housing the dogs in enclosures in these conditions can cause
spread of disease.
A system of cleaning and maintenance must be in place to keep the primary enclosures of dogs clean and in good
repair.

WATERING.
The water bowls in the outdoor enclosures had scale in them. One of the bowls had a dark green film under the
level of the water. The dogs within the portable kennels in the trailer did not have water present at the time of the
inspection.
Provision of clean, potable water is essential to maintaining the health of the animals. A system of maintaining the water bowl and provision of clean, potable water must be established.
Correct from this date forward.
