Focused Inspection on Marine Mammals.
No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.
An exit interview was completed with the facility representatives.
Note: The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” and "received by" date on this inspection report are different than the date the inspector
prepared and delivered the original inspection report, which both occurred on 8/19/16.
