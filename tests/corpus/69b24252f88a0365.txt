ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:25 AM on
16-MAR-17.
Left messages on both cell phones at 11:30 AM. Approximately 5 minutes later, while waiting in the owners
driveway, I received a text that the owners were at a funeral. The text stated that they would not be home until
tonight.
