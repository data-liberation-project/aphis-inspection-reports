3.25(a)

Facilities, general.
During the inspection, there was one guinea pig observed outside of its enclosure and running around on the floor of the
facility.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
