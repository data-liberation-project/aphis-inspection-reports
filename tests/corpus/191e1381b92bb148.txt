2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
During a review of animal disposition records, it was observed that the last euthanasia of an inventory/stock animal was
dated 12/3/2020. Facility personnel stated that animals had been euthanized since then but the record of these
euthanasias could not be located.

Dealers are required to maintain records which accurately disclose acquisition and disposition information of all covered
animals under their control, which includes recording all animals euthanized. Failure to maintain these records can inhibit
animal tracking as well as prevent an accurate accounting of covered animals. Correct by documenting the species,
number of animals, and date of each animal euthanasia. Correct by May 29, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
