INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) has not completed a semi-annual review of its program
for humane care and use of animals since 9/16/16.
The semiannual review is necessary in order to ensure compliance with animal welfare laws and regulations.
Failure to conduct reviews of its program at least once every six month could lead to deficiencies in animal welfare
safeguards. The IACUC should complete a semiannual review of its program and submit a report to the Institutional
Official by 6/17/17.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative on 5/17/17.
