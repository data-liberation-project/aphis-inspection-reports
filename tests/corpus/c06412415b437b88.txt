2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female American Bulldog (tattoo #49) has a round growth on her right hind leg. The abnormal growth is located on
the upper portion of the leg and is approximately the size of a ping pong ball. Physical examination of the growth
revealed that it felt soft and pliable but maintained the round shape. The skin in the affected area was slightly
reddened.
Female Olde English Bulldog (tattoo #06) was seen holding her left front foot off the floor of the enclosure and she
walked with a slight limp. Closer examination revealed a red growth located on the bottom of her left front foot and
between the toes. There was a small hole in the surface of the growth. This dog also has a discharge coming from
both eyes. The discharge from the right eye has a yellowish color and was located near the bottom inside corner of
the eye. The hair around the bottom and top of this eye has a brown, dried material stuck to it. The discharge
around the right eye is light grey in color and is coating the hair around the outside corner of the eye.
Abnormal growths and poor eye health can cause pain and discomfort to the dog. The above mentioned dogs must
be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to establish a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. The diagnosis
and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Corbin Ranslem, ACI and the facility
representatives.
