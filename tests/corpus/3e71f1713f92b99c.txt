Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of the inspection, neither the licensee nor the facility representatives could present any records of acquisition
or disposition. Since the last inspection, one adult female marmoset, one adult male marmoset and two adult guinea pigs
are no longer present; the licensee reported (through her authorized representative, one of her employees) that the
marmosets went home with her to live with the licensee permanently.
Also since the last inspection, there are three new baby raccoons and one new adult male fox that a representative stated
came from the state Fish and Wildlife department, but no acquisition records were produced upon request.
Records containing the required information for animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including
those offspring born on premises, are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use. The
licensee shall make, keep and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully and correctly
disclose the required information.
3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
In the outdoor portion of the enclosure containing one adult male African green monkey, there are heavy accumulations of
bird excreta on the low hanging foliage of the trees, the dirt and cement floor, and enrichment items.


Soiled surfaces that are not or cannot be adequately cleaned can harbor harmful microbes and encourage microbial
growth, attract pests and vermin, and can lead to animal illness. The licensee must ensure that surfaces with which non-
human primates come in contact are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Section 3.84 of the Animal
Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards; floors made of dirt,
absorbent bedding, sand, gravel, grass or other similar material, and planted enclosures must be raked or spot cleaned.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the building housing the commissary and the indoor portions of the enclosures housing three adult female lemurs, one
adult male African green monkey and one adult male capuchin monkey, mouse feces are seen on and within a collection
of unused totes/cages and other discarded materials on the floor just in front of the African green monkey enclosure.
Accumulations of trash or discarded items can attract and harbor rodents, insects and other vermin that can cause injury
or illness to the animals. The licensee must ensure that all premises where housing facilities are located, including
buildings and surrounding grounds, are kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the nonhuman primates from
injury or illness, facilitate good husbandry practices, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents,
pests, and vermin. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste and discarded matter.
3.84(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the building which houses the commissary and the indoor portions of the enclosures housing three adult female lemurs,
one adult male African green monkey and one adult male capuchin monkey, mouse feces are seen on and within a
collection of unused totes/cages and other discarded materials on the floor just in front of the African green monkey
enclosure. Additional accumulations of mouse feces are noted on boxes containing enrichment toys in the commissary


area. In the outdoor portion of the enclosure containing one adult male African green monkey, there are heavy
accumulations of bird excreta on the low hanging foliage of the trees, the dirt and cement floor, and enrichment items.
There are accumulations of dead flies on the windowsill nearest the indoor portion of the capuchin enclosure, and dozens
of flies are swarming the commissary area and landing on food prep surfaces and utensils.
Pests and vermin can contaminate food and water and injure or spread disease to the non-human primates. The licensee
must establish and maintain an effective program of control of insects, external parasites affecting nonhuman primates,
and birds and mammals that are pests, so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in animal areas.

Watering.
In the pen containing two adult male gray foxes, the interior of the water receptacle is covered in algae; the water is
diffusely green and murky, with feathers and other debris in the water. When asked about the frequency of sanitation for
cleaning water receptacles and replacing with fresh water, a caretaker stated that they try to do it as often as needed, but
that it looked to her as though it had not been done in a while.
Watering receptacles that are not regularly cleaned can cause animals' drinking water to become contaminated or
unpalatable, leading to illness. The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.
3.131 Repeat

Sanitation.
In the building which houses the commissary, one young pig, three baby raccoons, two kinkajou, one adult chinchilla,
three adult ground squirrels and two flying squirrels, there are accumulations of mouse feces on boxes containing
enrichment toys and accumulations of dead flies on the windowsills. Additional mouse feces are seen on and within a


collection of unused totes/cages and other discarded materials on the floor. There are dead flies and crusty debris on the
inside of the freezer used to store food for some of the animals. Dozens of flies are swarming the commissary area and
landing on food prep surfaces and utensils. Accumulations of trash or discarded items can attract and harbor rodents,
insects and other vermin that can cause injury or illness to the animals. Pests and vermin can contaminate food and
injure or spread disease to the animals.
The licensee must ensure that premises (buildings and grounds) are kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the
animals from injury and illness, and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall be
placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary and a safe and effective program for the control of insects,
ectoparasites and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained to protect the health of the animals.
