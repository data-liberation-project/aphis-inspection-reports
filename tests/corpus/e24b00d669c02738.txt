ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee did not have a written program of veterinary care. The licensee has had a veterinarian do site visits,
but had not made formal arrangements including a written program of veterinary care.
The lack of guidance for appropriate methods to maintain the health of the dogs can cause preventable injury or
disease to happen and/or the wrong treatment and care for the animal when something does occur. The licensee
must make formal arrangements with an appropriate and knowledgeable veterinarian which includes a written
program of veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Schnauzer (microchip # 010833006) had a large mass behind the right elbow of the front leg. The mass
was approximately four inches in diameter, soft/giving to the touch, with little hair, and was movable underneath the
skin. The licensee stated he noticed it after she was bred and believes it is a "normal fatty tumor" caused by (cid:28)her
"getting older", but has not had it diagnosed by a veterinarian.
Masses can cause pulling on the skin, which can be painful, and be symptoms/results of many ailments. The
license must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is
obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information including the diagnosis,
treatment, and resolution of the condition must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.In the "main building" there were 2 enclosures housing a total of 2 dogs and in the "big dog" building there was 1
enclosure housing 1 dog that did not meet the minimum space requirements. The dogs were "Annie" a female
cream Standard Poodle about 1 year of age, "Clyde" a male Golden Retriever about 7 years of age, and "Lucile" a
cream Goldendoodle about 3 years of age. All the dogs were at least 29 inches, or larger, from tip of nose to base
of tail requiring a minimum of 8.51 square feet of space. The enclosures were 28 inches by 42 inches equating to
8.17 square feet of space.
The lack of space can cause the inability to posture normally and affect the growth of young animals. The applicant
must provide the minimum space required by measuring the dog from tip of nose to base of tail, adding six inches,
squaring, and dividing by 144 to get the required minimum space in square feet. The licensee must also ensure that
the height of the primary enclosure be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure
when it is in a normal standing position.

EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The licensee did not have a documented exercise plan. Dogs were housed as individuals, and in compatible
groups. Space equivalent to allowed exercise standards was present for most dogs, however there were some
dogs in minimum space or less that received turn out, when the weather was favorable.
The lack of appropriate exercise can affect the dogs' mental and physical health, and impact the growth of young
dogs. The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for exercise. In addition, the plan must
be approved by the attending veterinarian, and made available for APHIS upon request.
