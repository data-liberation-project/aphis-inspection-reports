2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The tiger known as JJ was euthanized since the time of the last inspection. JJ was euthanized by .410 gunshot
(slug) to the head by the licensee. There was no sedation, tranquilization or anesthesia used prior to the gunshot.
The program of veterinary care states that the licensee can perform euthanasia on instruction by the veterinarian
but it also states that euthanasia must be done in compliance with AVMA guidelines. The AVMA guidelines state
that gunshot can be done if no other method of euthanasia is available. As this was not an emergency situation,
other methods of euthanasia were available. The licensee had ample time to sedate, tranquilize or anesthetize the
animal prior to shooting it. The licensee stated that the veterinarian told him it was fine to just shoot the animal.
The only written directions available for APHIS review was the PVC and a copy of the AVMA guidelines. Except for
in cases of extreme emergency, the animal must be heavily sedated, tranquilized or under anesthesia prior to
gunshot euthanasia.
This was a focused inspection to check on the condition of the lemurs and the tiger known as Daisy cited on the
inspection of 5-17-16. When the inspectors inquired about the condition of the tiger known as JJ they were told of
the euthanasia.
