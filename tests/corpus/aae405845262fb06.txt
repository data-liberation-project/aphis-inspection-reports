2.40(a)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During inspection, there was a female degu (born April 2017) that was lateral (unable to sit upright) in its enclosure. The
licensee euthanized the degu without consulting the Attending Veterinarian. The program of veterinary care lists six
different situations in which an animal can be euthanized by the licensee, but this is not one of those situations.
Euthanizing an animal for a reason that has not been authorized in the program of veterinary care and not contacting the
Attending Veterinarian to get approval to euthanize the animal doesn't ensure the Attending Veterinarian has the
appropriate authority to ensure that adequate veterinary care is being given to all the animals. The Attending Veterinarian
must be contacted prior to euthanasia for any situations that are not authorized in the Program of Veterinary Care.
Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
