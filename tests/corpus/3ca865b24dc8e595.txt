2.126(b)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:50 a.m. on
August 11th, 2022. I spoke to a Facility Representative, but she was not authorized to do an inspection. She wasn't sure
if the licensee was around. I knocked on the door, but no one answered. I honked the car horn, but no one else
responded. I contacted the licensee by phone and he informed me no one authorized to do the inspection would be
around anytime soon.

End of report.
