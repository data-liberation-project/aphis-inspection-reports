Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process from 2:05 pm to 2:39
pm on 04-JAN-23. There was no answer at the house or the kennel. I called and left a message to licensee's work
phone. Receiving no responses, I left the facility at 2:39 pm.
