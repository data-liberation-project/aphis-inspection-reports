3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, the following animals had recently arrived at the KLM cargo office on flight 605 from
Amsterdam:
A dog on waybill number 074-24482883, and a dog on waybill # 074-25030250.
The dog on waybill # 074-24482883 did not have a shipper's certification regarding the last time food and water had
been offered attached to the crate.
At the time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment the carrier must ensure that the consignor provides certification in
writing regarding feeding and watering instructions, and the last time food and water was offered. Failure to provide
this information could put the animal at risk. This information should be clearly displayed on the carrier, during
transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order to help ensure that
animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
3.14(a)(6) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At the time of inspection, the following animals had recently arrived at the KLM cargo office on flight 605 from
Amsterdam:
A dog on waybill number 074-24482883, and a dog on waybill # 074-25030250.
Neither crate had the words "LIVE ANMALS" on the top side in letters at least one inch in height.
Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it should be clearly marked on top and on one or
more sides with the words ``LIVE ANIMALS", in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high to help ensure proper handlingby transportation personnel.
Failure to properly label crates used to ship live animals could result in mishandling by transport personnel, which
could be injurious to the animals.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
At the time of inspection, the following animals had recently arrived at the KLM cargo office on flight 605 from
Amsterdam:
A dog on waybill number 074-24482883, and a dog on waybill # 074-25030250.
Each crate contained only one receptacle that could hold food or water.
Food and water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the
receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosure without opening the door. Failure to provide a food and a water
receptacle could result in inadequate feeding and/or watering, which could be detrimental to the animal.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with representatives for KLM at the cargo office.
