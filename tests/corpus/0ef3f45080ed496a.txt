****Three of the reindeer have large areas of hair loss along their flanks. One of the animals had a smaller area
within the hairless area that appeared red and inflamed. The licensee needs to establish a consistent method for
daily observation of the health and well-being of the animals and more timely communication with the attending
veterinarian when there are problems with animal health. The veterinarian needs to be contacted and this hair loss
problem addressed as soon as possible.
To be corrected immediately.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee.
