2.33(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Facility personnel did not perform adequate daily observations of a 12 year old, buckskin mare, ID #05, used on a
teaching protocol, by failing to observe and report the worsening condition of the animal’s left eye to the
veterinarian.
During an inspection on June 6, APHIS inspectors observed a mare with a small injury to the lower left eyelid. The
tissue surrounding the eye was swollen and the eye was tearing continuously. Inspectors observed the mare for
approximately 15 minutes, during which time she predominantly held the eyelid partially or fully closed. The mare
was able to open the eyelid, and inspectors observed that the eye was cloudy. The clinical veterinarian verbally
informed APHIS inspectors that she observed the swollen eye on Friday, June 1, when the mare arrived. Daily
observations had already been performed by facility staff before the inspectors arrived. The veterinarian stated that
the eye appeared to have worsened since she had initially seen it, but facility staff had not notified her of the horse’s
condition. After the inspection, a veterinarian examined the mare and initiated treatment for the eye.
Adequate daily observation of all animals is critical to ensure that conditions that can adversely affect health and
well-being are recognized and conveyed to a facility veterinarian in a timely manner so that appropriate methods
can be employed to ensure proper care.
Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily
observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being; provided, however, that daily observation of
animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian; and provided further, that a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
This inspection was conducted from June 5-7 with facility representatives and the exit interview was conducted on
June 8 with facility representatives.Additional Inspectors
