2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facilities' records required by the AWA, specifically the written Program of Veterinary Care, disposition of
animals records and animal inventory records, were not available at the time of inspection. Unavailability of records
does not allow APHIS Officials to review the Program of Veterinary Care and evaluate whether the facility is
following the program to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care. It also does not allow tracking of animals
as needed. Maintain records as required by the AWA and ensure they are available at all times for review. Correct
