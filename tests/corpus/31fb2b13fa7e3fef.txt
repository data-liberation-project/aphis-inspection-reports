ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a 7yr old female Pug (Joyce) that has several missing and loose teeth with receding red gums, and brown
tarter buildup on her left front canine. This left canine has the entire root exposed. There has not been any
veterinary care provided for the animal at this time. Her weight and condition appeared good, however her teeth
need to be attended to.
Loose teeth and receded gums can be a sign of gum disease and be a source of pain and discomfort for the animal
which can cause other possible health issues if left untreated.
The licensee must have the attending veterinarian properly diagnose and treat any regulated animals with tooth or
mouth issues, and have this dog seen.

2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are four litters of puppies that do not have complete puppy card information including their puppy ID numbers
for the 2 litters without the female. The other two litters do not have any cage card identifying the female, DOB or
number of puppies.
Complete records are important for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
The licensee must fill out cage cards with all of the required information and have them on the cages with litters.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 10 middle panels between dog cages with chewed plastic coating on over 80% of the wires that have not
been repaired or replaced on the inside portion of the kennel.This issue can cause these surfaces to be
unsanitizable as bacteria can remain in the edges of the chewed plastic.
Chewed plastic surfaces can be a possible source of disease where bacteria and viruses can reside.
The licensee must repair or replace the middle panels and floors with chewed plastic coating on the wires, to
provide a smooth sanitizable surface.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
On 12 of the enclosures the outside wall around the flap door in the outdoor run area has a buildup of black/brown
dirt/grime including 6 of the outside surfaces on the outside of the door flaps. While the cages are very clean, these
wall surfaces are difficult to reach and are only being cleaned with a power washer, when a brush should be taken
to the walls in this area more often to remove stubborn dirt/grime.
The buildup of dirt/grime on wall and door flaps can be a possible source of disease where bacteria can reside
The walls, feeders and door flaps must be cleaned well enough to remove dirt/grime to provide santizable surfaces
as often as necessary to prevent this buildup.
