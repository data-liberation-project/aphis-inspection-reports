ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The squirrel monkey has a significant hair loss along the backside of the tail from the base of the body to the tip
of the tail. The facility has noticed that the animal is rubbing its food along the tail more often which could contribute
to this hair loss. The facility has not communicated this loss of hair to the vet or documented any daily observations
to track this behavior. This animal should be evaluated by a vet that has experience with non human primates to
diagnose and treat the animal.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The main building housing the non human primates and other exotics needs to be addressed. There are
miscellaneous items stored above animal enclosures (crates, plastic items, bags etc). Additionally there is a lot of
cobwebs and dust up in the sky lights that needs to be cleaned. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of
trash, junk, waste, and discarded matter. This area needs to be addressed to facilitate cleaning and promote good
housekeeping practices.
