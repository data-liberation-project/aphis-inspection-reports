ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 PM on
09/09/2015.
Spoke with the zookeeper by cell phone. She was unable to come to the facility for an inspection, but did give me
her days and hours of availability.
