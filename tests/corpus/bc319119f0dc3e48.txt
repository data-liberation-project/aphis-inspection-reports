FACILITIES, INDOOR.
(b) Ventilation.
During this inspection, the animal room had a strong ammonia odor permeating the air. The air conditioner, which
is utilized for this room was not present in its normal location. According to the facility representatives, the air
conditioner was removed for cleaning and would be replaced. However, while the air conditioner was out of
commission, an alternative method of ventilation should have be provided to help reduce the odor within the room.
Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs or hamsters shall be adequately ventilated to provide for the health and
comfort of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be provided with fresh air either by means of windows, doors,
vents, or air conditioning, and shall be ventilated so as to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture condensation.
