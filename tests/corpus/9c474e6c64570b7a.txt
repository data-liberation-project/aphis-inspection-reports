2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was found to be incomplete and missing information on appropriate
methods to deliver adequate veterinary care. The licensee's written PVC must include and establish regularly
scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian (AV). Also, the veterinary methods to deliver adequate veterinary
care to animals were generic and unspecific. In order to provide adequate veterinary care to regulated animals, the
licensee and the AV should review and update the PVC by listing specific and detailed information on all preventive,
diagnose and treatment methods for all species.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two of eleven performing dogs inspected, exhibited significant redness and some bleeding at their gums. Also,
many teeth at their upper jaws showed gritty material and increased yellow stains. The use of appropriate methods
to prevent, control, diagnoses, and treat diseases and injuries in regulated animals is paramount to provide
adequate veterinary care. The licensee must consult the attending veterinarian and seek veterinary dental care for
the affected dogs as soon as possible.
