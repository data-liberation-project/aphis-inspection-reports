3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Three Prairie Dogs were observed outside of their primary enclosure and in an unused fenced area within the park.
The primary enclosure had originally housed five adult Prairie Dogs. The facility representative stated that a couple
weeks prior to the inspection all of the animals escaped from their enclosure through buried mesh wire. Two of the
Prairie Dogs were captured and placed in another enclosure to secure them while their primary enclosure was being
repaired. The facility representative has made a plan for capture of these animals as well as for a future enclosure
which would prevent the escape of these animals. For the three Prairie Dogs safety, they must be captured and
contained within a safe and secure enclosure.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals.
