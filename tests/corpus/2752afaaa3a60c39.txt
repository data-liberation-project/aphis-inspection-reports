Having ear issues can be painful and irritating to the dog. This cause the dog to scratch, bite or rub the ears and
may result in wounds/sores on the ears. Licensee must have methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat all
ear issues. These two dogs must be seen by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of the examination,
diagnoses and treatment must maintained by the licensee and made available for inspection by APHIS officials.

Two dogs were noticed to have ear issues at today(cid:25)s inspection. In addition, several other dogs were noticed to be
shaking their heads but had no obvious signs of ear issues. Licensee's wife stated that these issues had not been
noticed prior to today's inspection. Issues that are left unnoticed and untreated can cause the animal's unnecessary
pain and discomfort. Licensee must have a routine for daily observation and communicate all health issues to the
attending veterinarian within a timely manor.
