2.126(a) CRITICAL
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
On March 22, 2018 at 215 pm, the licensee refused to allow APHS inspectors to complete an animal welfare
inspection. The licensee stated that he was too busy with his job (located on same property as the licensed facility)
to leave and complete an inspection. He stated that he had not made any changes since the last inspection. His
wife was also present on this day but stated that she was too busy caring for the children in the house to
accompany inspectors for an inspection. Failure to allow for unannounced animal welfare inspections makes it
impossible for APHIS to determine if the facility is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations.
Correct this by allowing APHIS officials access to the facility for all future unannounced inspections.
Correct for all future inspections
