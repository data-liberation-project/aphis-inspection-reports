3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
There were 6 enclosures housing guinea pig weanlings without the required floor space. Enclosures measure 21.5 inches
by 33.5 inches or 720.25 square inches of floor space. Weanling guinea pigs weighting up to 350 grams require at least
60 inches of floor space per animal. Lack of floor space can increase stress, fighting, and disease risks. Can not house
more than 12 weanlings in this size enclosure. Three enclosures had 16 weanlings, 1 enclosure had 15 weanlings, and
two enclosures had 13 weanlings present. Licensee must ensure that the required floor space per guinea pig is provided.
