Sanitation.
There was a heavy accumulation of rodent feces spread across the back portion of the floor of a food storage shed for
hoof stock. During closer inspection of this area, a rat was seen running across the floor in this area. Additionally, there
was an open sack of hay pellets in the shed. The licensee stated there is a pest control program in place for rodents
including traps; however, there were no traps seen in the shed during this inspection. Pests and vermin may contaminate
food as well as harbor and spread diseases. A safe and effective pest control program must be established and
maintained to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
