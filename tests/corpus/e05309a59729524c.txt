ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The carbon dioxide tank used for the euthanasia of guinea pigs has a pressure reducing regulator, but there is
currently no flow meter. The 2013 edition of the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals states that an
appropriate pressure regulator and flow meter or equivalent with demonstrated capability for generating the
recommended displacement rates for the size container being utilized is necessary for the humane application of
CO2. A flow meter needs to be added to the CO2 tank and pressure reducing regulator to ensure the animals are
appropriately euthanized flowing the AVMA Guidelines. Correct by providing a flow meter to the CO2 tank to
monitor the rate of flow for euthanasia. Correct by August 1, 2016.

SANITATION.
The cleaning program utilized is not adequate in removing the heavy buildup of brown roughened scale and debris
from the sides and floor of enclosures. Facility personnel were removing old bedding and debris from enclosures
and adding fresh bedding during this inspection without removing the brown scale and debris from the sides and
floor of enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and/or infrequent sanitization exposes the animals to disease hazards.
Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation
of excreta and debris. Additionally, ensure that the primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
