3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. At least two resting boards and one whelping box are chewed
leaving rough wood. These areas cannot be cleaned and sanitized properly. Surfaces that cannot be cleaned and
sanitized adequately can allow disease hazards to affect the good health of dogs. The breeder must repair or
replace these areas. Also, the breeder needs to put into place a good maintenance program that addresses these
areas before they become an NCI (non-compliant issue). Correct by 01-06-2017
