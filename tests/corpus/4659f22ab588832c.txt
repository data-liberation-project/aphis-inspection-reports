Facilities, outdoor.
The majority of a smaller enclosure between a shelter and water buckets is very muddy. The standing water and sloppy
mud is unavoidable for the two llamas in the enclosure when walking between the water source and the shelter. It had not
rained for several days. The enclosure is a small paddock open to a larger pasture area. The animals have free access to
both areas.
Proper drainage must be maintained to minimize disease risk and discomfort associated with standing water and mud.
