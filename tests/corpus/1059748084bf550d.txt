ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A tan, female pomeranian (Tag # 192) has small to large sized mats on its back legs and tail. The mats are
superficial and are not tightly adhered to the skin. The hair-coat is starting to become rope-like and twisted. Matting
can be painful and can lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. All dogs need to have their hair-coats
routinely maintained in order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases associated with excessive matting.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
In the west outdoor enclosures containing eight dogs, the plastic shelters have severely chewed and worn surfaces
along the entrance. There is a small amount of dirt and hair stuck on the chewed surfaces. Chewed and worn
surfaces cannot be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized, which can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. All chewed
and worn surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they can be readily cleaned and sanitized.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are at least eight plastic shelters being used in the outdoor housing area that have a damaged or missing
wind and rain break. Lack of wind and rain breaks does not ensure the dogs are protected from the elements. The
licensee must ensure all shelters being used be provided with a wind and rain break.
