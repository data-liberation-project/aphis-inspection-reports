Facilities, general.
The following was noted in the outdoor sheep pens: In a pen housing juvenile and adult sheep, four juveniles were able to
access an adjacent pen designated for two male sheep. There was a moderate amount of soil erosion along at least two
fence lines separating the pens, which created holes/ spaces where an animal could slip or get its foot caught. The fence
anchor pipe between pens 5 and 6 is heavily rusted and there are at least 3 small, corroded areas with holes and sharp
edges that could injure animals. In two pens there were feed bunks where a support leg was partially missing and the
structure was unbalanced and rocking, with potential for an animal to get its foot injured. Housing facilities for sheep must
be in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injuries and contain the animals securely. A system of facility
repair and maintenance must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
