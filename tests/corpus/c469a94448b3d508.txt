3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On June 29, 2020, a ferret died due to a primary enclosure malfunction. The ferret was being housed individually in a
double decker ventilated cage, comprised of two levels separated by a non-stationary platform. The ferret was found
unresponsive and trapped between the platform and the cage wall. Shortly after being removed from the enclosure for
medical intervention, the ferret died. Based on the facility’s internal investigation, it was determined that the ferret was
able to push the non-stationary platform up from below and tried to crawl through the gap created between the wall of the
cage and the platform. The investigation concluded that the ferret became entrapped in that space, such that its chest
was compressed, and it was unable to breathe. This enclosure was not constructed of such material and of such strength
as appropriate for the ferret. Housing facilities must be structurally sound to contain and protect the animals from injury. At
the time of inspection, corrective actions and preventative measures had been implemented.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
