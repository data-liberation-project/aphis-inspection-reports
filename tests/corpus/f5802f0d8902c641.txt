3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Whelping boxes in the enclosures are worn and chewed with dark material in the affected areas. The dirt is
concentrated in the worn/chewed areas on the inside and outside of the whelping boxes. Worn and chewed
surfaces are difficult to clean thoroughly and can lead to hazardous health issues for the dogs.
Carpet inside of the whelping boxes and enclosures are excessively worn and chewed on the edges. Loose strings
are observed along with the long strands dangling from the carpet pieces. The strands and loose strings can
potentially cause a physical or internal health hazard.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. The licensee must replace the damaged whelping boxes or
alter them in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitation. The licensee must also replace the shredded
carpets or alter them in a manner that eliminates the strands and loose strings. The licensee must ensure that all
surfaces of housing facilities including objects with in the facility are kept in good repair at all times.

There are a total of six enclosures containing four adults and fifteen puppies with the worn surfaces.
3.6(a)(2)(i) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At least 5 enclosures with 5 adult dogs and 5 puppies has sharp pointy screws penetrating through the plastic
enclosure dividers. The sharp points are at different heights within the enclosure and the dogs could come in
contact with them at any time. The sharp pointy screws put the dogs at a potential risk of physical injury.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could
injure the dogs. The licensee must remove all the sharp points or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury
risk to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(x)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In 1 enclosure, containing 1 adult female dog and 5 puppies, the flooring is constructed of wire. The inspector
observed the right hind foot/leg and the right front foot/leg of at least 1 puppy fall through the openings in the wire
flooring. Openings in flooring that are large enough for the feet and legs to pass through could cause injury to the
foot/leg or entrapment of the puppy.
Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury and does not allow the dogs' feet/legs to pass through any openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the
flooring in a manner that does not allow the feet/legs of the puppies to pass through the openings. The licensee
must ensure that the flooring of the enclosures is safe for the dogs at all times.

is built up and thick on at least 4 of the dog doors, each enclosure has at least one dog. Grime build up can lead to
hazardous health issues for the dogs.
Primary enclosures including dog doors must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris and other disease hazards. The licensee must remove the dirt and grime
buildup from the surfaces of the dog doors and ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities remain free of a buildup
of dirt and grime and other disease hazards.
