CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
***In the enclosure housing approximately one dozen guinea pigs and several sun conures, there was an
unapproved comingling of species.
Guinea pigs should not be housed with other species due to susceptibility and possible transmission
of diseases between the species and risk of injury to the guinea pigs.
The facility shall ensure that guinea pigs are not housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of
animals.

WATERING.
***The enclosure that houses three Red River Hogs uses a shallow pool as the only source of potable water for the
animals in that area. At the time of inspection, the water was murky brown in color.
Potable water receptacles/sources must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the
animals are provided with clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain
adequate hydration.
The facility shall ensure that water sources/receptacles are cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain
standard husbandry practices.
