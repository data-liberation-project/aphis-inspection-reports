2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 6.5 year old tan female Poodle (microchip #032-585-888) had a chunk of tartar that was loose and wiggling
around quite a bit on the right side of it's mouth. When the tartar was pulled up, it appeared there may have been a
tooth that had been dislodged from the gums and hanging within the middle of the tartar. In addition there was
heavy tartar buildup on both sides of the mouth. When asked the licensee stated he did not know the last time the
dog had a dental done. Dental problems can be painful and can lead to systemic infection which could be
detrimental to the dog's health. The loose chunk of tartar on the right side of the mouth (whether or not a tooth is
lodged in the middle of the tartar) and the heavy buildup of tartar in general indicates that the dog is in need of a
dental.
In addition to the dental problems, this dog was matted up quite a bit around the eyes to the point that it made it
difficult to examine the dog's eyes. Matted up fur can be painful as it can start pulling on the skin. It can cause
irritation and it makes it difficult for the licensee to properly observe the dog on a daily basis to ensure there are no
health issues with the dog. The dog's fur should be clipped/trimmed around the eyes. This should be done on a
regular basis from here on out to ensure the dog doesn't get matted up around the eyes in the future.
The Attending Veterinarian must be consulted with in regards to the dog. The dog must be treated per his/her
instructions.
3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At least one enclosure was not meeting the minimum floor space requirement for the two dogs it contained. One
side of the enclosure measured 23'' by 36.75''. The other side measured 23'' by 20.25''. The enclosure contained
1,311 square inches of space. The first dog was a 4-5 month old brindle/white female English Bulldog. She
measured 24.25'' and required 915.0625 square inches of space. The second dog was a 3 month old tan female
Poodle. She measured 14.25'' and required 410.0625 square inches of space. Together these two dogs required
1,325.125 square inches of space. The enclosure was short by 14.125 square inches of space. Cage space
requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their enclosures. It minimizes thedogs from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread of disease. The licensee must
ensure that all enclosures containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the minimum floor space
requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that enclosure. Correct immediately.
3.8(a)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
At least two enclosures each containing a single dog did not have the two times of required floor space for those
dogs and the dogs were not being provided the opportunity to exercise regularly. The first enclosure contained a
two year old female cream colored Bichon (microchip #0A02116865). The enclosure measured 36" by 30" for a
total of 1,080 square inches of space. The dog was 22'' long and required 1,568 square inches of space when
housed individually and not being provided the opportunity to exercise regularly. The licensee stated the dog is not
provided with any additional opportunities to exercise. The enclosure was short by 488 square inches of space.
The second enclosure measured 48'' by 35.75'' for a total of 1,716 square inches of space. The dog was a 3 year
old brown/white female English Bulldog (microchip #0A02511233). She measured 28'' and required 2,312 square
inches of space when housed individually and not being provided the opportunity to exercise regularly. The
licensee stated he takes the dog out for exercise about every 8 weeks or so. The enclosure was short by 596
square inches of space.
Not providing the dogs regular opportunities to exercise when the dogs are housed individually in an enclosure that
is less than two times the required floor space for that dog doesn't ensure that the dogs have enough room or are
getting enough exercise to meet their physical and mental needs. The licensee must ensure these dogs are either
being provided regular opportunities to exercise or the dogs must be provided enclosures that are more than two
times the required floor space for each dog. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
