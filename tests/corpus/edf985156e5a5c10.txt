Housing facilities, general.
Food is not being stored properly to protect it from spoilage, contamination and vermin infestation. An open bag of dog
food was observed in one of the dog buildings, it was not being stored in any other container or receptacle.
Open bags of food can become contaminated by pests such as insects and rodents which could have a negative impact
on the health and well-being of the dogs. All open supplies of food must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitted
lids. The licensee must move the open bag of food into a leakproof container with a tightly fitted lid. The licensee must
ensure that all food is properly stored at all times.

Watering
In two enclosures, one with 3 dogs and one with 1 dog, there were empty water bowls, with no other water available.
When water was presented, the dogs drank for a few seconds. Lack of water could cause the dogs to become dehydrated
or other health issues. Having potable water available continuously is important to the health of the dogs. The licensee
must ensure all dogs always have access to potable water.
Corrected during inspection.


3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Program of Veterinary Care presented at time of inspection did not mention the sampling and treatment of parasites
(including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia and heartworm) nor did it include a schedule for their sampling. It did not
mention any schedule of when preventative care and treatment (including eyes, ears, skin, teeth, hair coat and nails)
would occur. It did not state that the attending veterinarian would inspect the premises nor that they would complete a
head-to-tail exam on each adult dog on a yearly basis.
An appropriate Program of Veterinary Care must include sampling for parasites, a preventative care plan, a statement
that the attending veterinarian will inspect the premises annually and examine all adult dogs on an annual basis to ensure
the health and well-being of the dogs.
The applicant must add to have the dogs sampled for parasites, a schedule for preventative care and a statement that the
attending veterinarian will inspect the premises and examine the adult dogs on a yearly basis to the Program of Veterinary
Care for Dogs.
