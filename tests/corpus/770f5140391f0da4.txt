2.32(a) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
In March 2019, one adult singing mouse was found dead in an enclosure. The death occurred when the mouse
became trapped between the cage grid and the microisolator top on the enclosure. The investigation of the incident
concluded that perhaps a cage grid which was slightly bent had been used on this enclosure. This created just
enough space for the mouse to squeeze through. Corrective action included retraining caretakers to check for
damage to the cage gridding prior to use for the singing mice. Signage has been added in the room to indicate the
correct cage grid size to use for these small active mice.
In July 2019, four adult singing mice and several nursing pups were found deceased . An investigation determined a
caretaker had overlooked these animals and they were not fed for several days. The other animals in the room had
received daily feed. An experienced rodent caretaker assumed responsibilities for the singing mice. The newly
assigned caretaker was monitored by the ARC supervisor for several months until it was determined that there were
no training issues regarding care of these animals.
In August 2019, four macaques escaped their enclosure and comingled in an animal room resulting in injury to two
of the animals. The injuries ( bite wounds ) required veterinary care . An investigation determined that the animals
escaped as a result of a caretaker failing to latch the enclosure properly. Corrective action has included retraining of
all primate caretakers on the correct way to latch and secure all non human primate caging types used at this
facility. Signage showing the correct way to latch all non human primate enclosure has been added to rooms to
further ensure the cages are latched properly.
It shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal
technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.
This responsibility shall be fulfilled in part through the provision of training and instruction to those personnel.
