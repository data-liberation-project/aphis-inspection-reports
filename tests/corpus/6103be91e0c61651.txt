3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The barn housing the three white-tailed deer has the following areas of disrepair:

- Along one of the walls, there is a board missing and the underlying wood has a hole that is approx. 3in x 8in and is
between 3-4 feet above ground level.

- In one of the back corners of the barn, there is missing, damaged, and rotted wood, resulting in a small gap that leads to
the outside. Some of this damaged wood has jagged edges that are approx. 1-2ft above ground level.

- Also in the back corner of the barn, the ceiling has a large patch of water-damaged wood.

Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. The gaps and jagged edges of the wood are
within reach of the animals and can cause injury to them. The water damaged ceiling could potentially result in water
leaking into the enclosure or a partial collapse of the ceiling itself. Correct by repairing the damaged areas of wood.
