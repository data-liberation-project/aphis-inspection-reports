Contingency planning.
There was no written contingency plan available at time of this inspection. Failure to have a written contingency plan can
result in lack of readiness for emergencies or disasters which could impact animal health and well-being. Facilities must
develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing,
and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 10/14/2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
