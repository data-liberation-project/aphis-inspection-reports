Housing facilities, general.
There is a leak in the roof above the Chimpanzee Day Room 1. There was water streaking down the wall above the
service door located in the main hallway. Water drops were dripping down from the rusting door frame and pooling onto
the floor.

Water can cause structural damage such as weakening of walls and support structures, rusting, and cause environments
that promote the growth of mold. These factors not rectified could negatively affect the health and welfare of the primates
enclosed and cause a trip hazard to animal caretakers.

Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the
species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals
from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.

Housing facilities, general.
There are several areas in the great ape escape enclosures that need repair. In the Orangutan Day Room 2 there is a
crack in the concrete step close to the public viewing glass wall. The paint has been peeled off the step below the crack.

In the Chimpanzee Day Room 4 there is an approximate .5 ft. X .75 ft. area on the wall near the shift door to Day Room 3,
where the concrete needs to be repaired then repainted.

These abraded and damaged areas cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and could trap organic debris and disease
causing organisms that could affect the health of the nonhuman primates.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
