2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility does not have a current written program of veterinary care approved by the current attending
veterinarian. The facility has a program of veterinary care signed on 10/9/2014 by the previous attending
veterinarian. A written program of veterinary care is necessary to ensure that the facility staff understands
the expectations of the attending veterinarian in regards to the care and use of the animals. A program of
veterinary care must be written, approved by the current attending veterinarian as part of the formal arrangement
between the facility and the attending veterinarian, and the facility must have a copy of the program in order to
ensure adherence to the program of veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Ten guinea pigs were found during inspection which had health issues.
Four had eye issues. One black and white juvenile guinea pig's right eye was pasted closed with a greenish
discharge. Licensee caught the individual and opened the eye, though it remained squinty.
One adult red and white guinea pig has a squinty left eye which it held persistently only partially open.
A brown and white adult guinea pig has a left eye which only partially opens. The eyelids appear thick and rough
looking. Licensee stated the eye has always been that way, but there is no documentation showing that it has
been evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis or possible treatment.
A black and white adult guinea pig is wet on the right side of its face. The mucoid discharge appears to be coming
from the right eye. This guinea pig is also missing hair under the chin. The right side of the neck and face is
hairless. Another white and brown adult guinea pig is also missing hair on its neck and face.
A black and brown adult guinea pig is missing hair in the middle of its face. The lesion appears to have thickened
skin and is scaly.
A grey/brown guinea pig has a firm lump under its chin on the right side of its neck. The lump is smooth, firm and
about walnut sized.

A black and white female guinea pig appears thin, dull, and has a sparse haircoat. Licensee stated she had
recently
given birth. Her right ear is thick and has a raw lesion on it.
A black and white adult guinea pig is reluctant to move and breathing heavy.
A brown and white juvenile guinea pig appears unable to walk in a straight line, unless it is near the wall of the
enclosure. This guinea pig persistently circles to the right.
These guinea pigs require veterinary care for their health and well being. Licensee must use appropriate methods
to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. These animals must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and plan shall
be maintained for examination by APHIS officials

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee currently only tracks sales by maintaining sales receipts. The licensee was able to give an
approximate number of animals on hand, but had no records verifying the inventory. There were also no
records of any births and no records of any deaths (either natural or by euthanasia) occurring in the last six
months. Accurate records of all acquisitions (including births) and dispositions (including deaths) are necessary
to evaluate trends and monitor the health of the colony. Correct by developing and maintaining all required records
including all acquisitions and dispositions.

WATERING.
The water receptacles are too dirty. Wet bedding and a dark brown substance is adhered to the water
receptacles and water lines. The wire mesh of the primary enclosures near the water lines and pipes is
encrusted with a dark material. This environment is ideal for bacteria and other health hazards to grow,
posing a health risk for the animals. All watering receptacles shall be cleaned and sanitized when dirty.
