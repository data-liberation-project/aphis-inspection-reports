OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shade structures or natural shaded areas are not provided for dogs in the outdoor play area. As part of their
program of veterinary care, dogs are let out for exercise at different times of the day and cannot be protected from
the direct rays of the sun.
Outdoor facilities for dogs must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each
outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a
normal manner, and to turn about freely. In addition to the shelter structures, one or more separate outside areas of
shade must be provided, large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of
the sun.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The flooring of the outdoor play area for dogs is coated with a textured sealant. According to the attending
veterinarian and a facility representative, the floor coating/sealant is too abrasive for dogs that want to run and
exercise, and, has caused repeated injury to the footpads of a dog used in the RVT program. The facility has put
down areas of carpet so dogs can rest on a smoother surface if desired.
The flooring/ surfaces of an outdoor housing facility should be resurfaced and maintained in a manner that protects
the dogs from injury.

3.125(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fencing along the back and sides of the goat pens, and buck pens, have been repaired and patched with new
material and clasps over the years. Although the facility has a system in place to maintain housing enclosures in
good repair, the enclosures are no longer structurally sound and are difficult to maintain as required.
According to the program veterinarians, and medical records reviewed, there have been 5 reported fence/ wire
related injuries to goats housed in these pens, including vaginal, ear, and limb lacerations, since August of 2018.
The fencing material for all the goat pens should be replaced for the health and safety of these animals.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

WATERING.
There is one pig housed at the red barn. The water receptacle for this animal is located inside the barn and potable
water is provided daily. On the outside area of the enclosure there is a cement water trough that appears to be out
of reach for the pig. The facility representative stated that the receptacle is not for pig use. The trough is full of
standing water, appears to have algae along the sides and bottom, is attracting flying insects, and larvae has been
observed by a facility representative. The water trough should be drained or maintained in a manner that provides
potable water in the event the pig gets access to it.

SANITATION.
The red barn houses one pig that inhabits one stall and has access to an outside yard. The feed and water is
located inside the barn and is protected. There are fly bags around this stall and strategically placed metal spikes
above the enclosure, on the rafters, to deter the avian pests.
In the back corner of the barn, there is a heavy accumulation of discarded items being stored. This includes hoses,
chicken wire fencing, farm equipment, liquids, etc. There is also an accumulation of avian and rodent droppings in
this area. A rodent was observed running through this area at time of inspection.
The stall next to the discarded items is filled with approximately 4 bales of straw that have come apart to form a
large mound. A facility representative stated the hay has been dried out like this for over 1 month.There are avian
and rodent droppings present in this area. Straw stored in this manner can attract rodents and other pests as wellas create other hazards.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed
in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.

SANITATION.
There is an accumulation of avian droppings and rodent/ mammalian feces present in at least 5 areas of the red
barn. One stall had a moderate to heavy amount of flies swarming around the waste material.The presence of
avian and mammalian pests, and flying insects can increase disease hazards in animal areas.
The area should be cleaned and a safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian
and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained.
