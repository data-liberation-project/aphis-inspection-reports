2.33(b)(5)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Adequate post-procedural care was not provided for a group of 86 animals used under a single activity. Local,
post-surgical analgesic use was not in accordance with current established veterinary medical procedures. Failure
to adhere to current established veterinary medical procedures may cause the animals unnecessary discomfort and
pain. The facility should ensure that adequate pre and post-procedural care is provided to all animals used in
activities regulated by the Animal Welfare Act.
This non-compliant item should be corrected for all future procedures.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
