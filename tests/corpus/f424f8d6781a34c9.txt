2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The licensee notified Animal Care that they had moved the facility to a new site November 2021. On 26-April-2022, an
inspector performed a courtesy visit at the facility after calling the licensee about a new site inspection. During the
courtesy visit, the inspector stated the licensee could not conduct regulated activity without passing a new site inspection.
The licensee has sold 35 dogs since 14-February-2022 from the new site that has not been approved site by APHIS
officials. Conducting regulated activity from an unapproved site does not follow the Animal Welfare Act and does not
ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.
The licensee must pass a new site inspection before conducting regulated activity.
2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
#308, an adult female maltese, was examined by the inspector and found to have a loose upper left cheek tooth that
moved easily when the inspector touched it and the gums were bleeding at the base of this tooth. The front upper incisors
also had a receding gum line but did not moved when touched by the inspector. This dog had a dental done on 9-July-
2022. The inspector called the attending veterinarian whom stated this dog should be seen to evaluate the condition.
Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. This dog must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and

treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that
all dogs receive adequate veterinary care.

Several medications were found to be stored inappropriately according to the label or were expired or had no expiration
date:
*Stress drops stated they should be refrigerated after opening but were being stored in a cabinet at room temperature
*Albon- no expiration date
*Ivermectin- no expiration date
*Entederm- expired 05/2020
*Udder balm- expired 10/1999
*Ponazuril- no expiration date
*Neopar vaccines in the refridgerater stated they should be stored 35-45 degrees Farhenheit, the inspector's kestrel
thermometer read 46.2 degrees Fahrenheit
*3 ml syringes- expired 06/2019 and 06/05/2021
*Karo syrup is being stored in a mustard bottle without a lid and is not labeled with the product inside or the expiration
date of the syrup.
Improperly labeled medical products and missing expiration date information does not ensure that the appropriate product
is used and the health of the animal may suffer.
Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure all medications are appropriately labeled with what is in the bottles and each medication is not expired. The
licensee must ensure all medications and supplements are stored at the appropriate temperature that is listed on the
products label.

2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee gave Ivermectin to all adult dogs on 1-July-2022, which was not approved by the attending veterinarian
verbally or in writing. There is no dose for adults listed on the Program of Veterinary Care, only a dose for puppies at 4
and 8 weeks of age. Giving medications without veterinary approval does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate
veterinary care.
Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being can be discussed and a treatment plan can be made. The licensee
must communicate any animal health concerns with their attending veterinarian so that an effective treatment plan can be
put in place.
2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility uses cage cards as the record of acquisition for the dogs born at the facility. There were six litters of puppies
with their dams with no official identification number assigned to them; litter of 2 Yorkies born 21-July-2022, 1 chihuahua
puppy born 18-July-2022, litter of 4 Maltese-bichons born 30-July-2022, 1 Pomeranian cross born 5-July-2022, litter of 5
Pomeranians born 25-July-2022 and litter of 2 Yorkie/Pomeranians born 18-July-2022. The litter of 2 Yorkie/Pomeranians
born 18-July-2022 was also missing the breed of the puppies. These cage cards were all missing "USDA" and the
licensee's USDA number. All missing cage card information was filled out at the time of inspection.

The Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) is missing acquisition information for several
dogs. Certain acquisition information was corrected at the time of inspection.
**Full addresses were missing for the following dogs: Pomeranians #128, #7, Maltese #306 (fixed), #307 (fixed), #308
(fixed), #303, #304, Yorkies #55, #100 and #82..

**Missing the USDA License number of the person whom dogs were purchased from for the following dogs: Pomeranians
#128 and #7, Maltese #304, Yorkies #55, #100 and #82.
Accurate acquisition information is necessary for APHIS officials to make positive identification of animals during
inspection and to properly trace their movements. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain an approved method of
documentation which fully and correctly disclose all information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired,
owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or
otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her
possession or under his or her control.

The Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) is missing disposition information. Disposition forms for
the following dogs are missing the full address and USDA number for the Buyer of the dogs. Identification numbers 1 and
2 sold 14-February-2022, #3-6 sold 21-February-2022, #7 and 8 sold 4-April-2022, #9-11 sold 6-May-2022, #12-14 sold
23-May-2022, #15-26 sold 30-May-2022, #27-29 sold 13-June-2022, #31-35 sold 4-July-2022.

The Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) is missing the method of transportation including the
name of the initial carrier or intermediate handler, or, if a privately owned vehicle is used to transport a dog or cat, the
name of the owner of the privately owned vehicle for #30 Male Pomeranian sold 24-June-2022.

The licensee must record the acquisition and disposition information and ensure all required acquisition and disposition
information is properly and accurately documented at all times.
2.75(a)(1)(vi)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.

The licensee sold two different dogs with the same official identification number. An 8 week old Maltese male born 17-
April-2022 was sold with the official identification #27 on a sale form on 13-June-2022. An adult Pomeranian born 11-
February-2021 was sold with the same official identification #27 on 11-June-2022.
Failure to document the proper identification number on required documents interferes with APHIS officials’ ability to
identify animals and trace their movements. Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records that fully disclose the
official identification number of each animal. The licensee must ensure that the correct unique individual official
identification number is recorded on all required paperwork for each dog.
3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
There are at least 4 sharp points from wire that is used to hold the self feeders in place in 2 enclosures containing 7 adult
dogs. The wire pieces are at eye level of the dogs. Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.
Housing facilities for dogs must protect the animals from injury. The licensee must remove the sharp points in order to
protect the dogs from injury. The licensee must maintain all enclosures in good repair and ensure that the housing
conditions are safe for the dogs at all times.
3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
In the food storage area, there is a pallet of dog food being stored against the wall of the room. There are cobwebs and
dust present between the wall and the bags of dog food.
Food stored against walls does not allow for cleaning around the pallets of supplies. Not having enough space between
the wall and food to clean may cause the supplies to become contaminated. The licensee must store food away from the
walls enough to allow for cleaning around the food supplies.


In a cabinet, a bottle of bleach and a can of WD-40 were stored directly next to "B Strong" supplement and a can of dog
food. Below this cabinet was another cabinet that contained more medications and supplements. For safety of the dogs,
toxic chemicals, like cleaning supplies and caustic chemicals, must be properly stored so they won't fall into areas where
it may potentially contaminate their food, medications and supplements.
All toxic chemicals must be stored in cabinets, separated from food, medications and supplements.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee has two different vaccine and deworming schedules for adults and puppies approved by the Attending
Veterinarian. It is unclear to the inspector which one they are following at the time of inspection. The licensee must follow
one vaccination and deworming schedule approved by the Attending Veterinarian to ensure the dogs are adequately
protected from contagious and/or deadly diseases of dogs (including rabies, parvovirus and distemper) and protected
from parasites and other pests (including worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm).

The Program of Veterinary Care is missing the sampling and treatment plan for ectoparasites for adults. It states "Ivomec
given to puppies at 4 and 8 weeks." This plan does not ensure the adult dogs are regularly sampled for fleas and ticks or
have a preventative treatment plan in place to protect them from ectoparasites. The licensee must create a sampling and
treatment plan for ectoparasites and have it approved by the attending veterinarian.

The Program of Veterinary Care states 3 adults will be sampled annually for heartworms, intestinal worms, giardia and
coccidia. The licensee has not completed this testing at the time of inspection. Sampling of these contagious and/or
deadly diseases ensures the dogs are not contracting these diseases and are protected from illnesses. The licensee must
have 3 dogs tested for heartworms, intestinal worms, giardia and coccidia and follow the Program of Veterinary Care.

3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee does not have an effective preventative treatment plan for properly trimmed nails, clean and healthy eyes,
ears and skin. The plan does not state who and how often the nails, eyes, ears and skin will be checked or when a
veterinarian will be consulted. The plan does not state when a vet will be consulted for problems with healthy and un-
matted hair coats or clean and healthy teeth. The Program of Veterinary Care states each item will be "checked as
needed, the dogs will be groomed twice a year and the teeth will be checked annually or as needed." A preventative
treatment plan for healthy and un-matted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, clean and healthy eyes, ears, teeth and skin
is necessary to ensure dog's to remain healthy and do not develop diseases or medical issues that can be uncomfortable
and possibly painful. The applicant must develop a preventative treatment plan for healthy and un-matted hair coats,
properly trimmed nails, clean and healthy eyes, ears, teeth and skin that includes how often each item will be checked on
a dog and when a veterinarian will be consulted and have the Attending Veterinarian approve of the plan.
