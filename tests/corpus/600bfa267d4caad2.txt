3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The perch inside the sheltered area for the two snow macaques has an excessive accumulation of dried excreta. The
facility reports this area might have been missed on spot cleans that are done for the rest of the enclosure. Accumulations
of excreta could make animals sick. Ensure that all hard surfaces that the non-human primates contact are spot-cleaned
daily and sanitized at least every 2 weeks or more often if soiled.

Facilities, general.
Some enclosure areas were in need of repair:
-There is an area about 20 inches wide by 16 inches deep that washed out under a section the sika deer pen.
-There is a hole in the bottom of the bison fence where the bull reportedly pushed against it.
-The area by a brown bear's treat tube is getting dug out by the brown bear and has a small area of buried fence with
points that is exposed to the bear.



The areas by the sika deer and bison fence, if left unrepaired could allow the contained animals to push on the holes and
potentially get out or injured. The area in the brown bear's pen has a point of wire that could possibly hurt the bear.
Ensure that all enclosures are maintained in good repair to safely contain the animals and protect them from injury. Note:
The facility has a plan in place to ensure these items are corrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
