ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:45pm on
09-Apr-19.
I arrived at the facility at 2:45pm. There was a construction crew on site but the owner was not available, nor was an
authorized individual. I called the cell phone number on file and left a message. The facility owner texted me back at
2:57pm to let me know that she was not available and her husband had gone into town. I let her know that I would
wait for a little while to see if he made it home. I left at 3:30pm because no one had called nor met me at the facility.
