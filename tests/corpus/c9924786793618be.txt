ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:15pm on
07-Mar-19.
I waited 30 minutes in the driveway of the facility after leaving a voicemail on the licensees phone that i was at the
property to conduct an inspection. After 30 minutes I left the area to when I was contacted by the licensee who
advised that there was no one available to conduct an inspection on this date. New times of availability were
discussed for future inspections due to a change in their schedule as of this date.
