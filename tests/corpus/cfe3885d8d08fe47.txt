SANITATION.
The pen area inside the barn housing approximately 180 goats has an excessive accumulation of fecal droppings.
Approximately 75% of the pen area was completely covered with packed, wet fecal material. The superintendent
reported it had been about three weeks since the area was cleaned. Additionally, the superintendent also stated
that the animals are sometimes restricted to the pen during inclement weather, but the area of clean space in the
pen is not large enough to hold all 180 goats. This means some animal would be forced to stand or lay in feces. The
pen must be cleaned and maintained on a more frequent basis to ensure the animals can remain clean and to
reduce disease hazards. Multiple parasitic diseases are more easily spread through unsanitary conditions.
Furthermore, accumulation of feces in the environment promotes bacterial and fungal growth in the foot. The
licensee must ensure that all excreta is removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors. Correct by ensuring that all animals
areas are cleaned as often as necessary. Correct by 2/14/2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Superintendent.
