Sheltered housing facilities.
There is no public barrier in the front and on the side of an enclosure housing one ring-tailed lemur. The enclosure has
two types of metal wire fencing material overlying each other, however there is still enough space between them for
children and/or adults to stick their fingers through and possibly contact the animal. A barrier must be present between the
primary enclosure and the public at any time the public is present, that restricts physical contact between the public and
the nonhuman primates.
