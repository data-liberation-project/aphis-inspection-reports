ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Although there are records of regular veterinary care for the animals, the written Program of Veterinary Care had
not been completed.
A formalized plan of veterinary care can lead to more consistent, thorough care for the regulated animals. For the
health and well being of the animals, the written Program of Veterinary Care should be completed. Formal
arrangements with the attending veterinarian should include regularly scheduled visits to the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an approximately 5" x 5" hole in a section of the wire fencing surrounding a shrub within the deer pen.
This resulted in pieces of exposed wire around the hole protruding towards the pen. Deer could potentially injure
themselves on these sections of exposed wire while attempting to feed on plants within the enclosed area. It was
explained that one of the animals had likely created the hole.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

The inspection was conducted with the Maintenance Manager and the exit briefing was conducted with the Director
of Operations.
