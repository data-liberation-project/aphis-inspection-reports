FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Tools and other items are stacked next to the supply of alfalfa making it difficult to clean around the hay and to
check for pests. They also provide a hiding area for pests such as rodents. Supplies of hay should be stored in such
a manner to prevent contamination by vermin. Keeping the area around the hay free from debris and other items will
allow pest problem to be quickly detected which would aid in protecting supplies from contamination.
