ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 PM on
25-Jan-17.
Spoke with the licensee via cell phone. The licensee was out of state. The licensee stated she has no animals and
wants to relinquish her license. I gave the licensee instructions on how to accomplish this.
