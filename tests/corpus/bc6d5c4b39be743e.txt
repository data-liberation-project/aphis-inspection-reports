Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The baboon enclosure did not appear to have been cleaned in some time. There was an excessive accumulation of feces
and old food on the side with mulch. The concrete side had old food and dirt stuck to the concrete.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from inside primary enclosures daily to prevent excessive accumulation. Old
food that is left in enclosures can become moldy and cause illness and it can attract pests that can cause disease or
irritate the animals.
The baboon enclosure needs to be spot cleaned daily and washed/sanitized more frequently.

enclosure for extended periods of time can attract pests that can cause disease or irritate the animals.
The porcupine enclosure needs to be cleaned more frequently.
