2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**Six of the dog or dog hybrids had passed away between 2/13/15 and 3/5//15. Most had been euthanized at a
nearby veterinary clinic following what was explained to be unrelated acute illnesses.The attending veterinarian did
not learn about the illness of these animals, treatments received or their death until 3/14/15, approximately nine
days after the last animal died and one month after the first animal died.
**The dog hybrid Tahzay was observed to be ill (abnormal breathing, coughing, not eating normally, dry heaving) on
2/11/15 and was brought inside for observation as per the licensee's recommendation. He was brought to a nearby
veterinary clinic on 2/16/15, but euthanized at the same clinic about a week later after failure to respond to
treatment. Although there were several days between observation of Tahzay's illness and his veterinary care
appointment, the attending veterinarian had not been notified of Tahzay's condition at any time during his illness.
**It was explained that one of the dogs, currently under observation for post- surgical treatment, had experienced a
large amount of diarrhea the previous day and had last been observed eating by staff two days ago. The attending
veterinarian had not been notified of this condition until time of inspection and recommended a change in treatment
at time of inspection.
Daily observation of the animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided
that a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Failure to communicate illness, whether it appears mild or serious, to the attending veterinarian, could result in
improper care of the animals. For example, this could lead to failure to seek professional veterinary care in a timely
manner or provision of care that may not be appropriate for the animal's condition. A procedure should be adopted
by which changes in health status or behavior of an animal are immediately reported to the attending veterinarian.

FEEDING.
**It was explained that the dog and dog hybrids that had not been isolated for veterinary care purposes were fasted
twice a week on Wednesdays and Sundays. This practice was not recommended by the attending veterinarian.
Dogs and cats must be fed at least once a day, except as otherwise might be required to provide adequate
veterinary
care.
The diet must be appropriate for the individual animal's age and condition, as inadequate feeding could predispose
to
unintended changes in metabolism, body condition, behavior, and development of disease.
Correct from this day forward.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
**There is an excessive density of trees and shrubs in approximately 12 of the older, non-updated large enclosures
containing about 20 dog hybrids.
It is difficult to observe all of the animals appropriately in order to assess health. Growth of brush may also inhibit
pest control and cleaning of the enclosure. It may also make it difficult to observe and remove deteriorating feed
hidden by animals. These issues could become more pronounced as foliage develops on trees in the spring and
summer.
For the health and well being of the animals, excessive density of weeds, grasses, and brushes must be addressed.
