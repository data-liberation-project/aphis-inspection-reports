ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
**Required facility records (the program of veterinary care, animal inventory/acquisition records, and records of
animal dispositions) were not available for review at the time of inspection. The unavailability of the required
records does not allow APHIS Officials to determine: if the records are accurate and complete, that the program of
veterinary care is being followed to ensure the health of the animals, or for the proper tracking of the animals
housed at the facility.
Maintain all required records at the facility so they are available for review at the time of inspection.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
**Three sheep (adult, 2 lambs) were housed in a narrow portion of the larger outdoor enclosure. The section
housing sheep measured approximately 10'x25' and was separated by a closed gate from the larger portion of the
enclosure, measuring approximately 22'x25'. The closed gate restricted the animal's access to the barn structure
located inside the larger area of the enclosure. The sheep had access in the closed off area to several buckets with
water, however, two food receptacles were bare with no evidence food had recently been in the containers and one
food container had a large hole in the bottom.
**Animals housed outdoors should have access to shelter. Protection from inclement weather should be provided
when animals are housed outdoors by allowing access to shelter in order to prevent discomfort to those animals.
