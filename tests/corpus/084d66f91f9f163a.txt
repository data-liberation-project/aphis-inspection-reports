2.31(c)(7) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
There is a deviation from the number of animals described in protocol 3.
- On 8/26/2021 the primary investigator for Protocol 3 submitted an amendment requesting more animals from the holding
animal cadre to use as negative study controls. The IACUC sent the revision request back to the PI for clarification of
animal usage. The IACUC approved the amendment on 9/7/2021. However, the Primary Investigator did not wait for
approval and used dog #1 from the holding protocol on 8/30/2021. This was a deviation from the existing protocol and
should not have been conducted prior to IACUC approval of the amendment.
Animal Care and Use Protocols must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to animal utilization. Any
amendments or significant changes to a protocol must also be approved by the IACUC prior to animal utilization. The
IACUC must approve and monitor all procedures on regulated animals to assure adherence to the allowed procedures.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
An expired bottle of euthanasia solution was used on 7 animals over a 6 month period of time before being discovered by
an internal audit of controlled substances on 8/4/21. The bottle of euthanasia solution expired January 2021. This bottle
was utilized on 02/02/21 on a rabbit, on 6/03/21 on rabbits and guinea pigs and lastly on 06/21/21 on a calf, based on


controlled drug logs. There were no reports of euthanasia difficulties using the expired euthanasia solution. Expired
medications may have unpredictable effects and are not appropriate medical care. The veterinarian in question is no
longer working at the facility and the IACUC has implemented a program to locate and dispose of expired medications.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
