ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:35 AM on
06-Dec-16.
No one present at site. Attempted to contact licensee via phone and text. Left voicemail. Went to additional site that
licensee recently informed me of; no one present there either. Stayed in the area for 30 mins. Licensee's assistant
contacted me later to report that licensee is out of town.
