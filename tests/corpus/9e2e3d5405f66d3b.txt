2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-- In the back of the facility, there was a brown and white, long-haired, female guinea pig with an open wound and
lesions on her left hip. The wound approximately two inches in diameter was circular in shape, reddened, moist with
fresh blood and was hairless. Additional, older, scabby lesions outlined the edge of the fresh wound. The licensee
stated that this was the first time the wound had been noticed. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian
had not been consulted and no treatment had been administered. An open wound can be painful causing
discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which affects the health and well-being of the guinea pig. The
licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
and treatment of the wound is provided. Any medical records must be made available to the inspector upon
request. The licensee was given verbal instruction to have this animal examined by the end of business 7/26/17.
The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
To be corrected by: 7/26/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
