3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- In the indoor enclosures of the medical building housing non-human primates there are three large elevated
wooden resting platforms in poor condition. The wood on these platforms is chipped, splintered, chewed and in
need of repair. Wood platforms in this condition are a potential source of injury to the enclosed animals and cannot
be properly cleaned and sanitized. The facility must repair or replace these surfaces to help ensure the health of
the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- A trail of rodent droppings was observed on the middle horizontal rail in the indoor portion of the enclosures in the
non-human primate building. This rail is clearly being used as a travel area for rodents to move from cage to cage.
These droppings are also on the resting surfaces for the chimpanzees and the Hamadryas Baboon, and were noted
among and adjacent to feed and water. Rodents carry diseases and may cause illness to the enclosed animals.
They can also contaminate food, water and living areas. Two rodent traps were located in the corners of the room,
but it is unclear if they had been properly prepared and monitored. The licensee must have an adequate program to
control pests in this building and must ensure proper pest control throughout the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the feed barn, there are numerous square bales of hay being stored directly on the floor and against the
adjacent walls. Hay and other feed should be stored on pallets with space between the feed and the walls to
minimize contamination from pests and the environment.
- In the commissary there are numerous plastic buckets in poor condition being used to store feed. The buckets are
dirty, scratched, and not fit to safely store food. These buckets should be repaired or replaced, and the facility must
take steps to ensure that all food storage bins are kept clean and in good condition.Correct by: 28 March 2015
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the front section of the park two separate tiger enclosures had pieces of raw meat sitting on top of the shade
structures, evidently from employees attempting to feed the animals by throwing meat over the fencing. Park policy
is to feed through the metal feed chutes located in the fence walls. Meat left on top of the fencing or shade
structures will quickly turn rancid and become an attractant for insects, pests, and wild animals. Food not
consumed must be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

- In the commissary there were bins containing mice and rats intended for use as reptile food. In one bin there were
two dead rats, one of which was extremely decomposed. The facility representative stated a park employee had
notified him that morning that a rat had died but the park employee left the corpse inside the bin. Carcasses are an
attractant for numerous pests and are a potential source of contamination to the surrounding area. Provision shall
be made for the removal and disposal of animal and food wastes to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease
hazards.
3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- At the rear of the park, a tiger named Batista was singly housed in an enclosure which did not have a shade
structure. Lack of adequate shade exposes the animal to unnecessary environmental stress which can negatively
impact its health and well being. Th licensee must provide appropriate shade to help protect the health and welfare
of the enclosed animals.
Corrected during the inspection by shifting the animal to another enclosure.
