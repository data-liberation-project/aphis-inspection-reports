HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were structures in the facility that were not being maintained. In the smaller building housing the French
Bulldogs, there were particle board structures that had been chewed and were ragged. In the larger, sheltered
building, the first outdoor run on the outside had broken wires on the fencing material used to patch the bottom
portion of the enclosure fencing. There were also broken wires on the floor of a suspended wire enclosure. All
structures must be constructed with materials that protect the animals from injury and contain the animals. The
particle board panels and wire must be replaced or repaired.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
There were at least two food receptacles that were dirty. There was dirt/grime on the interior and exterior of the
receptacles. There was also brown insect larvae in the food receptacle in one enclosure. There was a spider on
the interior of another food receptacle. The food receptacles must be cleaned frequently enough to provide
uncontaminated, wholesome food. These food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an excessive accumulation of rodent feces on the floor, window sills, and top of the wooden enclosure
boxes inside the sheltered kennel building. There was also brown insect larvae in the food receptacle in one
enclosure. There was a spider on the interior of another food receptacle. The licensee must establish and maintain
an effective program for the control of pests to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in animal areas. These areas must also be cleaned more often.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative and Jeff Baker, Veterinary Medical
Officer.
