HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At time of inspection two outdoor enclosures housing three dogs have two holes dug in the dirt runs. The holes
range in size from three foot in depth and a foot to three feet in circumference. The two of holes are in the dirt that
undermines the cement flooring in the barn and red building where 2 Labs and one Chihuahua are being housed.
The holes are large enough that a dog could become entrapped in the hole underneath the concrete. The licensee
must keep facilities in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely. To be
corrected by 03-20-15.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
