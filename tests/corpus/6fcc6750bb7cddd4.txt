FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. The enclosure for the two goats is in need of repair. Wire mesh in
the back left corner has rusted and broken leaving a large hole and sharp points exposed which could injure the
animals. This area need to be addressed so that the enclosure protects the animals from injury.
In the enclosure for the single goat there is a wooden feed box at the front of the enclosure which has been pushed
in on one side and the screws are exposed with sharp points. This box needs to be repaired, replaced or removed
to ensure the animals safety.

3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. At time of this inspection there is a large pile of hay on the floor
directly against the rabbit's enclosure. The animal's feces and urine may contaminate the hay and storing it in this
manner provides a haven for vermin. This loose hay needs to be stored properly to protect it from contamination
and to prevent it from attracting vermin.
There is a gasoline powered lawn mower stored in the rabbit housing area. This may not be kept in the same area
as the rabbits. Gasoline and/or oil could leak from the mower and go into the rabbit's enclosures. The lawn mower
must be moved from the animal's housing area.
