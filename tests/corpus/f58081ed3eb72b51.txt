HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
I was notified through email, by the facility, that two of the Red Fox had escaped during repairs to the liner in the
pond, of the fox exhibit. The foxes panicked and climbed over the fence. The large equipment, being brought into
the enclosure, with the animals still present, created panic in the animals resulting in the escape. The animals
should have been moved to an appropriate area while this work was being done to not have created behavioral
stress to the foxes. Handling of all animals should be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner
that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort. At the time of this inspection, one of the animals has been caught, and the other is still at large.
Corrected immediately.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two fox escaped their habitat enclosure when large equipment was brought into the fox area. The electric fence
had been turned off to facilitate the large equipment. Allowing the fox to remain within the the enclosure while the
work was being done and the electric fence not operational, the facility did not take the measures to ensure the
safety and security of the animals. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and be
maintained in good repair and working condition, to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals
securely.
Corrected immediately
No records were reviewed at the time of this inspection.
