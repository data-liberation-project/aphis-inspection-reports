PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
In October 2013 a rabbit was placed under anesthesia for a study procedure by the use of injectable than isoflurane
gas to maintain anesthesia. The staff member turned off the oxygen flow of the isoflurane anesthesia machine to
test the system but failed to restart the oxygen. After a short time period the staff member noticed and alerted a
supervisor, yet the animal could not be resuscitated. Corrective measures were taken, including but not limited to,
retraining of all involved staff and observation of techniques by veterinary staff. This incident has not recurred.
This item has been corrected by the facility.
An exit briefing was conducted on site with facility personnel.
