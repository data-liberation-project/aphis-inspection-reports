This was a focused inspection on veterinary care. No non-compliant items were identified during this inspection.
The animals are receiving appropriate veterinary care, as of the time of inspection, and the facility is working with
the attending veterinarian on a written plan, currently in draft, which will serve as an agreement regarding daily
assessment of Koko, and when a medical intervention may be required.
An exit interview occurred with keepers at the facility following the inspection on 8/3/17, and again on 8/8/17 by
phone with the Associate Director of Research and Care, following a phone consultation with the attending
veterinarian on 8/7/17.
