PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
According to record review, October 25, 2016, male domestic short-haired cat, ID #16CFK5, on IACUC approved
protocol #4344 was mistakenly identified by research lab personnel as being on another IACUC approved protocol
#4522. These two IACUC approved protocols are under the same principal investigator (PI). The animal was
inadvertently humanely euthanized following the IACUC approved procedures of protocol #4522. The error was
discovered by research lab personnel during the harvesting procedures. Research personnel notified the clinical
veterinarian. The attending veterinarian and IACUC chairperson were also notified.
Facility must ensure that personnel are adequately trained and proficient in following the proper pre-procedural care
of the animals.
Research personnel documented the animal’s disposition in the records. All the procedures performed were
included on at least one of the two IACUC approved protocols. The PI was able to utilize the animal for both studies.
The registrant investigated the incident and implemented effective corrective actions. There has not been any
further occurrence.
This inspection was conducted July 19-21, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
