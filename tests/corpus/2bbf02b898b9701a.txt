Protocols FDV 100614-00 and FDV120315-00 both involve procedures that cause more than momentary pain and
distress. The principal investigator has explained the purpose of these procedures but has not provided a detailed
narrative describing the methods and sources used to determine that no alternatives to the painful/distressful
procedure are available. Failure to consider alternatives may lead to unnecessary pain. The IACUC must ensure
that the PI has considered alternatives to procedures that cause pain or distress and has provided a written
narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available. Correct
prior to the use of animals on these protocols.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocols FDV12114-00, FDV120314-00 and FDV021115-00 give no rationale for the number of animals to be
used. They simply state the number of animals that will be used in each treatment group. A protocol must contain a
rationale for the number of animals to be used to allow the IACUC to ensure there is no duplication thus limiting the
use of animals and that there is minimalization of animal distress and pain. All protocols must include a rationale for
involving animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers of animals to be used. Correct prior to
any use of animals on the protocols.
2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol FDV100614-00 involves procedures that cause unrelieved pain and distress to the animals. The protocol
does not state or describe a specific endpoint that will be used to terminate the study and/or be the basis for when
euthanasia will be performed although it does describe a general vague endpoint rationale. Review of animal
records show that euthanasia was not performed in one ferret (752) yet was performed in others (594,754) showing
symptoms. The clinical symptoms used as endpoints did not appear consistent in basis or in the timing of
euthanasia between the animals. Lack of a specific specified endpoint may lead to unnecessary pain and/ordistress. A protocol must contain a description of the procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to
animals will be limited. Correct prior to the use of additional animals on this protocol.
