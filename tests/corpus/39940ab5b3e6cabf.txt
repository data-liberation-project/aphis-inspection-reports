2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult pot-bellied pig named "Chops" repeatedly chomped his jaws and produced a blood-tinged foamy saliva
from his mouth. A facility representative stated that he had noticed a small amount of blood-tinged foam coming
from the pig's mouth for the past 1-2 weeks; however, the pig was not receiving veterinary care for the condition.
Blood present in the mouth can indicate an injury or a dental problem that can be painful and can interfere with the
animal's ability to eat. The pig also had excessively long hooves that needed to be trimmed. Excessively long
hooves can be painful, can interfere with the animal's ability to walk normally, and can progress to other leg
problems. The licensee must have this pig examined by a veterinarian and treated appropriately and must provide a
record of treatment to the inspector upon request.
TO BE COMPLETED BY MARCH 31, 2014.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The acquisition records of the dogs and cats provided during the inspection were incomplete. The licensee is using
microchips as the method of animal identification; however, none of the corresponding microchip numbers were
recorded on the acquisition records. Several of the sources from which the dogs and cats were acquired did not
have complete addresses. Several of the animals listed on the acquisition records were retired and no longer
exhibited at the facility or had died, but continued to be listed on the acquisition records. Properly completed
acquisition records are necessary for identification of dogs and cats and to verify ownership. The licensee must
update the Record of Acquisition and maintain the record on a regular basis so that it always has accurate
information regarding acquisition, identification, and disposition for all dogs and cats.
TO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 1, 2014.
The inspection was performed on March 25 and the exit briefing was performed with a facility representative on
March 26, 2014.Additional Inspectors
