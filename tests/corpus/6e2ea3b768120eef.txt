2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Although the licensee has a written Program of Veterinary Care, the Attending Veterinarian is not always being
consulted for animal diseases, injuries, parasite prevention and treatment. The veterinarians advice is not always
being followed nor suggestions implemented. During the last two years, records at the veterinarians office indicate,
besides health certificates written for animal shipments, the few animals seen were for emergency treatments.
Items on the October, 2013 annual veterinary visit report which the veterinarian recommended, but which were not
implemented include: having a veterinary assistant review fecal parasite identification techniques, consulting the
state parasitology department in a parasite control program, rechecking certain animals' blood work, euthanasia of a
bull due to poor quality of life (this bull was transferred to another facility), provide cold storage of food. The
licensee needs to follow the recommendations of the Attending Veterinarian. To be corrected by 2-28-14.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An addax has an injured right eye which employees were treating the last few weeks. Although a call was made to
the veterinarian when the animal's initial injury was discovered, and medication was started, the animal was not
taken in for an exam and the condition still exists. The eye is not distinguishable and a large amount of serous &
mucoid discharges are draining from it. Ocular injuries frequently cause pain and this animal should have been
seen by the veterinarian for re-evaluation and treatment. This animal still needs to be seen by the veterinarian.
A wolf/dog hybrid was obtained this past summer and over the next several months, the licensee reported observing
it have at least three seizures. The veterinarian was not consulted about this animal, no examination was
conducted and on 1-2-14, it was found dying and was euthanized.
This past October, a Patagonian cavy was found non-responsive in the exhibit. According to the records, the
animal was taken to the primate barn and given fluids, dewormer, and antibiotics by a caretaker without consultation
with the veterinarian. The next day it was dead. Due to the seriousness of this condition, this animal should have
been taken to the veterinarian when first found.
The chimps were diagnosed in January 2013 with whipworms and were dewormed for 5 days with Panacur. InSeptember 2013 they were diagnosed with whipworms again and received the same course of treatment. This
treatment was performed without consultation with the attending veterinarian. These primates need to be
dewormed again after the initial course of deworming. Licensee needs to consult with the veterinarian on the proper
deworming schedules for this parasite to prevent reinfections.
Although there is a written Program of Veterinary Care, most of it is not being followed. The large cats were last
vaccinated over a year ago. The non-human primates have never been vaccinated. Annual physical exams are
not being done on the non-human primates and the dental care is not being provided as recommended by the
veterinarian.
At least two of the ibex are in need of foot trims, including one female with a slight limp on her right foreleg. Three
bottles of out of date antibiotics are in the fridge at the ibex barn. Expired medications are considered adulterated
and not an appropriate method to prevent, control, or treat diseases & injuries.
Veterinary care at this facility is not adequate as evidenced by the above items. Appropriate and adequate
veterinary care needs to be provided.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Daily Observation: Not all animals are being observed on a daily basis to assess their health and well being. An
apparently newborn goat was found dead and half eaten in a stall in the testing barn. All animals shall be observed
daily. Pregnant animals should be closely observed especially during cold weather and placed where newborns
can better survive. To be corrected immediately.
3.75(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste Disposal: The large metal trash barrel in the primate barn is mostly full with wastes and there is no lid on it.
Trash containers in food prep areas must be leakproof and have tightly fitted lids on them at all times to minimize
flies and vermin. To be corrected by 2-7-14.
3.76(c)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Lighting: The lighting in the primate barn is inadequate to see inside of the enclosures. A flashlight has to be used
to adequately see the animals inside many of the enclosures. The middle aisleway is adequately lit, but this light
does not project well into the animal's enclosures. Lack of uniformly diffused lighting makes maintaining good
housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning, and adequate inspection of animals difficult and does not provide for
the well-being of the animals. The lighting needs to be improved so that the animals and their enclosures are easyto observe. To be corrected by 2-28-14.
3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Environmental Enrichment: The Plan for Environmental Enhancement of Nonhuman Primates for the facility is not
being followed. Due to cold weather, the primates are spending the majority of time indoors in the heated barn.
There is very little detail in the plan to provide guidance to the caretakers on what types of enrichments are to be
provided. The plan states since space is more restrictive we plan to constantly incorporate sources of activity
exercise and mental challenge and added personal contact by the keepers. There is no supply of items to be
provided as enrichment. Almost no toys are in the enclosures, and no mentally challenging items are in storage or
use. The solitary baboon has a perch and a tire. The two capuchins have a tire and a ladder. The two mangabys
have one hanging ladder. The brown lemurs have been provided more climbing and hiding structures, but the other
non-human primates have very little structures in these back up areas. During the inspection of this area, the
primates did not seem to be interested in any these enrichments. The program needs to provide more details and
guidance as well as additional species specific environmental enrichments. To be corrected by 2-28-14.
3.81(c)(5)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
This facility has 3 chimpanzees, but there is very little in the Environmental Enhancement Plan which addresses
special considerations for these animals greater cognitive abilities. The plan states TV, videos, and radio systems
are installed for the Great Apes in the winter months, but these are not being provided. Chimpanzees nest build but
there are not enough clean blankets being provided for them to build nests. Due to cold weather, they are mostly
indoors and inside the two concrete enclosures are 2 platforms, 1 ball, one hanging tire, one mirror, and a bucket lid
for foraging when in use. There are no items specifically for the skills of chimpanzees. The enrichment plan
needs to provide more guidance on items and methods of providing enrichment to great apes and the employees
need to be trained in the needs of these primates. To be corrected by 3-28-14.
3.81(e)(1)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Exemptions: One female baboon is no longer paired and is housed alone during this inspection. The attending
veterinarian has not exempted this nonhuman primate from participation in the environment enhancement plan
because of its health or condition, or in consideration of its well-being. If this non-human primate is exempted, the
basis of the exemption must be recorded by the attending veterinarian and unless the basis for the exemption is a
permanent condition, the exemption must be reviewed and approved at least every 30 days by the attending
veterinarian. To be corrected by 2-28-14.3.82
FEEDING.
During this inspection, the table in the primate building holding boxes and bags of fruits and vegetables, also had a
box filled with straw serving as a cat bed sitting on the food table, with poured cat food directly on the table next to
the food. A cat was observed lying on top of oranges in a box on the table. This arrangement does not adequately
protect the food from potential contamination and the cat needs to be housed and fed separately from the food
storage. To be corrected by 2-7-14.
3.85
EMPLOYEES.
At least three employees rotate working in the primate area. There are 17 non-human primates including 3
chimpanzees, 3 baboons, 2 capuchins, 2 mangabys, and 7 lemurs. It does not appear the employees have
received adequate training in primate behaviors and in methods of providing enrichment. The employees have not
read the written environmental enrichment program, nor reviewed the collection of enrichment articles. To be
corrected by 2-28-14.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength. A piece of 4X4 metal wire is bent up and protruding inside the shift chute for the cougar Cricket.
The wood board at the base of the entrance is rotted. A wood support board at the top corner of Cricket's den is
rotted where it attaches the metal roof. The corner support for the gate at the back of the enclosure with six addax
is so loose it can be swayed several feet. This also causes a gap in the gate. The other corner post is also loose
and there are multiple broken support posts and broken or loose top boards attached to the chain link fence
separating the addax from the aoudad and ibex enclosures. The addax shelter to the right has a plywood board at
the back which is pushed out leaving a gap at the edge and this board also has three protruding nails. The bear
pen on the right is 6 foot chain link with two strands of thick black wire above that. At the front left side the black
wires are missing or loose leaving a 2.5 foot gap. There are several protruding nail points on the back of the USDA
barn.
Five tiger and lion enclosures have enclosure fences with need additional fencing at the tops. In some areas, the
fence height was raised by using high tensile wires. These wires are a minimum of a foot apart and in places there
are larger gaps. This fencing needs to be more substantial and secure. There are also one foot gaps over the
equipment entrance gates into two of the big cat enclosures. These gaps need to be closed. Some crape myrtle
trees are growing too close and through the enclosure fence for the two leopards, providing potential climbing
escape. These trees need to be pruned back to a safe height. Chain link wire is loose and protruding into the gap
being used for feeding one of the tigers in a back up area.
The shift chute for the bear den on the far left of the waterfall bears has chainlink which no longer secure along thebottom of one side where a cable broke, and a vertical tension bar has been pulled out and bent into the chute area.
All of the above items need to be repaired or replaced to prevent potential injury and to contain the animals.
Structures requiring repairs need to be reported to the appropriate person on a timely basis. Above items to be
corrected by 3-21-14.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a large puddle and muddy wet area in front of the gate leading to the shelter for the two elands. This area
needs to drain more quickly so that the animals do not have to walk though it to gain access to their shelter. To be
corrected by 2-21-14.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter Fence: The 8 foot chain link perimeter fence is pushed over halfway down by tree deadfall along a ten
foot piece in the brushy area behind the large cat dens. This area along the fence line needs to be cleared so that
regular checks and maintenance of the fence can be done. In the safari area, there are several double gates in the
fence which are not 8 feet tall. One of these gates located near the rhinoceros enclosure measures between 6 foot
3 inches to 6 foot 8 inches. This gate was also found open during this inspection, as were the entrance gates for
the safari buses which are not running at this time. Because the park is closed at this time of year, all gates which
make up part of the perimeter fence need to remain closed to contain any animals and prevent unwanted animals
&/or people from entering the park. To be corrected by 2-28-14
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The walk in freezer is in disarray with boxes stacked and tossed throughout. There is a gap at the base of the
freezer at the back and condensation is forming large ice mounds on some of the boxes of food and on the fan
blowers. Dead animals are in the freezer, some for taxidermy, some to be used as food, and at least two parrots
dead of unknown causes. Dead animals should be stored separately from all packaged food if the cause of death
is not known. The freezer needs to be organized and cleaned. The band saw outside of the freezer is dirty and
needs to be cleaned on a regular basis.
Although most dry food has been moved out of it, the old elephant barn still has stored boxed crackers which were
used during the lights display. At least three feral cats were seen and a pile of cat feces was in one area, near
some torn open bags of oyster crackers. This method of storage does not [protect the food from contamination.
Mineral blocks are provided in several areas, but these are placed on the ground. To prevent contamination, these
should be placed in some type of container. All above items to be corrected by 2-28-14.3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The large felids supplement is not being given according to the approved feeding plan. Calculations demonstrated,
and an employee stated that he was not giving the prescribed veterinary recommended daily amount to each cat.
The container was dirty, moldy and the powder was hard and not granular. The vitamin-mineral supplementation
shall be given as per the veterinarian approved feeding plan for the health and well-being of the felids. To be
corrected by 2-14-14.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures. There is an excess accumulation of old (ash colored) and fresh feces in the two cougar
enclosures, each with one cougar. One of the cougars has raked 6 piles of covered feces. The barn for the three
yaks has an excessive number of fecal piles. The enclosure with one tiger and one lion also has an empty concrete
pool with large amounts of ash colored feces in it. Additionally, there are fecal piles and food wastes in this
enclosure. There were at least 30 fecal droppings in the enclosure with two leopards. There were many rotting
carcass pieces in the lion Kobis enclosure along with a pile of feces. One tiger was locked in a backup pen for the
"family tiger" enclosure and the concrete floor also has old white chalky feces and urine soaked straw. One stall in
the testing barn has a dirt floor covered with a layer of goat feces. Feces needs to be picked up on a regular basis
to prevent excess accumulations, provide a clean surface to walk and lie down on, and to reduce disease hazards,
pests, and odors.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping: Facility grounds are littered with trash, plastic bags, old bones, plastic gloves, other equipment and
debris. A rotting meat odor was detected in the area behind the big cats' back up dens, and a rotted calf (initially
fed to the cats) was found tossed in the woods behind this area.
Accumulations of these types of materials, old food, plastics and other debris can harbor vermin which are known to
be at this facility. Materials can also blow into an enclosure and potentailly cause an animal to ingest harmful
materials. All areas need ot be to be kept clean to facilitate the husbandry practices, reduce odors, and cleared as
necessary to protect the health of the animals.
To be corrected by 2-28-14.
3.132
EMPLOYEES. There are not a sufficient number of adequately trained employees at this facility to maintain the professionally
acceptable level of husbandry practices required by the standards. This is evidenced by citations on this report and
chronic non-compliances in the areas of cleaning and veterinary care. There also does not appear to be adequate
training and supervision of the employees as evidenced by the low level of husbandry and housekeeping. There are
4 full time animal care employees, and 3 part time animal care employees at this facility. The facility has 17
non-human primates, including 3 chimps, 11 bears, 12 large cats, 20 camelids, 2 zebra, 32 bovine, at least 178
deer, 56 goats, 61 ibex and tahrs, 15 sheep, 2 eland, 7 addax, 1 rhinoceros, and a collection of exotic birds for a
total of over 414 animals. There needs to be enough employees to provide for adequate & thorough cleaning of all
enclosures, feeding, enrichment activities, and maintenance and repair structural items, as well as to provide other
husbandry and housekeeping practices. To be corrected by 3-28-14.
