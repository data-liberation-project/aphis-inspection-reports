ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Blood is collected from macaques at two week intervals to provide blood products to customers. A written standard
operating procedure is in place at this site which states that no more than 10% of the total circulating blood volume
of 65 ml/kg will be taken at each two week interval. Bleeding records for 141 primates over a period of three
months were reviewed. Of the 812 bleedings during this time frame, at least 73 times the blood amounts removed
were more than the 10% of blood volume. The excess amounts were closer to 1% of body weight. One primate
was bled 10 ml more than 1% of his body weight.
Hematocrits are taken at each bleed time and any animal with a hematocrit below 35 is not bled. Hematocrits
appear to be remaining within normal ranges for most of these primates, with occasional non-bleeds due to lower
hematocrits. At each bleeding iron and B vitamins are supplemented. Two older primates were euthanized during
this time frame due to continued low hematocrits.
To assure continued health of the animals, additional blood parameter testing may be needed to determine the
primate’s blood is being regenerated appropriately. The written standard operating procedure is to be followed.
To be corrected by 2-13-17.
