INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A room used for survival surgery on rabbits has items stored in it which are not related to the surgery, and are not
readily cleanable nor sanitizable. Items include a large wooden box and a large metal cabinet holding items in
drawers and on top that are simply stored there and are unrelated to the covered surgeries. These items include an
open cardboard box containing water bottles and other miscellaneous items, a radio, and items related to other
studies on non-covered animals.
Surgery on covered species must be conducted in dedicated facilities intended for that purpose which shall be
operated and maintained under aseptic conditions. Storage of unnecessary items in the surgery room is not
maintaining the room under aseptic conditions.
Correct by removing all extraneous items and maintaining the surgery room under aseptic conditions from now on.

Additionally, a sink in the animal prep area is being used as the surgeon's scrub sink. The water controls are not
hands-free, the faucet is low, and there is not much clearance between the faucet and the back of the sink. It would
be very difficult to assure proper surgeon hand scrub with this sink. A proper scrub sink away from the animals prep
area is recommended.
The inspection was conducted on September 15-16, 2015 accompanied by facility personnel.
The exit briefing was conducted on September 16, 2015 with facility personnel.
