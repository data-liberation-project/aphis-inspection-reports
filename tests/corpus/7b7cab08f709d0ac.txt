2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female poodle (057581320) was observed to be excessively licking her mouth and the hair around the front of her
mouth had become wet. Closer observation of the dog revealed at least one loose upper front tooth that was easily
moved when touched by the inspector. The surfaces of the check teeth are covered in a grey/brown material and
there is a grey creamy substance along the gum line. Approximately one-fourth of the surface of the upper canine
teeth and the majority of the surface of the upper front teeth are also covered in the grey/brown material. The gums
are moderately reddened. Poor dental health can cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to further
health complications.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The diagnosis and
treatment plan must be documented and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all
dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
A female Chihuahua (0A02552969) has extremely long, overgrown toenails. The toenails have become so long that
they have begun to curl under. Overgrown toenails can cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as affect the
dog's natural gait.
The licensee must have this dog's toenails trimmed to an acceptable length. The licensee must establish an
effective plan for the maintenance and care of the toenails of all dogs to ensure that they are kept at an acceptable
length at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure, containing one adult dog and two puppies, there is a heat lamp that has become detached from
the enclosure and is lying on the floor of the enclosure. The heat lamp contains a glass bulb and is plugged in and
turned on while lying on the floor. A puppy is lying near the heat lamp and the adult dog is moving around the heat
lamp. Heat lamps and glass bulbs that can come into contact with the dogs can result in injury and burns. Thelicensee reattached the heat lamp to the top of the enclosure during the inspection.
Another enclosure, containing one adult dog, has a heat lamp cord that is attached to the top of the interior of the
enclosure. The cord is attached with wire and the wire has become detached from the enclosure top and the cord is
hanging down into the enclosure. The wire still wrapped around the cord has created a sharp point that can come
into contact with the dog.

One enclosure, containing one adult dog and two puppies, has a small section of wire that has been cut and placed
against the whelping box to keep it from moving. The cut section of wire has resulted in multiple sharp points at the
level of the dog and puppies.

One enclosure, containing three dogs, has a broken piece of metal framing that is directly beneath the access door.
The broken metal has resulted in jagged edges and sharp points that the dogs could come into contact with when
they move through the access door.
Sharp points and jagged edges could cause injury to the dogs. Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and
constructed so that they protect the animals from injury. The licensee must repair, replace, or alter the sharp points
and jagged edges in a manner that eliminates the injury risk towards the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures remain safe for the animals at all times.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One enclosure, containing three dogs, has a plastic feeder attached to the wall. The dogs have excessively chewed
the top and bottom of this feeder and the sides of the feeder are extensively scratched.

Another enclosure, containing four dogs, has plastic covering the walls of the indoor section of the enclosure. The
dogs have excessively chewed and torn the plastic above the access door. The damaged plastic has created a
section of exposed wood and the dogs have begun chewing on the wood.

One enclosure, containing two dogs, has plastic covering the inside of the shelter. The dogs have excessively
chewed and torn the plastic that is framing the access door of the shelter.
Chewed and damaged surfaces cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces must be maintained on a
regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when they are worn or
soiled. The licensee must replace the chewed and damaged surfaces or alter them in a manner that allows for
adequate cleaning and sanitizing to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are kept in good repair at all
times. Correction date: May 18, 2016
3.6(a)(2)(10) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In one enclosure two small puppies were observed to be out of their whelping box and lying on the wire floor. One
puppy's right front leg has passed through an opening in the floor and the puppy was seen to struggle in an attempt
to move. Openings in the flooring that are large enough to allow an animal's leg to pass through can cause injury to
the animal.
Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury and do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through openings in the floor. The licensee must replace the flooring
or alter it in a manner that does not allow the puppy's feet or legs to pass through. The licensee must ensure that
the enclosure flooring is safe for the dogs at all times. The licensee moved both puppies back into the whelping box
during the inspection.
