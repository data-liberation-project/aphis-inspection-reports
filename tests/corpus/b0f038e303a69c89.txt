ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** Within an outdoor enclosure housing a male Great Pyrenees (no identification), there were several piles of
loose brown fecal material and no solid stools observed on the ground. According to the licensee, the loose stools
had not been noticed. The licensee stated she thought it was weather related due to the temperature. Abnormal
stools can occur as the result of parasites, infectious diseases or a variety of other veterinary medical problems.
***There was an adult female Boxer (ID # 010 815-067), which was nursing eight puppies approximately 3 1/2
weeks of age, who was very thin. The dog's ribs, spine and hip bones were easily visualized from a distance. At the
time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted regarding this dog(cid:25)s condition nor was the dog
receiving treatment for it. Poor body condition in dogs can be due to inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other
underlying medical problems.
The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding these animals(cid:25) conditions in order to ensure that
accurate diagnoses are obtained and appropriate treatment plans are developed. The licensee must ensure that the
treatment plans are followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

*** There was a bottle of "Gentamicin" within the small breed whelping building that was past the labeled expiration
date of 6/2014. This medication is currently stored with other medications at the facility and is therefore ready for
use. The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary
practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected
results when expired drugs are administrated could or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that
all medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date.
This item was corrected during the inspection.3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f) Drainage and waste disposal.
***Multiple enclosures at the facility have bones with small pieces of meat and bone marrow still attached. The
licensee collects the bones from the enclosures and places them in open buckets and on the ground within a few
feet of the outdoor enclosures by the whelping facility, the bones were attracting flies that can harbor disease. The
licensee only disposes of the waste about once a week. Disposal of food waste must minimize vermin and pest
infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. Housing facility operators must provide for regular and frequent
collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements
***In one outdoor enclosure, containing one Golden Retriever a hole had been dug in the back corner of the pen
exposing sharp points at the bottom of the fence, the points had dog hair attached. Another enclosure containing
one
dog had a feeder top with sharp edges directly above the feed trough. An additional enclosure had a wire protruding
from the ground and sticking into the enclosure. This item corrected at the time of the inspection. Sharp points
and edges that are protruding toward the animals may increase the risk of injuries. The licensee must ensure that
primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the
animals.
