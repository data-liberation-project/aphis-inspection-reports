3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On 5/7/2021 the facility found that overnight two striped hyenas had broken the welds on gates in their enclosure, gaining
access to a third striped hyena. The third hyena was visually assessed by the veterinarian, who believed further treatment
was not necessary, as only a few superficial lacerations were visible and the animal's demeanor was not abnormal.
Unfortunately the animal died three days later, and necropsy showed extensive deep tissue damage.

Enclosures must be appropriate for the species, and have adequate structural strength and integrity to contain the
animals. Following this incident, the facility has made extensive improvements to strengthen and enhance the hyena
enclosures. Facility must ensure that all animal enclosures have adequate structural strength from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
