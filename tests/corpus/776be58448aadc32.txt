INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
*** The IACUC has not conducted an inspection of all animal facilities at least every six months. A full inspection of
facilities and review of the program of humane care and use occurred on May 16, 2014. The next facilities
inspection and review of the program of humane care and use was conducted by the IACUC on December 14,
2014, which is greater than six months since the last inspection.
Inspection of the animal facilities by the IACUC is required at least every six months to ensure that any activities
involving animals at these facilities are being conducted in a manner to reduce pain and/or distress and they meet
the current standards for all species.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research
facility's animal facilities, including animal study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A- Animal Welfare, as a
basis for evaluation.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***There are 3 primary enclosures that do not have elevated resting surfaces to accommodate all the cats in the
enclosure. The use of elevated resting surfaces satisfies a behavioral preference for many cats. The licensee must
ensure that each primary enclosure housing cats must contain a resting surface or surfaces that, in the aggregate,
are large enough to hold all the occupants of the primary enclosure at the same time comfortably. The resting
surfaces must be elevated, impervious to moisture, and be able to be easily cleaned and sanitized, or easily
replaced when soiled or worn.
