2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Several rabbits were suffering from untreated and unobserved medical conditions. Two rabbits had ruptured abscesses
around their heads, while 2 other rabbits had swellings consistent with unruptured abscesses. Three rabbits had
reddened, squinting eyes with heavy discharge. Two rabbits had large swollen nipples that had turned black. Two rabbits
had large sores on their hocks so that they were reluctant to move. One rabbit had a head tilt and was circling. One rabbit
had protruding teeth and was not eating. All of these conditions are chronic in nature but had not been noted by the
licensee or his employees. When conditions go unidentified, treatment is delayed and they can become more severe,
causing increased suffering, and even death in the animals. All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and
well-being and any problems promptly communicated with the veterinarian. Correct immediately.
3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Rabbit enclosures were in disrepair and not being maintained. Several enclosures had rusted or missing clips between
the walls and floors, causing the walls and floors to gape. The wire floors and walls were rusted and the wires were
broken and protruding. I counted 67 enclosures with broken wires protruding into enclosures, creating sharp points that
could injure the rabbits. Additionally, some of the gaps were large enough for kits and adult rabbits to move between


enclosures. Broken and gaping cages put rabbits at risk for injury from sharp points, leg entrapment, and fighting.
Additionally, rabbits that can escape their enclosures may become lost and killed. Correct by ensuring all enclosures are
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain and protect the rabbits. Correct by June 30th.
