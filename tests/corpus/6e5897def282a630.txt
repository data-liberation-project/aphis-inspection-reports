3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
At least 80% of the self feeders have excessive chew damage present around the rim of the trough area. There are 2
enclosures utilizing a piece of plastic to maintain a whelping area that had excessive chew damage. This has led to
multiple jagged edges around these fixtures causing them to be unable to be readily cleaned and sanitized. Jagged edges
can also potentially cause injury to the dogs.

At least 80% of the primary enclosures that contained carpets used for whelping mats had frayed edges and were
excessively worn. Frayed edges can be potentially injurious to the dogs whether ingested or if they were to wrap around
the extremities. Ensure that all surfaces in contact with the dogs can be readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced when
worn or soiled. Correct by Jan 24th 2022.
3.10(a)

Watering
There are a total of 3 outdoor enclosures at this facility, housing a total of 13 dogs, that had water receptacles which
contained an approximate 2 inch layer of ice at the top of the bowl. The facility representative stated she put fresh water in
them this morning but due to local temperatures the water had already frozen. Without continuous access to water the


dogs are at risk of dehydration which can lead to other medical issues. Ensure potable water be continuously available to
the dogs. Correct by Jan 11th 2022.
