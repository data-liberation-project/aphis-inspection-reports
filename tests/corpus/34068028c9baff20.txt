2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
In March, 2016, laboratory staff inadvertently placed an NHP into an enrichment enclosure that was already
occupied by another NHP. Clinical Veterinarians responded immediately and both NHPs were evaluated for
injuries. One NHP received a minor injury and the other NHP sustained lacerations requiring suturing. Both animals
made full recoveries.
Per this section of the regulations, handling of animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress or physical harm.
In response to this incident, the IACUC and Clinical Veterinarians promptly provided additional training to all NHP
laboratory staff and implemented additional safety procedures to mitigate the possibility of a recurrence. No new
incidents have been reported. This incident is considered corrected.
This inspection occurred on August 3 and 4, 2016. Exit interview conducted with facility representatives and Drs.
Paula Gladue and Mary Ann McBride.
