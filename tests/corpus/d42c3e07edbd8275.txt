ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:45 on
16-Nov-16.
The licensee's wife was home and called the licensee at work. He was scheduled to be working late that day and
would not be available to accompany the inspector within an hour of the attempted time. The licensee prefers to be
present himself during the inspection; however, optimal hours and additional contact methods have been
established for this time forward.
