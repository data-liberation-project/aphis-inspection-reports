FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
***Three wolves have dug under the chain link fence which separates them from an enclosure housing three wolf
hybrids. This has created a hole large enough that allowed the wolves to enter into the wolf hybrids' enclosure. The
enclosures no longer contain the animals securely and the wolves and wolf hybrids could have compatibility issues.
This could increase the risk of injury to the animals. The licensee must fix the hole in the chain link fence to contain
the animals securely and prevent injury to the animals.
***Iniside the coatimundi enclosure, housing 2 coatimundis, there is a plastic child's toy that has an approximately 1
foot crack in the plastic and a hole approximately 4 inches in diameter. This crack and hole on the plastic child's toy
is located where the animals could walk. This could increase the risk of injury to the animals and is no longer
structurally sound. The licensee must repair or replace this structure to prevent injury to the animals.
The licensee must ensure that all housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and to contain the animals at all tiimes.

WATERING.
There were several enclosures throughout the facility which had water receptacles that did not appear clean and/or
contained no water or contained water with debris.
***A stock tank for three tigers had a dark green algae-like substance along the inside surface of the tank. The
water inside of the tank appeared to be an abnormal green color and filled approximately 1/4 of the tank. A stock
tank provided for a tiger and a liger had a small amount of water covering the bottom. The water in the tank
appeared dark brown and murky-like. There was a greenish-brown colored material lining the inside bottom surface
of the tank. There were also two, approximately 3 gallon plastic water receptaces, which contained no potable
water, attached to the chain link fence in the tiger and liger enclosure. The inside bottom surface of both of these
water receptacles could be seen. One of the receptacles had a build up of bird droppings on its inside surface.
According to the licensee, the stock tanks within these enclosures were not used for drinking water during this timeof year. The three tigers did have an additional drinking water source available in their enclosure, however, the tiger
and liger, which were housed in a separate enlcosure, did not have any additional source of drinking water available
besides that within the stock tank.
***A cougar did not have any water in its enclosure during the inspection. A plastic bucket used as the water
receptacle was empty and lying on its side in the enclosure.
***The water within the rubber water receptacle for two foxes appeared partially frozen and contained an abundance
of debris. The debris appeared to consist of wood chips and hair which covered the majority of the water. Also, a
rubber water receptacle provided for two coatimundis contained a small amount of water at the bottom of the
receptacle. The water in the receptacle appeared dark and murky-like with debris floating in the water.
After pointing out the lack of water, water debris and water receptacles during the inspection, which started at
approximately 3:30pm, the licensees started filling the water receptacles with fresh water in the animals' enclosures
throughout the facility. According to the licensee, the water receptacles had last been filled with water the day
before inspection in the afternoon around 1pm. During the inspection, once the cougar received water, it
immediately began drinking water on and off from the bucket for at least one minute. Once the tiger and liger
received fresh water; they also immediately began drinking. The tiger was observed drinking water for
approximately 30 seconds continuously and the liger was observed drinking water for at least 2 minutes.
Lack of potable water can increase the risk of dehydration and other medical issues for the animals. The licensee
must ensure that all animals have access to clean, potable water as often as necessary for the health and comfort
of the animals. TO BE CORRECTED BY: This point forward. Note: The licensee filled the water receptacles with
fresh water for these animals during the inspection.
Water receptacles, which are not properly cleaned and sanitized, can harbor disease-causing organisms. This could
decrease the animal's acceptability of the water, as well as increase the risk of disease. The licensee must ensure
that all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary. TO BE CORRECTED BY: March 31, 2014
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
***There were tall mostly dead and dried weeds and grass adjacent to a portion of the wolves'and wolf hybrids'
enclosures. The weeds and grass reached at least 3-4 feet in height in these areas. Tall weeds and grass can
harbor insects, rodents and vermin which can increase the risk of disease in the animals. The licensee must keep
the premises clean and in good repair in order to protect the health of the animals and to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices at the facility at all times.
The inspection was conducted with the licensee. The exit interview was conducted on March 18, 2014 with the
licensee.Additional Inspectors
