2.33(a)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The research facility did not assure that the attending veterinarian had appropriate authority to ensure the provision
of adequate veterinary care for multiple piglets studied under Protocol 18-021.0 Version 4. The following procedures
were performed by the investigators on piglets experiencing health issues without consultation, approval, or
oversight of the attending veterinarian or designee:
Gas anesthesia was used to replace feeding tubes on 03/27/19 for piglet 1-3 and piglet 1-4.
Piglet 1-10 underwent gas anesthesia for replacement of a feeding tube on 03/25/19, 03/27/19, and 03/28/19.
Piglet 2-5 was given a blood transfusion on 04/15/19. This piglet died 1 hour later.
In addition, during a conversation with the attending veterinarian the attending veterinarian stated that one of the
clinical veterinarians observed one of the piglets in distress during her rounds. The clinical veterinarian directed the
investigators to euthanize the piglet immediately due to its poor condition and suffering. The investigator argued
with the clinical veterinarian and did not euthanize the piglet as directed.
Multiple instances occurred under Protocol 18-021.0 Version 4 involving piglets in which information on problems of
animal health were not communicated in a timely manner to the attending veterinarian or designee. The following
piglets exhibited acute health issues. A veterinarian was not contacted in any of these instances. In each case the
piglet died despite interventions initiated by the laboratory staff without veterinary input.
13 piglets were involved in Cohort 1, which began on 03/22/19. On 03/26/19, piglet 1-8 was observed to be weak
and lethargic. The piglet clinically deteriorated and died 3 hours later. On the evening of 03/23/19, piglet 1-13 was
observed to have poor circulation. The piglet died one hour later. On the evening of 03/23/19, piglet 1-7 was
observed to have poor circulation and weakness. The piglet died one hour later.
13 piglets were involved in Cohort 2, which began on 04/12/19. On the morning of 04/15/2019, piglet 2-5 was noted
to be lethargic and pale. The piglet was observed to have died 3 hours later. On the morning of 04/14/2019, piglet
2-10 was noted to have respiratory difficulty. In the mid-afternoon the piglet was observed to have severe difficulty
breathing. The animal died that evening. On the morning of 04/13/2019, piglet 2-8 was noted to have a weak pulseand respiration. The animal died 30 minutes later. On the evening of 04/13/2019, piglet 2-13 was observed to have
labored breathing. The animal was observed to be paddling and was discolored. The animal died 3 hours later.
The research facility shall assure that the attending veterinarian has authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care for animals in the protocol in order to minimize pain and distress and to improve health for the
research animals. The attending veterinarian has knowledge and expertise in the care and treatment of animals,
and must have the authority to recommend and require treatments as necessary to improve animal health and
prevent, address, and alleviate animal suffering.
This issue was identified and corrected prior to today's inspection. The protocol is no longer active.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian and facility representatives.
