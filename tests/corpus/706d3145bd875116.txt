3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure containing seven elk and three deer is constructed of woven wire fencing. A section of the cross
fence is damaged resulting in a large amount of the woven wire lying on the ground and broken wires are creating
sharp points around the damaged area of fencing. The condition of the ground around the affected fence section (a
muddy path) indicates that the animals are currently crossing through this damaged section of fencing to move
between the pastures.
Thick wire cables are wrapped around the base of one fence post and the loose ends of the wire cables are lying
across the ground within the animal enclosure. Also, lying on the ground near the wire cables is an unused steel
fence post and long wooden board.
The woven wire on one section of the cross fence was previously damaged and had been repaired, but at the time
of the inspection, numerous broken wires creating sharp points are located around the patched section.
Damaged fencing, loose wire cables, sharp points and unused materials within the enclosure could cause injury to
the animals.
The facility must be constructed of such material and such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
outdoor housing facility must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair and protect the animals from injury.
The facility must repair, replace, or alter the damaged cross fence in a manner that eliminates the injury risk towards
the animals. The facility must also remove the unused steel fence post and wooden board from the enclosure, as
well as, remove all sharp points and the loose wire cables. The facility must ensure that the enclosure fencing
remains in good repair and the enclosure remains free of unused materials at all times.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
