Facilities, general.
The following areas of enclosure fencing need repair:
* The gate to the exhibit camel enclosure has been pushed down on/compacted such that the height of the gate is less
than 3 feet tall. In addition, the top metal rail is broken in half in the center with the two halves having sharp edges. The
camels may injure themselves on the broken metal edges and could potentially step out over the gate as it is too low to
securely contain them.
*The enclosure for the pygmy goats includes a section of smaller wire fencing added to the existing livestock fencing to
keep the young kids from being able to get through the larger openings. One end has extra fencing material that extends
into the enclosure and a has sharp pointed cut edge. The goats may injure themselves on the sharp edge.
The outdoor housing facilities including the fencing and gates must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.

Sanitation.


The shelter boxes being used by a total of three coatimundi (two enclosures) need to be cleaned. The bedding material in
the shelter boxes contains several days worth of excreta that has not been removed. Fecal material was visible, the
bedding material was wet in half of the structure and an odor was detected. Excreta needs to be removed regularly to
prevent spread of disease, prevent contamination of the animals, and to reduce odors. Clean both shelter boxes and
replace the bedding material with clean litter then going forward remove excreta as often as necessary to prevent
accumulation of excreta.
