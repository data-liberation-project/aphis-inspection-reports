3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are eight plastic shelters being used by 14 dogs in the outdoor housing area that have a damaged or missing
wind and rain break. Dogs having little to no protection from the effects of wind, rain or snow blowing directly on
them could experience difficulty in conserving body heat. The licensee must ensure all outdoor shelter structures
have wind and rain breaks at all times for the health and well being of the dogs.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
