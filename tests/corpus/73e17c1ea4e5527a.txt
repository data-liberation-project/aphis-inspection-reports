Structural strength.
There were fourteen enclosures housing a total of nineteen ferrets in the nursery housing area where the smaller
wire mesh flooring placed on top of the existing wire mesh flooring have areas of broken wire with sharp points near
the back of the enclosures. These enclosures are not maintained in good repair and the sharp points could cause
injury to the ferrets. Remove sharp points by repairing or replacing these areas to protect the animals from injury.
