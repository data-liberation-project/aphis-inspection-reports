2.31(c)(3) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
After the facility’s last program review and facility inspection in October 2021, the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) failed to prepare and submit a report to the Institutional Official (IO) as required.
Failure of the IACUC to submit reports to the IO could prevent the IO from making corrective actions in program
deficiencies that are or could impact animal welfare.
The IACUC shall prepare reports of its evaluations and submit the reports to the IO. The reports must contain a
description of any deficiencies and contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each
deficiency.
Correct from this point forward.
2.31(d)(1)(iii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Upon review of the facility’s animal use protocol for the immunization of Rabbits for antibody production, a written
assurance that the activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments was not provided.
Failure to ensure that the proposed activities meet each of the requirements of the regulation could result in a negative
impact of the animals’ welfare.


Written assurance of the above requirement must be provided.

2.31(e)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Upon review of the facility’s animal use protocol for the immunization of Rabbits for antibody production, there is no
description of the approximate number of animals to be used. A rational for involving animals, and for the appropriateness
of the species and numbers of animals to be used is not provided. There isn’t a complete description of the proposed use
of the animals, and there isn’t a description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be
limited to that which, is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research.
Each protocol for animal use must contain all aspects of the cited regulation to allow the IACUC to fully understand and
adequately review the proposed activities.
Correct by April 30, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
