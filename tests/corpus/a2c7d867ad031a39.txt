SANITATION.
The cage containing 3 ferrets had a large amount of fecal material and debris present. The licensee stated it had
been about three weeks since the cage was last cleaned. Enclosures with a buildup of fecal material and debris can
create an environment for disease spread, contamination of the animals and excessive odors. The ferret enclosure
must be cleaned and a more frequent schedule of cleaning established and maintained. Correct by March 16, 2020.
