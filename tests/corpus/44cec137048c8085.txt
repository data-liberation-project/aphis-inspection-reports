*** The facility was currently using two expired drugs for parasite control. Additionally the 7-way vaccine was stored
in the fridge with the in use vaccines and was also expired. These drugs included: Pyrantel suspension (lot
504-1009) expired 10/13. 7-way vaccine (lot UV-131-038B) expired 11/11. Ivermectin expired 01/13. Expired drugs
should be discarded appropriately and not used for the health of the animals.
*** At least 50% of the dogs in the kennel had matted fur and long nails that need to be trimmed. Many of the mats
were underneath the neck and on the feet. Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin which can be painful and
cause skin irritations. In addition, long nails potentially get caught in the wire mesh. These dogs need to be groomed
on a routine basis to prevent this matting from occurring and for the comfort of the animals.
*** A Maltese identified as # 093541339 was shaking its head and when observed closer the ears were very dirty
with a high potential of ear mites. Additionally this dog had a large accumulation of tarter along the teeth. This dog
needs to have its ears treated and a dental plan for this animal needs to be in place as appropriate methods for
preventing and controlling these husbandry concerns.
*** A pug with an id chip that could not be located had the beginning of a "cherry eye" in the left eye and the right
eye appeared to have a film on it. This animal needs to be assessed by the vet to determine cause of the issues
and how best to treat the eyes.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A small white bichon housed with a dachshund was continuously circling in the enclosure for several minutes
during the inspection process. This occurred when the inspector was in front of the enclosure and continued as the
inspector walked down the aisle and looked back to see if the behavior stopped. The dog was co-housed and would
continue the behavior around the other dog in the enclosure. This is an abnormal behavior pattern for this animaland could be indicative of stress or another health issue. The licensee has not communicated this abnormal
behavior with the vet to address the issue. Daily observation of the animals should focus on their health and well-
being which would include their psychological well- being. The attending vet needs to evaluate this animal for
diagnosis of the cause of these behavior and develop an appropriate treatment plan to address this issue. Written
documentation the Attending Veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations regarding alterations to cage space or enrichment,
and any other steps necessary to address this abnormality shall be maintained by the licensee for review by APHIS
Officials. Additionally, the licensee shall maintain documentation of the implementation of these recommendations
for review.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** There are a few broken wires in an enclosure housing two cocker spaniels in the wire mesh floor. These wires
need to be replaced to keep the enclosure in good repair and for the safety of the dogs.
*** Some of the coating is coming off the wire mesh on the flooring in the first enclosure in the main kennel. In
addition several of the other enclosures have coating that is coming off the wire in the middle sections of the
enclosures. these areas of the wire are becoming rusted and once rusted they can no longer be effectively cleaned
and sanitized. These sections of wire need to be addressed throughout the kennel to keep the enclosures in good
repair and structurally sound.
*** Several of the rubber mats in the whelping boxes are bowing up into the box. These mats need to be replaced
before the next dam and litter are in the boxes to keep the enclosures in good repair.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The primary enclosures and food receptacles have not been sanitized since March according to the facility
records. There is a layer of grime underneath the lip of the feeders, an accumulation of hair and debris underneath
the main kennel and urine stains and grime along many of the base frames. These enclosures should be sanitized
at least once every two weeks to prevent this accumulation of dirt and debris. This needs to be addressed for the
health of the dogs.
