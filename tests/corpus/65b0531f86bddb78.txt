FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Within an outdoor enclosure housing 4 yaks, there were two large areas of tin along the backside of a shelter unit
that were in disrepair. These sections were a few feet in diameter and consisted of bent and twisted-like portions of
tin that were pulled away from the wall and created sharp points and/or edges that projected into the animals'
enclosure at their level. These sharp points and/or edges can increase the risk of injury to the animals. The licensee
must ensure that the housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury at all times. To be corrected by: October 9, 2017.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee on October 4, 2017.
