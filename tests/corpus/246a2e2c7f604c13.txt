3.8(a)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
*** In pen 97 there is a spaniel that measures 25 inches long. The dog requires 13 square feet of space to meet the
exercise requirement but is currently housed in an enclosure that is 11.42 square feet.
*** In pen 98 there is a Shar-pei that is 26 inches long . The dog requires 14 square feet of space to meet the
exercise requirement but is currently housed in an enclosure that is 11.56 square feet.
Both dogs need to be moved to enclosures that meet the exercise requirement or the exercise plan needs to
address these dogs and state the frequency and duration they will be provide the opportunity to exercise. This
needs to be addressed for the physical health of the dogs.
