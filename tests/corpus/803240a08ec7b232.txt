2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
According to the licensee, on or about May 9, 2022, a 3-week-old Siberian lynx kitten was sold and transported via
intermediate handler. Nondomestic cats of this age do not have a completely developed immune system and are unable
to fight off disease or infections and allowing them to be transported under four weeks of age puts them at risk for illness
or death. Nondomestic cats must be protected from harm by not releasing them for transport if they are 4 weeks (28 days)
or younger in age. Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
