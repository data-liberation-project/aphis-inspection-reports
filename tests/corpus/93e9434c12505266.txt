OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are two outdoor enclosures where the shade provided is not adequate for the three dogs housed in each.
Without protection from the direct rays of the sun, the dogs may become uncomfortably hot and may not be able to
maintain a safe body temperature. The licensee must ensure that outdoor facilities have one or more separate
outside areas of shade provided that are large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them from
the direct rays of the sun. To be corrected by 23 September 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
