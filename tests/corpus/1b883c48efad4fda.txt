ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Lesions were seen on two rabbits housed together in a wire enclosure:
-(cid:9)One rabbit, light grey in color, had an approximately 1 inch in diameter circular lesion on his lower back right above
his tail. The area around the lesion was hairless. The top skin layer was missing exposing pink tissue below. A
moderate amount of yellow crusty material could be seen coating the lesion.
-(cid:9)His cage mate, a tan and black rabbit, had a small circular white spot on the surface of his left eye. The skin
around the eye was hairless and slightly reddened.
The licensee had not identified the condition affecting these two rabbits, therefore had not contacted the
veterinarian for guidance on care. Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and
distress in animals with such conditions. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be
implemented in order to properly assess their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the
attending veterinarian is required for timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention. These two rabbits need to be
seen by a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
3 primary enclosures containing rabbits weighing within the 4.4 – 8.8 lbs. range were too small for the number of
rabbits contained therein:
-(cid:9)A wire enclosure housing 2 rabbits approximately 8 lbs. each per the facility representative measured 3 feet by 1.5
feet for a total of 4.5 square feet. Two rabbits of that size housed together require a minimum of 6 square feet
meaning that the enclosure was short 1.5 square feet.
-(cid:9)A wire enclosure housing 2 rabbits close to 8 lbs. each per the facility representative measured 2 feet by 1.5 feet
for a total of 3 square feet. Two rabbits of that size housed together require a minimum of 6 square feet meaning
that the enclosure was short 3 square feet.
-(cid:9)A wire enclosure housing 4 rabbits close to 8 lbs. each per the facility representative measured 3 feet by 2 feet fora total of 6 square feet. Four rabbits of that size housed together require a minimum of 12 square feet meaning that
the enclosure was short 6 square feet.
Failure to provide adequate space can result in increased aggression between cage mates, increased disease
transmission, and reduced animal welfare. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures containing rabbits have
enough floor space to meet the minimum floor space requirements for the number and the size of the rabbits in that
enclosure.
