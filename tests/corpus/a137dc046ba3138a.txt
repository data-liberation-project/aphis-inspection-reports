ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Mandy, a female Golden Retriever (m/c # 941000018993135), is very thin. Her ribs, backbone, hip bones and
shoulders are easily observed and there is a very defined abdominal tuck. Mandy has 9 puppies that are 2 weeks
old. The owners have been feeding her free choice dry puppy food and a can of puppy food in the morning and
evening. There was no consultation with a veterinarian to establish a diagnosis or to confirm that this was the
correct treatment for this dog. Poor body condition can be the result of parasites, inadequate nutrition, or an
underlying medical condition. Mandy must be evaluated by a veterinarian within 3 days of this inspection, to know
with certainty the problem and the correct treatment. Documentation of the evaluation, recommended treatment
and delivered treatments must be available to APHIS officials.
