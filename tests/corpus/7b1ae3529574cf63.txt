2.38(f)(1) REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
A male macaque underwent surgery on Dec 7, 2015 as part of protocol # YER2002598-040917GA. The macaque
recovered from surgery but within 3 days post-surgery became ill. Blood was collected for laboratory tests. Over the
next 4 days conservative measures and prophylactic treatment was administered. The macaque’s condition
worsened and the facility made the decision to euthanize the animal on Dec 14, 2015. The necropsy report
indicated that a piece of sterile gauze had been left in the abdomen during surgery causing adhesions and intestinal
obstruction. Failure to remove all surgical gauze resulted in illness and euthanasia of the macaque.
Appropriate corrective measures were instituted including the use of radio-opaque gauze and requiring a systematic
check to account for surgical sponges. The noncompliant item has been corrected.
Exit interview conducted with the Chief Compliance Officer and facility representatives.
