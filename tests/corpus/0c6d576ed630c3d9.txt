RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The inventory records of the facility have not been kept up to date by adding the dates of animals sold. There were
approximately 142 adults at the facility which were on the inventory, however there were an additional 77 animals
on the inventory that have been sold that have not had the dates entered on the records. There are 6 Disposition
forms that have duplicate sales of the same puppies to different pet stores, these records were not filled out
correctly.
It is important that all records of inventory, acquisition, disposition and births are kept up to date and accurate for
proper traceability and management of the regulated animals.
The licensee must update the inventory to include all of the dates of the animals that are no longer at the facility. All
puppy records and disposition forms must be complete and accurate with the proper ID numbers and buyer
information.
