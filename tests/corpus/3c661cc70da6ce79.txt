2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The Record of Disposition that is being utilized by the facility does not fully and correctly disclose the required
information. There were 15 off spring hedgehogs by different breeding females that had been sold. These off
springs were not properly identified on the documentation so they could not be accurately tracked. Maintaining
current records of animals on hand, including those acquired and disposed of, is required to accurately track the
movement of animals and to facilitate the inspection process.
Make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding the
acquisition and disposition of animals other than dogs and cats.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
