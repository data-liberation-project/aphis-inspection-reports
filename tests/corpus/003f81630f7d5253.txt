2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1235 on
14-Feb-17. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I called the licensee and left a message. I then honked
my car horn. A few minutes later the licensee called me back and informed me he was not available for inspection.
I told him we would try again another time.
End of report.
Additional Inspectors
Sime Debra, Veterinary Medical Officer
