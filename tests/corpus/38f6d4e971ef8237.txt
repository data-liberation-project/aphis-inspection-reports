2.31(e)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Review of Protocol 2022-005 showed that this protocol, as approved, does not contain a rationale for the appropriateness
of the number of lemurs to be used.

An animal use proposal must include a rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of animals to be used so that the
IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) can conduct a thorough review of the components of the activities
related to the care and use of animals and determine that the proposed activities are in accordance with the Animal
Welfare Act.

The IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) needs to address this deficiency and ensure all approved
protocols contain a rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of animals. Correct by September 13, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
