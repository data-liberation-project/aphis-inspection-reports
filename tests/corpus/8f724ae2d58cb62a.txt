3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surface - general requirements.
Some of the front metal enclosure panels in both housing areas have sections where the paint has come off and the
wire has rusted leaving a rough surface. The last pen in the main breeder building housing one Saint Bernard has a
metal frame holding the feeder that is rusted and a painted metal gate that has rusted where the paint has come off.
There are two metal frames that hold a food receptacle with excessive rust leaving a rough surface to the metal.
One food bucket is secured with metal ties that have excessive rust. These enclosures house a total of 12 dogs.
Areas with excessive rust particularly those where the rust has left a rough texture cannot be properly cleaned and
disinfected and the structural integrity of the surface may also be affected. These areas need to be addressed by
replacing, repainting or other appropriate method to eliminate the rust and allow for thorough cleaning and sanitizing
practices. Correct by November 1, 2016.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water receptacles.
The food and water receptacles are not being disinfected every 2 weeks as evidenced by the dark brown oily
buildup on them. Inadequate disinfecting increases disease hazards and allows for an accumulation of dirt and
other debris. Disinfect food and water receptacles at least once every two weeks to reduce these risks. Correct by
October 1, 2016.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control.
There was a large presence of flies throughout both kennel areas. The facility has a pest control plan in place that
includes fly tape and insecticide spray; however, due to the large presence of flies the plan does not appear to beeffective. Pests can bring in disease and affect the comfort of the dogs. The pest control plan needs to be
re-evaluated and adjusted so that insects are effectively controlled. Correct by October 1, 2016.
