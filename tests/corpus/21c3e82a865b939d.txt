Facilities, general.
The outdoor housing of 2 adult South American coati is not kept in good repair. The platform of an elevated wooden
resting surface is detached from one of the corners and has created a gap where the animals' feet or tail can get stuck. In
addition, the wire mesh fence on one side of the enclosure has come off creating an opening big enough that the animals'
nose and even face can fit through. These deficiencies can cause injury to the animal and an animal can potentially
escape its enclosure. Indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence surrounding the primary enclosures of 1 Virginia opossum, 1 ringtail and 1 North American porcupine
is not 6 feet tall. Any perimeter fence less than 6 feet high for non-dangerous animals must be approved in writing by
Administrator. A perimeter fence serves as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. The fence
must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from


going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility.
