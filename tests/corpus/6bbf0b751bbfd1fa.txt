Primary enclosures.
The floor of the rabbit cages consists of a 1”x1” wire mesh. The rabbits have been provided with an approximately
12”x12” piece of wood presumably to allow their feet some relief from the wire. Most of these wood pieces have been
chewed to almost half their original size indicating they have been in the cages for some time. They are also discolored
from excessive exposure to urine and feces.
Wood pieces that are contaminated with urine and feces are not adequate protection for rabbit feet. The bacteria from the
urine and feces can contribute to infections in feet already compromised from extended exposure to wire mesh. A more
appropriate method for protecting the rabbits’ feet and legs from the wire mesh and possible injury (one that can be easily
cleaned and replaced when soiled) needs to be provided.
