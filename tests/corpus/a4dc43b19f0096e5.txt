* One white adult female Poodle ( microchip number 105 864 000 ) is thin in appearance. When viewed from the
back and side, the ribs, backbone and hip bones could be easily felt. The licensee stated that the dog in question
was an older dog. At time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted. Body condition that
shows lost weight to the point that the backbone or ribs are visible is a sign of potential health problems. Poor body
condition could be an indication the dog is not receiving adequate nutrition or it could be internal problems. This
can affect the ability of the dog to gain or maintain its body weight. This dog must be examined by a licensed vet
and appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis
and treatments. All medical records must be made available to the inspector upon request. Correct by 6/9/15.

all other surfaces are free of rust and of good structural strength. Correct by 6/16/15.
