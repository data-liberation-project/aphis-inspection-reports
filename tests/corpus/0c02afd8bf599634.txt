HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Bottles & jugs of soaps & bleach were being stored in the dog/cat barn area in close proximity to the animal
enclosures. The bags of feed are being stored in an area accessible to barn cats who were observed next to the
bags of feed during the inspection. Other bottles of soaps were observed on the counter/sink area in the small air
conditioned food prep room.
These storage practices do not minimize contamination of the feed by these chemicals or the cat(s), and also poses
a risk of ingestion by the animal if these chemicals should spill out of their containers and get into the enclosures or
the animal feed/bedding
Storage of food must be stored in a manner that protects it from contamination. Substances that are know to be
toxic to the dogs or cats, but are required for the normal husbandry practices must not be stored in food storage and
preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the animal or prep areas.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
"Scooter" has been chewing/scratching the lower painted horizontal pieces of wood in two of the outdoor portions of
his sheltered housing that he has been in. This has created removal of the paint & splintering of this wood which
could potentially injure "Scooter" as he further works on these structures, or any other dog that might be placed in
either of these runs.
Enclosures must be maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs and protect
them from injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The camel enclosure only has one shelter structure which would accommodate 2 of the 4 adult camels. This shelter
structure is not large enough to allow all 4 camels to make normal postural adjustments (stand up, lie down & turn
around) if they were to seek shelter from the elements (sun, & rain) at the same time.
Additional shelter shall be provide so that all of the camels can be protected from the elements at the same time
while maintaining normal postural adjustments within.
