HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On the day of inspection on 8/1/14 the temperature reached 106 degrees F during the inspection. Many of the
felines were panting, and some appeared uncomfortably hot and lethargic. Apart from the bears and a small basin
for the fishing cat, there were no additional basins of water, besides drinking water, supplied in other enclosures.
Although the decks had been wetted around 1 PM, at 3 PM an infrared thermometer showed the surface
temperature of the decks to be around 127 degrees F. A Kestrel thermometer reading in the shade inside a typical
enclosure was 105 degrees F.
Measures should be undertaken to prevent overheating, and ensure the comfort of the animals. Measures could
include, but are not limited to, increased ventilation, fans, misters, pools, and/or frozen treats. Severely hot weather
can cause discomfort and threaten the health of the animals.
To be corrected immediately.
An exit interview was conducted with the animal exhibitor.
