Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee does not have a formal arrangement with an attending veterinarian, nor a written program of veterinary care.

It is important to have a formal arrangement and written program of veterinary care to protect the regulated animals at the
facility.

Each dealer and exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time
attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary
care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer or exhibitor.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a short-tailed opossum that has brown scabs covering the tips of both ears. The issue has been occurring on and
off since July 2020 and the attending veterinarian has not been contacted, and self treatments have not been successful.
This animal is in the same area with other regulated animals and where the handling exhibitions are held with the public.


The lack of timely veterinary care can cause an animal to be in unnecessary pain or discomfort.

The two tigers Tony (approx. 17 months old) approx. 500+lbs and Lilly (approx. 2yrs old) approx. 350+ lbs are obese
according to body condition scoring. The spine, hips and shoulders are not visible and they have no waist line due to a
large layer of fat. The belly of both tigers hang very low past the front elbows. During the inspection it was observed that
both tigers were panting continually when they would take a few steps and then lay down. The temperature was in the mid
60's. The owner advised he would 'rather have the animals too heavy than too thin because people complain'. The owner
did not feel the weight gain was a problem.

It is important to adjust the diet seasonally and with activity levels of tigers in order to prevent obesity. Overweight issues
could potentially cause physical problems with the heart, kidney and skeletal parts of the body including possible mobility
issues.
The diet and weight management of the tigers should be discussed and monitored by a veterinarian.

The licensee must contact a veterinarian to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases
and injuries. The veterinarian should be consulted about diet and diet changes for seasonal care and weight
management.

The ears of the short tailed opossum appeared to be better after a visit from a veterinary technician before the exit
interview on 3-16-21.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The 2020 acquisition and disposition records for the facility were not available during the time of the inspection. The
licensee advised they are at the tax office. There was a partial inventory available, however it was missing the 'acquired
from' addresses and the addition of four new domestic cats brought to the property.

The lack of updated and proper records can prevent proper management and traceability of the regulated animals coming
and going at the facility.

All records must be made available to the inspector at the time of inspection for proper tracking of the animals arriving or
leaving the facility, including all of the births and deaths. A broker is required to have all of their buying, selling and
donating activities documented in order to assist with traceability or disease monitoring and management.
2.131(a) Repeat

Handling of animals.
The owner of the facility is allowing volunteers to engage in behavior that puts their personal safety at risk, due to their
lack of experience and knowledge of tigers. The volunteers have posted photos of themselves being in the primary
enclosure where two sexually intact male and female tigers reside together. The tigers range in size from 350+lbs for the
female Lilly and 500+lbs for the male Tony.

The obesity of the two tigers due to the diet regimen they are currently on, has allowed these animals to become very
obese which can cause serious health issues and increases the likelihood of long term health issues. The facility
described the tigers weight as being 'mighty' and did not agree that the tigers were that over weight by more than a few
pound, and that they would just lose it in the summer. This situation and their response highlight the lack of knowledge

and experience in the raising and maintaining of tigers in a healthy weight range.

The risky behaviors include allowing the tigers to stand on their back feet putting their paws onto the volunteers' shoulders
while they feed them a bottle. One photo shows a woman with a tiger standing in front of her with its paws on her
shoulders as she stands against a wooden post, and the tiger is taller than her. This same volunteer is also shown
feeding a tiger a boiled egg out of her mouth, encouraging/allowing the tiger to take the egg from her using its mouth.

There is a male volunteer who allows himself to be sandwiched between both the male and female tigers at the same
time while he takes a photo. There are photos of this same man allowing a tiger to stand behind him and lick/mouth the
top of his head.

While the owner chooses to routinely partake in these risky behaviors after continuous warning of the safety risks by the
USDA, he advised inspectors one year prior that he would not allow his volunteers to do what he does. The owner stated
that he now feels that he has adequate knowledge/experience to train the few volunteers he allows to do these activities
because he raised the tigers from cubs and the older tiger is now 2 yrs old. The owner stated his training consists of him
allowing the volunteers into the primary enclosure and watching his interactions with the tigers and talking to the
volunteers. He stated it is a 'do as I say, not as I do kind of thing'.

The owner of the tigers has not received any recognized training with tigers since their arrival as cubs. He has two years
of raising them, as he stated 'learning as he goes'. The manager has cub experience only and minimal experience with
adult tigers. Neither owner nor manager demonstrate adequate experience or knowledge to maintain adult tigers.


The response of the owner advising it is ok to allow and encourage some volunteers to partake in the same risky handling
he practices, shows the lack of experience and knowledge of this dangerous animal by all those involved.

All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the species
they maintain.
2.131(c)(1) Repeat

Handling of animals.
During the inspection a tour was being conducted by a facility volunteer with a group of three adults and three children.
The group was brought up to the cougar enclosure with a male cougar (Mercury), approximately 4 months old that was
sitting on a shelf along the chicken wire fencing at the side of the enclosure. The young girl (approx.7-9yrs old) put her
fingers through the chicken wire to pet the cougar, while the keeper stood approximately 4ft away watching her. The
cougar was biting at the wire and mouthing anything put through the fence. When the keeper observed the inspectors
watching the child, he advised the group they were being 'spied on' and the one adult pushed the girls hand away from
the cage. The girl promptly put her fingers through the wire again to touch the animal before they moved on.

At this time, the situation was pointed out to the licensee who advised he did not think it was a problem since the keeper
was near by and the group was probably going in to pet the cougar later anyway. He felt there was no difference between
the little girl sticking her fingers into the enclosure to attempt to pet the cougar than if she was going inside the enclosure
to pet the cougar. It was explained that a young carnivore might view fingers coming through the wire in its enclosure
quite differently than when a trained, knowledgeable person had direct control of it. And, if there are no barriers to prevent
the public from coming into contact with the regulated animals, then the guides should not be allowing contact with
dangerous animals that they have no direct control over. If the cougar decided to bite the fingers, there is nothing the

guide could have done to stop it.

This is an example of the lack of experience and knowledge of the facility owner and volunteers when allowing the public
to interact with dangerous animals. The requirement for the keepers to have direct control over the handling of dangerous
animals during public contact has been discussed multiple times with the licensee and volunteers by several inspectors.

During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals
and the public. If there is direct contact with dangerous animals the keepers must have direct control and adequate
knowledge and experience with those animals.

Outdoor housing facilities.
There are 12 domestic cats being held in one enclosure that has only four small 'nest box' type shelters approximately 2' x
2' in size. There is one end of the enclosure that has some metal on top to help protect from rain/sun, however there are
not enough shelters to allow all of the cats to get into to protect them from inclement weather. Four new domestic cats
were recently obtained that had signs of upper respiratory infections (per the licensee) when they were brought to the
facility. A veterinarian had seen the cats after arrival. The new cats were placed in the outside enclosure after the licensee
felt they were better. During the inspection, one cat was still exhibiting upper respiratory signs (dark mucus discharge
from both eyes). Weather in the past two weeks in the area has been rainy and cold ranging from 28.5 F to 65.8 F from
3/1/21 to 3/10/21, the low temp was in the 20s to 30s F for 9 of the 10 days via info from the internet
(https:/visualcrossing.com/weather-history/west%union%2C%20illinois/us/2021-03-01/2021-03-10).


Adequate shelter from inclement weather is necessary to protect animals that are already sick. Not having adequate
shelter could further compromise the health of sick animals.

The lack of enough shelter for the cats could be a source of stress from environmental elements that could cause or
promote illness in the animal population.

Outdoor facilities for cats must include enough shelter structures that are accessible to each animal that are large enough
to allow each animal in the shelter structure at the same time to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about
freely.

The licensee provided additional shelter boxes to house the remaining cats by the time of the exit interview on 3-16-21.
3.10(b) Direct

Watering
The main water bucket that was being used for the cats had sides that were too high (approx. 12 inches high with a water
level of approx. 4 inches inside). The level of the water was too low for them to utilize, since a domestic cat will not tend
to drop down over 4 inches into a container, placing their feet into the water to be able to drink. The other bowls in the
enclosure used for food were empty and there was no water available in any of those bowls. When the licensee was
asked to put water in a bowl and put it in the enclosure, over 6 cats surrounded the water bowl, with three immediately
drinking from it while others waited their turn. One of the cats (the one still exhibiting upper respirator signs) drank for 5
minutes while another drank for 4 minutes and a 3rd cat for almost another 4 minutes.

Due to the reactions of multiple cats to the fresh water being brought in during the inspection, it is obvious that fresh,

potable water is not being offered often enough, or in suitable containers for them to drink as often as necessary to
ensure their health and well-being.

The lack of potable and accessible water can be a source of stress and possible illness and kidney issues if not provided
as often as needed to the regulated animals.

If potable water is not continuously available to the cats, it must be offered to the cats as often as necessary to ensure
their health and well-being.

Water was given at the inspectors request during the inspection and needs to be provided often enough from this day
forward.

Housing facilities, general.
There are surfaces in multiple non-human primate primary enclosures that are made of unsealed wood materials. There is
a buildup of old food, oils or dirt and debris that is soaked into the well used areas of some of the wood surfaces. It is
impossible to clean/sanitize unsealed wood surfaces. The walls and nest boxes in the squirrel monkey and marmoset
enclosure, the wall in the ruffed lemur and the shelves and perches in the Japanese snow macaque area have not been
sealed and are made of raw wood. The painted/sealed wooden shelves in the enclosure of two ring-tailed lemurs has
been chewed exposing raw wood areas that cannot be sanitized. The ropes that have been attached inside some of the
enclosures are dark black and brown with grime and need to be cleaned or replaced. The licensee advised the ropes had
been sitting in the dirt in the yard for a month and he put them in the enclosures as they were. The ropes have not been
cleaned to remove the dirt and grime since they were put up.


Unsealed wood or surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be cleaned and sanitized properly. If they cannot
be cleaned and sanitized appropriately, they must be replaced. Soiled surfaces can be a source of bacteria and cause
possible health related issues if not cleaned or replaced regularly.

The surfaces of housing facilities - including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses, dens, and other furniture-type
fixtures or objects within the facility - must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.

The licensee washed the dirty ropes for the squirrel monkey and marmoset and painted the wood surfaces in the
marmoset enclosure by the time of the exit interview on 3-16-21.
3.78(e) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.
The Japanese macaque (snow monkey) (Dexter) was used for public handling over the summer/fall months of 2020
where the public was allowed full contact with the animal while not in direct control of a trained keeper. The macaque was
allowed to move around the room, climbing onto peoples' laps, sitting on top of children's shoulders and get close to
young children and adults in a face to face manner while a leash hung to the floor. There is no direct control of the
monkey by a trained keeper during this exhibition.

The lack of direct control over a non-human primate during public exhibitions can be a potential for injury to the animal or

public if the animal panics or gets overly excited while climbing onto peoples' laps, shoulders and within face to face
contact of members of the public. There is no way to get control of the animal in a timely manner if the leash is hanging
down onto the floor being pulled along by the animal without a trained keeper holding onto it.

When a nonhuman primate is allowed contact with the general public, it must be under the direct control and supervision
of an experienced handler or trainer at all times when the public is present. Trained nonhuman primates may be allowed
physical contact with the public, but only if they are under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or
trainer at all times during the contact.

The licensee advised they are no longer conducting public handling interactions with the macaque.
3.81 Repeat

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The environmental enrichment and enhancement plans for the primates have been written up by the facility, however they
have not yet been directed by the attending veterinarian. This is especially important for the primates that are being
housed separately with no physical contact with other primates (marmoset and squirrel monkey) to assure that the
animals are being housed in a manner that is physically adequate and meets behavioral needs of the animals.

A veterinarian directed, documented and adhered to enrichment/enhancement plan for the non-human primates is
essential for their health and well being.

The licensee must provide a plan that is directed by the attending veterinarian that addresses all sections of this
regulation, and it must be followed by the facility.

3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
There is a Geoffroy's cat and prehensile tailed porcupine that are housed in primary enclosures that do not provide any
sort of hide or shelter box/log for the animal to seek shelter in. The porcupine's primary enclosure is a corn crib, and the
primary enclosure for the Geoffroy's cat is open on two sides, so there is no protection from the wind, rain, snow or other
climatic elements that could stress the animals.

There is a fenced area holding 5 goats (2 currently at a neighbors with their kids) and 1 pig with four babies and 2 rheas.
There is only one wooden shelter box approximately 4'x8' by 2' in height to provide shelter to all of the animals in
inclement weather or to provide shade. While the fenced enclosure has trees around the area, in the winter when the
leaves are gone there is not another area of shade available under a shelter for all of the animals to fit comfortably.

There are two full grown tigers over 350-500 lbs according to the licensee, that have one shelter box that is too small for
them to fit into comfortably without having to crawl or contort in order to get inside. This concern was mentioned one year
ago as the tigers were showing signs of getting too big for that shelter box. The shelter box is shorter than they are tall
and too small to allow for normal postural movements and does not allow for them to sit, stand and laydown comfortably.
While their enclosure does have shade cloth on both ends on the top of the enclosure and metal sheeting on
approximately 3-4ft wide on the south side(rd side) of the enclosure and a 12'x12' square on part of the roof area on the
end of the second part of the enclosure, the current shelter box located in the middle of the first enclosure area is not
large enough to appropriately protect the tigers from inclement weather conditions.

The lack of proper shelter to provide a windbreak, protection from the elements (including temperatures) can be a source

of possible health or behavioral issues. The shelters must be large enough for the number of animals to all be able to fit
into comfortably and be protected from the elements.

Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

To be corrected by: March 30, 2021 for the tiger shelter box

The licensee provided shelter for the Geoffroy's, prehensile tailed porcupine and an additional shelter box in goat/pig yard
the following day on 3-11-21 and started working on making the tiger shelter larger.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The eight foot perimeter fence surrounding the facility is still under construction. The South and East sides of the facility
are still completely open with no fence structure to prevent animals from escaping the property. The North and NW part of
the property has a six foot perimeter fence, with the SW part of the property having an eight foot wooden fence behind the
tiger, vervet and porcupine enclosures.

An eight foot perimeter fence is required for the two cougar and two tigers that are in outdoor primary enclosures on the
facility property due to being considered dangerous animals.

There is no six foot perimeter fence completely surrounding the non-dangerous animals as required. This requirement is
for animals such as the three badgers (bottom of the perimeter fence is not secured and open for animals to get under),

the two coati, Geoffroy's cat, bobcat and non-human primates. While a six foot perimeter fence and partial eight foot
perimeter fence surround over half the facility, the remaining South and East sides are open which can allow any of these
animals to escape if they get out of their primary enclosures, and allow other animals or people to gain entry into the
facility and make direct contact with the enclosures.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
