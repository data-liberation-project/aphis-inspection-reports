2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care did not include written guidance for what, when, amount, or how a treatment or
prevention was to be given to the adult dogs and puppies. What was written was not accurate to what the licensee
was doing. The licensee stated the attending veterinarian had given new instructions, but the instructions were not
in written form.
The lack of written guidance for appropriate methods to maintain the health of regulated animals can cause
preventable injury or disease, and/or the wrong treatment and care for the animal when something does occur. The
licensee must make formal arrangements with an appropriate and knowledgeable veterinarian which includes a
written program of veterinary care for all regulated animals at the facility to include the use of appropriate methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend, and
holiday care. Details in the written plan of veterinary care should include what treatment, when, how much and by
what route/method it is to be administered.
