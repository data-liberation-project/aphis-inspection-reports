2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
One male tabby tiger cub born 7/17/2015 (19 days old) is located in a public viewing area next to older cubs that are
used for public contact. The tiger cub is housed in a play pen type enclosure with no secondary heating or cooling
method for climate control. The enclosure is located off to the side behind the public barriers, but it is still located in
front of the enclosures holding the tigers used for public contact. The public does not walk directly by the tiger cub in
the playpen, however there is a walkway approximately ten feet away from the tiger cub that the public uses to gain
access to the area of public contact for the older cubs. The licensee has contact with the general viewing public and
states he is the primary caretaker for all of the cubs. The licensee stated that there is no public contact with the
young cub. The license also stated the cub is typically located on the RV and not normally out in the public viewing
area.

AnimaIs this young in the absence of their parents are not able to adequately thermoregulate and exposure to
temperatures which may be comfortable for adults may still be detrimental to the health of young cubs. Exposure to
an excessive number of people and other animals at this young age poses a disease risk to the cub. Even indirect
exposure via the licensee who has contact with the members of the public and other animals can pose a similar risk
to the cub of this age. The practices described above do not constitute handling the cub as carefully as possible and
unnecessarily risks harm and discomfort. Young animals may appear to cope with temperature extremes, however
when they are this young they are not able to thermoregulate and exposure to certain temperatures can be
detrimental to the health of the animal. The licensee must ensure that tiger cubs of this age are handled as carefully
as possible in a temperature controlled environment that minimizes exposure to potential pathogens.
The licensee moved the animal to a climate controlled RV prior to the exit briefing.
To be corrected from this day forward.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted at the Mississippi Valley Fair in Davenport, IA with the licensee andHeather Cole, VMO.
