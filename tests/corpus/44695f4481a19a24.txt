Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Accurate and timely communication with a veterinarian does not appear to have occurred for a male serval names Dakari.
According to the attending veterinarian, this cat was treated by the facility for a week prior to seeking medical care with
the veterinarian. The animal ultimately died. The AV felt the animal should have received veterinary care sooner than it
did.
The facility needs to communicate with the attending veterinarians about animal health concerns prior to the animals
dying or requiring euthanasia.

psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The facility has previously developed an environment enhancement
program but it was not available at the time of inspection and the facility’s current AV has not approved it. The plan must
be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or
reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian. A plan needs to be created and approved by the
