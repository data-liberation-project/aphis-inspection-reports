ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30a on
01-Nov-18.
The inspector arrived at the facility, knocked on the residence door, honked the government vehicle horn, and called
and left a message at the number on file. A short while later, the inspector received a return call from a licensee.
The licensee stated that they both were not available to return home for an inspection.
