Feeding.
The refrigerator and freezer in the food-prep area have food items that are being stored uncovered. There is also spilled
blood frozen on the bottom of the freezer. Blood is a rich medium for bacterial growth. Items stored uncovered are prone
to freezer burn and contamination, diminishing the wholesomeness of the food.
Keeping food items covered in sealed containers, and wiping up spills promptly helps ensure a wholesome,
uncontaminated food supply for the animals.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by August 8, 2022, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
