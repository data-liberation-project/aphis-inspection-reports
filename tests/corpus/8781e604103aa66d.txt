2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was a Yorkshire Terrier (# 38) that had wet fur around it's mouth. On observation of the dog's mouth, there
was a heavy build-up of yellowish brown material on the majority of the teeth. There was a whitish gray creamy
material observed at the gum line of the cheek teeth. The abnormal build-up of material on the dogs' teeth can
cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This dog's dental condition could be painful, may decrease
the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health. The licensee must have this dog examined
by a licensed veterinarian no later than June 27, 2015 in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and
appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must develop and follow an effective dental
care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the facility.
3.6(c)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Minimun floor space.
***In the whelping portion of the building, the licensee had adult dogs housed individually with their puppies. The
dogs in 3 of the enclosures and the enclosures themselves were measured to determine if the animals had
adequate floor space. Two of the enclosures that were measured did not have adequate floor space to meet the
minimum floor space for these dogs.
The first enclosure measured was 30" x 31". This enclosure provided 6.46 square feet of floor space. The Beagle (#
25) in the enclosure was measured at 23" in length, she had 7 puppies and required 7.87 square feet of floor space
to meet the primary enclosure minimum floor space requirements.
The second enclosure measured was 30" x 31". This enclosure provided 6.46 square feet of floor space. The
Beagle (# 97) in the enclosure was measured at 23" in length, she had 6 puppies and required 7.58 square feet of
floor space to meet the primary enclosure minimum floor space requirements.
Lack of minimum floor space can affect the freedom of movement affecting the health and well-being of the animals.
The licensee must provide at least the minimum amount of floor space for all dogs at all times.
