2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Buddy" a male long hair gray with black points cat had large mattes of bound hair on the rear portion of his hind
legs and at the base of his tail. He did not allow the inspector to touch him and therefore it is unknown how tightly
bound the hair is. The licensee stated she was lucky if she could pet him, that combing/brushing him did not
happen, because of his dislike of being handled, and that he will have to be taken to the veterinarian to have the
mattes removed. Matted hair can pull at the skin, cause infection, and can get contaminated with feces, all which
can cause discomfort and or pain. The licensee must us appropriate and adequate veterinary care to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injury.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In all of the enclosures affecting all of the cats there was a buildup of brown grime on the floors of the enclosures,
and hair, litter, dust and cob webs on most of the other surfaces within the indoor facility. The licensee stated the
enclosures are sanitized about once a month. There was an obvious smell of ammonia consistent with urine inside
the building. The lack of cleaning within the facility can cause disease to be harbored, attract rodents and pest, and
cause odors that could affect the respiratory systems of the animals. The licensee must clean and sanitize the
surfaces in accordance to 3.11(b) at least every two weeks or more often as necessary for the surfaces in contact
with the animals and all other surfaces of the housing facility when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices.
