2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary (PVC) care lacks guidance for the method of euthanasia. There is no specific
guidance in the PVC for the method of euthanasia to be used by the facility, including its use, equipment, and
personnel trained and authorized to perform the euthanasia for the various species. The PVC states that the
method of euthanasia is carbon dioxide, but there are no details on its use at the facility by personnel. Specific
guidance and training in the procedure for euthanasia by the attending veterinarian is required to ensure the
animals are humanely euthanized according to the latest AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2013
edition).
Additional specific guidance is required for the euthanasia section on the PVC. Failure to have specific, accurate
guidance does not ensure that the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also
does not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct by
developing and implementing a complete program of veterinary care that describes all methods of euthanasia used
by facility personnel for animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by July 14, 2016.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The four guinea pigs identified on the May 25, 2016 inspection report, were examined by the attending veterinarian
(AV) on May 26, 2016. The AV prescribed topical treatment for the affect skin areas every five days. The licensee
has no records identifying which animals are affected, a description of the affected areas of the skin, when
treatments were administered, or the response to the treatment.

There are over 2000 guinea pigs at this facility. The four animals plus at least six additional guinea pigs have
evidence of topical treatment being applied to their skin. Failure to have adequate documentation identifying which
animals are affected would make it difficult to ensure that all the affected guinea pigs were located to follow up with
their care. Without records describing the affected skin, it is difficult to determine if the animal is getting better or
worse. Failure to list dates of treatments makes it difficult to know when to repeat the treatment in five days,especially when multiple animals are being treated in different enclosures and buildings. Documenting response to
treatment is necessary to determine if treatment may be stopped or if the AV needs to provide further
guidance/recommendations. Correct by keeping and maintaining records on animals receiving veterinary care that
identify the animal, describe the problem, document the administration of treatment, and the response to the
treatment.
3.29(d)
FEEDING.
Multiple enclosures in both buildings had feces in the self-feeders especially in the enclosures where feces had
accumulated around the feeder and the automatic water valves (See section 3.31(a)(1)). A few of the self-feeders
had caked food in the corners of the trough. The self-feeders in wooden enclosures in both buildings are screwed
into the wall of the enclosure between the two automatic water valves. These feeders are not being removed and
sanitized at least once every two weeks. Debris and feces is accumulating on the rims and lower portions of the
feeders. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal and
viral diseases. Food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as often as necessary and at least once every 2
weeks. Correct by keeping the self-feeders clean and sanitizing the self-feeder at least once every 2 weeks.
Correct by June 28, 2016.
3.30
WATERING.
There were accumulations of dirt and debris by the automatic water valves, metal rings over the holes for the water
valves, and wood by the water valves. The water pipes and drainage pipes have accumulations of debris, grime,
dust, and cobwebs. These accumulations on the water valves, metal rings and wood by the water valves exposes
the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Inadequate cleaning and sanitation of the
automatic water valves and the surrounding areas can result in contamination of the guinea pig colony. Correct by
keeping the water valves, water lines and surrounding areas clean to ensure the health and well-being of the guinea
pigs. Correct by June 21, 2016.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The green tub enclosures in building 1 appeared to have been cleaned and sanitized, but there is still a heavy
buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the wooden sides and floor of the enclosures in building 1. There
were wooden enclosures (about 5 %) in both buildings that had fecal material consolidated in a moist fecal pad on
the floor area by the self-feeder and the two automatic water valves. Other wooden enclosures (about 5 %) had
excessive feces accumulating in the same area as the self-feeder and the two automatic water valves. These
enclosures had feces in the trough of the self-feeders (See section 3.29(d)). Correct by ensuring that all primary
enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and debris. Additionally,ensure that the primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks.
Note: Guinea pigs had adequate space on this inspection. An exit interview was conducted with the owner, Robert
Markmann, ACI, and Mary Geib, VMO.
