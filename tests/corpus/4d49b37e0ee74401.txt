FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Food storage.
(1) There was an opened bag of rabbit feed sitting on the floor of housing room. Storing opened bags of food in
this manner does not adequately protect the food from contamination or the deterioration of nutrients.
Per this Section of the Regulations, supplies of food should be stored using a method that will adequately protect
the food from contamination or nutrient deterioration such as placing the food in a container with a lid.
Correct by 4/25/15.

SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
The following housekeeping items were identified during the inspection.(1) There was an excessive amount of dust, hair, and particulate debris located on the top of the caging rack that
held primary enclosures containing rabbits. In addition, there was an empty food dish, tube of medication, cleansing
wipes, and a small cleaning brush located on the top of the caging rack.
(2) The epoxy paint on the wall around the wall-mounted faucet and hose unit right above the janitor sink in the
procedure room had several areas where the paint had lifted up and come away from the underlying wall board.
There were some areas of the wall that had large flakes of paint and other areas where the paint had come off
exposing the underlying wall board. In addition some of the areas of the wall above the janitor sink were no longer
substantially impervious to moisture because the underlying wall board was exposed.
Per this Section of the Regulations, premises shall be kept clean and in good repair to protect the health of the
animals and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices as set forth in this subpart.
The facility needs to address the excessive dust and clutter on the top of the caging rack and address the condition
of the wall above the janitor sink in order to keep the premises clean and maintained in good repair.
Correct item (1) by 4/20/15; and item (2) by 7/20/15.
