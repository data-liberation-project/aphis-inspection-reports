2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male blue Boston Terrier was observed limping on its left hind leg. The dog was being housed with another tan colored
Boston terrier. The dog was not bearing any weight on the leg, and was observed holding it up in the air. The licensee
had not previously identified this issue. Animals with any health issues need to be identified and communicated to the
attending veterinarian in a timely manner. The license initiated corrective actions by contacting the attending veterinarian
to arrange veterinary care for this animal.

Time and method of identification.
The facility has no official identification for the dogs on hand, both adults and weaned puppies. All dogs must be identified
at the facility. The licensee must develop and maintain a system of identification and maintain records containing the
required information. Failure to properly identify all dogs in the facility also does not allow for animal tracking, which is
especially important in the event of a disease outbreak.

Housing facilities, general.
1. A wooden stockade fence had fallen down partially and was observed leaning on the outdoor chain-link fencing of the
outdoor dog enclosures. This condition could compromise the enclosures and potentially cause injury to the dogs. All
structures must be kept in good repair and be structurally sound.

2. Two enclosures were observed with jagged edges around the dog doors leading to the outdoor portion of the
enclosure. Jagged edges cannot be effectively sanitized, may contribute to injury of the animals. Facilities must be kept in
good repair.

causing agents and can cause health issues. Cleaning primary enclosures needs to occur daily to prevent buildup of
waste.
