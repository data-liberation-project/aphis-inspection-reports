INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The unaffiliated member of the IACUC did not attend the last three IACUC meetings held on 5/18/2015, 11/19/2015
and 5/25/2016. The irregular attendance of this required member of the committee does not demonstrate
representation of general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals as intended under the
Animal Welfare Act. The unaffiliated member must participate in IACUC activities to signify complete committee
membership and function.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Reports of the IACUC semiannual evaluations of the facility inspections and program review have not been
submitted to the Institutional Official for the last three inspections and reviews. No reports were submitted for the
5/18/15, 11/19/15 and 5/25/16 inspections and reviews. The reports shall be updated every six months upon
completion of the required semiannual evaluations. Updated reports and submission to the IO is required to ensure
appropriate communication is maintained between the IACUC and IO on issues of facility adherence and
compliance with AWA regulations and standards.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Approved protocol 15-02 using rabbits describes the use of a Ketamine/Xylazine anesthetic cocktail to be
administered IM or IV. Discussion with personnel conducting this procedure indicated the drug combination is
actually given IP. Deviations from protocols related to minimizing pain and distress can be considered significant
changes and shall be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to implementation. Consideration of topics for
review might include appropriateness of route of drug administration according to established species guidelines. Correct by: Immediate

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Approved protocol 15-01 does not contain a complete description of the euthanasia method to be used. Although
the protocol states the dosage of Ketamine/Xylazine combination to be given the route of administration of the drugs
is not documented. The IACUC must ensure that all protocols contain the information required under the AWA
including an appropriate method of euthanasia. Prior to approval the IACUC must confirm that proposed euthanasia
activities are conducted using established AVMA guidelines and humane administration.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The most current written program of veterinary care dated June 2015 is incomplete. The information provided under
the euthanasia section does not indicate which drug(s), dose or route of administration will be used for the animals
at this facility. Since the PVC states that only the registrant will be performing euthanasias it is imperative that a
complete description of the procedure and methods is clearly delineated. Assurance must be provided that
euthanasia is conducted in accordance with AVMA guidelines.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
*Guinea pigs used under protocol 15 -01 are euthanized using a Ketamine/Xylazine injectable drug combination and
is stated to be administered at three times the standard anesthetic dose. According to AVMA 2013 euthanasia
guidelines the use of a dissociative anesthetic in combination with an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist should be
administered at five times the anesthetic dose standard when used in laboratory animals for euthanasia.
*During discussion with personnel responsible for the above described euthanasia procedure the criteria used to
confirm death in the guinea pigs after euthanasia and prior to body disposal could not be provided to this inspector.
The individual was asked twice how confirmation of death was determined and no answer was given. AVMA
guidelines and industry standard for humane euthanasia mandate that death must always be confirmed using
established criteria.
Guidance to principal investigators and personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding euthanasiamust be provided to establish the provision for adequate veterinary care required to be maintained by research
facilities. The combination of inadequate euthanasia dosages and lack of confirmation of death prior to body
disposal can have painful and distressful consequences for the animals involved. The facility should review
euthanasia training, methods and techniques to ensure humane handling of animals and adequate veterinary care
regarding euthanasia that at least parallels accepted veterinary standards.
