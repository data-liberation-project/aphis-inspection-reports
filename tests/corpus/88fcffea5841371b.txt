2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
On September 30th, 2022 an unauthorized individual was able to gain entrance to the white rhino enclosure while the
enclosure was occupied. Once observed, the individual was immediately removed, and neither the animal nor the
individual were harmed.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals
and the public.
Corrected prior to inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
