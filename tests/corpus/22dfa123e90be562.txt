2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The following animals are in need of veterinary care:
1) The older female New Guinea singing dog has a circular area about a half inch in diameter of hair loss above
both front carpal joints (distal radius/foreleg). These areas of hair loss are in the same areas that domestic dogs
may have lick granulomas. There is no documentation of this condition in the records for the animal and the
attending veterinarian was not consulted. Hair loss may have many causes such as parasites, infectious,
nutritional, may be a sign of a more serious health concern and/or be self-inflicted (licking). The New Guinea
singing dog must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care.

2) The female white and black pot-bellied pig has hair loss and flaky skin on the top of the head between the ears,
on the back behind the shoulders to the hips, and an area on the right side over the rib cage. There is no
documentation of this condition in the records for the animal and the attending veterinarian was not consulted. Hair
loss may have many causes such as parasites, infectious, nutritional, may be a sign of a more serious health
concern and/or be self-inflicted (rubbing). The pot-bellied pig must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to
provide appropriate veterinary care.

3) The male Dromedary camel has a circular wound/sore about a quarter inch in diameter on his left front leg at the
top lateral edge of the callus on his carpal joint (at the 1 o’clock position). The tissue is red and there appears to be
dried blood in the area. There is no documentation of this condition in the records for the animal and the attending
veterinarian was not consulted. Wounds may become infected. The camel must be evaluated by the attending
veterinarian to provide appropriate care.

Correct by having the above animals evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The licensee must document and
maintain records of the examination, treatment and outcome for future inspections by APHIS officials. The
attending veterinarian was previously scheduled to come to the facility today and evaluated and treated the above
animals while at the facility. Corrected during the inspection. This inspection was conducted with a facility animal caretaker and the facility vice president. The exit interview
were conducted with the facility vice president.
