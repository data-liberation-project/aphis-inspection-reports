3.2(d)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* The interior four walls of the indoor whelp building needs to be finished housing eight adult and twenty three
puppies. The wood frame boards and insulation were exposed. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can
absorb liquids. This could create disease hazards and unsanitary living conditions which can affect the health and
well-being of the dogs. Indoor facilities must have floors, walls, and ceilings that are impervious to moisture.
Surfaces must be impervious to moisture so that they cannot absorb urine or water, can be readily cleaned and
sanitized. The licensee must ensure that the floors and walls of indoor housing facilities and any other surfaces in
contact with the animals, must be impervious to moisture. Correct by 6/14/19.
* Facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 5/14/19 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent by electronic email.
