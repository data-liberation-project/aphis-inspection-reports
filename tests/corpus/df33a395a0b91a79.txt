A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:45 pm on
15-Apr-19. Upon arrival, the inspector knocked on the facility door and an individual answered. The individual
indicated the licensee was not there and he wasn't sure when she would return. The inspector then called the
licensee's phone and left a message. The licensee later texted the inspector indicating she was away and
unavailable to conduct an inspection.
A responsible adult shall be available to accompany inspection during business hours.
