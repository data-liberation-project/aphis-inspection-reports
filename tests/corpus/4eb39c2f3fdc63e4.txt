2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care dated 7-24-15 was reviewed today. It is incomplete lacking information in
many areas. There is no information regarding dosages and frequency of administration of any drugs for the control
of internal, blood and external parasites and vaccines. There is simply a statement that the veterinarian does not
administer these drugs. Conversations with staff and the owner show that the animals are currently being
dewormed orally and treated with fly spray. The section in the PC regarding capture methods states that rompum
and ace are to be used but does not state who will be administering these drugs and if the facility staff is to do so
what dosages they should use for the different species. There is nothing written regarding any TB testing of
susceptible species to include some of the hoofstock and the non-human primates.
The facility and the attending veterinarian need to jointly decide on all preventative veterinary procedures, drugs and
vaccines to be administered to the animals even if they are going to be administered by the facility staff. The
instructions for these procedures, drugs and vaccines should be detailed in written form and then the facility shall
ensure that they are followed. The facility shall document and maintain a written program of veterinary care
approved by the attending veterinarian to ensure the appropriate health care for the animals at the facility.

*The inspector was told that the veterinarian did come out to evaluate the two deer but no written documentation
was available for review and the vet clinic was closed today. The young female deer's wound has healed. The older
female deer is still thin with a prominent backbone. The hips appear slightly less prominent today. She is not
currently on any treatment.
*The female snow macaque "Betsy" is currently cycling but also appears to have diarrhea. The hair on the stump of
her tail is wet and soiled. There appears to be some dark black brown fecal material adhered around the anal area.
The shavings on the inside of her cage appear wet with dark brown black material. Staff reports that she started
having diarrhea on Monday possibly relating to fresh produce she was fed. The facility self treated with someantibiotic and dewormer. No documentation was kept as to what was administered and the attending veterinarian
was not consulted. The caretaker reports that she is doing better today (Wednesday). Her food was noted still
present in her food receptacle; the male snow macaques food receptacle was empty. Staff reported that she was
still eating.
All problems of health and well-being need to be addressed by the attending veterinarian to ensure a proper
diagnosis and treatment plan. All treatment plans should be documented in writing.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The female snow macaque "Betsy" was noted to have diarrhea on Monday and was treated by facility staff without
contacting the attending veterinarian. The written program of veterinary care does not include any treatment plan for
cases of diarrhea in non-human primates. The facility is conducting daily observation of the animals but is not
notifying the attending veterinarian in a timely manner to ensure appropriate veterinary care.
Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct by 9/18/15.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The attending veterinarian has signed of on a written environment enhancement program for non-human primates
but it is incomplete and lacks required information. The written plan does not include the snow macaques at all. The
written plan does not address the singly housed (11 months of the year) spider monkey. The plan addresses the
physical environmental enrichment of the monkeys' enclosure but does not address their social and psychological
needs. The facility shall develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate
to promote the psychological well-being of the non-human primates that has been approved by the attending
veterinarian.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following enclosures are not structurally sound and are in need of maintenance:
*The fencing of the bison enclosure still needs some repair. The panels adjacent to the barn structure have beenrepaired. The section that consists of wooden boards that are leaning still needs repair. The fence post is rotted.
*The two metal side by side doors at the front of the porcupine enclosure are not structurally sound. The wire points
have been fixed but the bottom corners of both doors where two metal pipes come together that have rusted out
with loss of structurally integrity have not yet been replaced.
Loss of structural integrity of fencing materials can lead to enclosures that are not sound and to injury to the
animals. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
Inspection conducted with caretaker. Exit conducted with owner.
