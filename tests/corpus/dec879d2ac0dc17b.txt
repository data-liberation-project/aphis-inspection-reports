2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
1) The attending veterinarian came to the facility on Friday, November 14, 2014 to examine the guinea pigs with
hair loss and sores/scabs cited on the November 12, 2014 inspection report. Treatment for the entire guinea pig
colony was prescribed for the hair loss. The licensee treated the guinea pigs in rows 1 and 4 on Saturday,
November 15, 2014, but not rows 2 and 3. An adult white guinea pig with hair loss and a large scab on the top of its
back with thinning hair on its sides and an adult tricolor guinea pig with hair loss on its sides in row 3 that were cited
on the previous inspection report had not received treatment yet. There were an additional 364 guinea pigs in rows
2 and 3 that had not yet been treated by the licensee.
2) The attending veterinarian approved the medication the licensee was using for the treatment of presumed
ringworm. The attending veterinarian had directed the licensee to apply the treatment to the presumed ringworm
lesions once a day. There was no documentation or markings on enclosures of which guinea pigs had been
identified with lesions or of any guinea pigs receiving the ringworm treatment. The licensee informed the APHIS
officials that the guinea pigs in rows one and four received the ringworm medication on Saturday, November 15,
2014. During this inspection there were three guinea pigs in row 1, two guinea pigs in row 2, two guinea pigs on
row 3 and one guinea pig in row 4 with circular areas of crusts/scabs and hair loss. During this inspection the
licensee treated these animals for presumed ringworm as directed by his attending veterinarian and documented
the treatment on enclosure cards.
3) In row 3 in the third enclosure from the top of the third column of enclosures was a black and white guinea pig
with a white blaze down its nose with a distinct head tilt to the right. This animal had not previously been noticed by
the licensee and had not received any veterinary examination, diagnostic procedures or treatment as directed by
the attending veterinarian for this condition. A head tilt is a serious medical condition that may result from multiple
causes such ear infection and neurological disease. This condition may be contagious. This animal must be
examined and treated as directed by the attending veterinarian.

4) In row 3 in the sixth enclosure from the top of the sixth column of enclosures was a weanling tricolor guinea pig
with runny fecal material caked to its rear end. This weanling was hunched over by itself and was reluctant to
move. Later in the inspection the weanling was observed eating, but it still was not as active as the otherweanlings in the enclosure. This animal had not previously been noticed by the licensee and had not received any
veterinary examination, diagnostic procedures or treatment as directed by the attending veterinarian for this
condition. Diarrhea in small animals like weanlings can cause dehydration and death if left untreated and may
affect the health of the other guinea pigs in and next to its enclosure. The licensee separated this weanling during
this inspection, but the guinea pig has not received any additional care. This animal must be examined and treated
as directed by the attending veterinarian.
The licensee must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The two guinea pigs in row 3 (items #3 & #4)
must be examined and treated as directed by the attending veterinarian. Records of the examination, diagnosis and
treatment must be maintained for APHIS officials. The guinea pigs in rows 2 and 3 must receive the colony
treatment for hair loss and the guinea pigs identified with presumed ringworm lesions must receive the treatment as
prescribed by the attending veterinarian to prevent the spread of disease and limit the suffering of the animals.
Remains uncorrected.
2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection there were an adult guinea pig with a distinct head tilt to the right and an weanling guinea pig
with diarrhea described in Section 2.40(b)(2). The licensee had not noticed these two guinea pigs prior to this
inspection. The attending veterinarian came to the facility on Friday, November 14, 2014 for the guinea pigs with
the hair loss and sore/scabs, but has not been notified of the conditions of these two animals. Daily observations
are still not being adequately performed. A failure to conduct adequate observations with direct communication with
the attending veterinarian can result in a delay of care provided to the animals and prolong animal suffering. All
animals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on the problems of animal
health and well-being are conveyed.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Heating.The temperature fluctuated in the guinea pig building from a low of 48.5 degrees F. to a high of 61.9
degrees F. during the inspection. The lowest temperature reading was measured adjacent to the guinea pig
enclosures in the northwest corner of the building near the beginning of the inspection. At that time the windowswere partially opened and the wind speed reached greater than 1 mph at the nearest cages (row 4, column 1). The
windows were closed at that time, however, both wall mounted heaters still had to be turned up to get the
temperature 60 degrees or higher in some areas of the building. Several areas of the building still did not reach 60
degrees F. even with this modification. Between rows 2 and 3, the temperature only reached 58.5 degrees F. by
the end of the inspection. Although the bedding in most enclosures had been recently replaced, several that had
bedding added on Wednesday, November 12, 2014 (and higher numbers of animals), had large portions of the
bedding that were damp with urine and spilled water. Guinea pigs are very sensitive to both drafts and changes in
temperature. Animals may become ill if temperature is not closely monitored and kept between 60-85 degrees
Fahrenheit. The licensee must ensure that the temperature is maintained at acceptable levels throughout the entire
facility regardless of changing conditions outside. Continued monitoring of the temperature in the guinea pig
building is necessary with changing weather. Adjustments to the heaters, windows, fans, and vents must be made
to keep the ambient temperature from falling below 60 degrees F. or exceeding 85 degrees F. when guinea pigs are
present.
Correct from this day forward.
3.26(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation. At the start of the inspection, the windows were partly opened in the guinea pig room for ventilation.
Drafts were measured with the Kestrel 4000 that exceeded 3 miles per hour near the windows and exceeding 1 mile
per hour at the guinea pig enclosures nearest the windows. Guinea pigs in the nearest enclosures were observed
huddling initially and later (once windows were closed) were observed grooming and engaged in other normal
behavior. In the afternoon when the windows were closed to increase the temperature and stop the drafts, the
ammonia smell increased in the guinea pig building. The strongest ammonia odors were present in the middle of the
building between rows 2 and 3. Ammonia can irritate the eyes and respiratory tracts of the guinea pigs and cause
the animals to be more susceptible to eye and respiratory tract infections. Additionally, significant drafts may result
in the development of multiple health problems. Rows 2 and 3 were last cleaned on Wednesday, November 12,
2014 and multiple enclosures contained wet bedding. More frequent bedding changes and cleaning are necessary
when the windows are closed to prevent harmful ammonia levels to rise in the guinea pig building. The guinea pig
building must be ventilated so as to minimize drafts, odors and moisture condensation. Indoor housing facilities for
guinea pigs must be adequately ventilated to provide for the health and comfort of the animals.
Correct from this day forward.
3.30
WATERING.
There were accumulations of brown debris by some of the automatic water valves especially underneath the valve.These accumulations around the water valves expose the guinea pigs to potential disease infections with bacterial,
fungi and parasites. The licensee is treating some of the guinea pigs for ringworm and generalized hair loss and at
least one animal exhibited signs of diarrhea making sanitation of all primary enclosures and watering systems of
increased importance. Water receptacles such as automatic water delivery lines must be cleaned and sanitized
whenever dirty and at least once every two weeks. Inadequate cleaning of the automatic water valves can result in
contamination of the guinea pigs in the same enclosure and located in lower enclosures from those above.
Licensee must establish and maintain a program to keep the water valves sanitized when dirty, and must be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
Correct by November 21, 2014
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning and fresh bedding were provided to guinea pig enclosures in rows 2 and 3 on Wednesday, November 12,
2014. Cleaning, sanitation, and fresh bedding were provided to guinea pigs in rows 1 and 4 on Saturday, November
15, 2014. Cleaning of enclosures still needs improvement. Feces and debris were accumulating near and on the
enclosure wall partitions and door frames in some of the enclosures. Dirt, debris, feces, and old bedding were
present on the upper wooden shelves in enclosures in row 3 and 4. Ammonia odors and wet bedding were present
in some of the enclosures in rows 2 and 3, especially enclosures housing larger number of weaned animals.
Inadequate cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and
viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta, soiled
bedding, dirt and debris and must be sanitized at least every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary
enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and soiled bedding.
Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(4) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning, sanitation, and fresh bedding were provided to guinea pigs in rows 1 and 4 on Saturday, November 15,
2014. Although the licensee has purchased a disinfectant recommended by the attending veterinarian and
attempted to sanitize those enclosures, the current sanitation does not appear adequate. Dried fecal material and
significant dirt and debris remained in the cages especially on upper edges and shelves and the areas under the
automatic watering lines where the wire attaches to the wood of the primary enclosure. The wood in this area
appears darkly discolored and moist. The presence of organic material such as this makes disinfectants ineffective.
The sanitation program has not been started yet in rows 2 and 3, although cleaning and fresh bedding was
provided to guinea pig in these enclosures on Wednesday, November 12, 2014. Lack of sanitation program
exposes the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Guinea pigs arebeing treated for hair loss and presumed ringworm. Correct by ensuring that all organic material is removed from
primary enclosures prior to disinfection and ensuring that all primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2
weeks or as necessary with proper agents to sufficiently disinfect all surfaces of the enclosure. Sanitation of primary
enclosures is necessary to minimize risk of disease to the animals housed therein.
Remains uncorrected.
3.32 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The facility still does not have a sufficient number of employees to adequately care for the number of guinea pigs
housed and to keep up with the general conditions of the facility. This facility continues to be cited for cleaning,
sanitation, housekeeping and veterinary care. The sanitation program has not started yet in rows 2 and 3. Daily
observations and treatment for animals are not being done adequately. Insufficient employees allows cleaning,
sanitation, housekeeping and veterinary care to fall behind. These conditions pose a health risk to the animals.
Correct by ensuring that an adequate number of employees are present to adequately care for the guinea pigs so
that appropriate animal health and husbandry are maintained.
Remains uncorrected.
Inspection was conducted with the licensee on 17 November 2014, at which time all animals requiring veterinary
care were identified to the licensee. The report was delivered and exit briefing was conducted with licensee on 18
November 2014.
