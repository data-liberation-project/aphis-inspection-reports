ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were several medications that did not have the complete labeling. They were missing the veterinarian's
name, the date of expiration, and the animal for which it was prescribed.
Such information is necessary, for example, to ensure the correct animal is receiving the medication and to be able
to contact the prescribing veterinarian for any follow-up that might be needed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the goat enclosure at the Moorpark facility, there are two areas of the sheet roof that had exposed sharp edges.
The sharp edges are located at a level where the animals could injure themselves when climbing on the roof.
There was also rusting, irregular, and exposed sharp edges on the door of the truck that was used as a climbing
structure. The sharp edges are located at a level where the animals could injure themselves when climbing.
Animal housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. A system of facility
monitoring and maintenance is necessary for optimal health and well-being of the animal.

3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Although there were some structures to provide shade, immature goats housed in an outdoor facility would not have
adequate shade to protect them depending on the time of day. Therefore, these animals would be exposed to direct
sunlight. Having inadequate shade and being exposed to sun for long periods of time can lead to discomfort and overheating
of the animal. Young animals have a harder time cooling and maintaining body temperature.
Adequate shade must be provided for all animals.
