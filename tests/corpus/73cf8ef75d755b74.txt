ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog identified as ID #4089 had red gums and moderate dental tartar calculus on the majority of its teeth. Moderate
dental issues are painful for dogs and can impact their normal eating habits and lead to secondary systemic issues.
The same dog also had an inter-digital cyst on the right rear paw, this can cause unnecessary pain or discomfort.
This dog should be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to address these issues. The attending veterinarian
should add a routine dental plan to the program of vet care for the dogs at the facility.
There are currently medications within the facility that are not labeled with any veterinary instructions or directions
with how to use them or who they should be used for. These include PPG and an eye ointment. Without the proper
instructions or identification it is possible to misuse the medication and harm the animal. The facility is responsible
to ensure the health and safety of all their animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cut holes in the PVC pipes used in the kennel cages for supplying water to the dogs were worn in some areas from
being overly chewed on. These worn areas of the pipes displayed jagged edges that can injure the dogs when
drinking, in addition these chewed areas can trap debris and cannot be properly sanitized.
The wire mesh coating on the floor and door panels of some of the kennels was coming off. Some of these door
panels were showing signs of rust which can over time affect the structural integrity of the doors. Enclosures must
be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed
or replaced when worn or soiled.

3.2(d)INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The seal on the wood frame in the whelping kennels have deep and extensive scratch and chew marks on them
which exposes the unsealed wood underneath. These areas are no longer impervious to moisture and now cannot
be properly cleaned and sanitized. Routine maintenance and repair of any surface in contact with the animals must
be impervious to moisture to ensure proper cleaning and sanitation to prevent the spread of disease.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was a layer of grime and debris along several of the feeders in the main kennel and whelping room. These
feeders need to be cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks to reduce this accumulation of grime and for
the health of the dogs.
