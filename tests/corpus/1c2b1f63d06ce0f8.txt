2.31(d)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The umbrella rabbit antibody production protocol was submitted to the IACUC by the principal investigator and the
same individual (PI) approved the protocol as the current IACUC chair.
With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall review protocols
and amendments to protocols prior to approval. No member may participate in the IACUC review or approval of an
activity in which that member has a conflicting interest (e.g., is personally involved in the activity).

2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The umbrella rabbit antibody production protocol describes that "rabbits will weigh at least 4 kg prior to blood
collection" and "collecting 40-50ml whole blood per rabbit each time" and "rabbits are bled every two weeks", "Each
rabbit will be used approximately 4 times".
There is not enough detail in the protocol to ensure that the animals are allowed to regenerate their blood volume
between bleeds because there is no discussion of maximum volume per body weight, monitoring body weight or
hematocrit to ensure that the animals are not in distress. The bleed schedules reviewed had two rabbits on every
other week bleeds for 6 bleeds. The protocol says approximately 4 bleeds, and sometimes the course of the project
is extended past that but there is no mention of monitoring the animal for additional bleeds.
There must be sufficient detail in the protocol for the IACUC to understand the use of the animals and evaluate the
impact of the research projects on the animal in order to approve the protocol.
