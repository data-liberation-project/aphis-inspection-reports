3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Seven outdoor enclosures housing approximately 24 large breed dogs had over a days worth of feces. The
enclosures contained enough feces that the dogs were walking through it to maneuver through the enclosure. There
were areas in the enclosures where the accumulated fecal matter was enough the gravel flooring could not be seen.
The licensee stated the enclosures had not been cleaned in a while because the weather doesn’t allow it.
Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease hazards and create an unhealthy environment for the
animals. The licensee must ensure that all waste material is removed from the primary enclosures daily as required.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Throughout the facility there were broken wires causing sharp points. The facility, had multiple areas along the
enclosure fencing, divider panels and the ground that had tie wires, broken wires and/or loose wires causing sharp
points that affected approximately 34 dogs. Most of these sharp points were wires used for fastening or were broken
wires that had sharp ends which were protruding into the enclosures at the dogs' level. The sharp points can injure
the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs.

3.6(c)(1)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At the time of inspection the primary enclosure of a individually housed young dog was not of appropriate size to
allow for 6 inches of head space above the dogs head while in a normal standing position. Failure to provide dogs
with adequate head space may not allow for freedom of movement and normal postural behaviors. Licensee must
provide primary enclosures for dogs that include at a minimum of 6 inches of head space above the dogs’ heads to
ensure the dog’s health and well-being.
To be corrected immediately.3.8(a)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
An enclosure containing a single young dog did not have the two times of required floor space for the dog and the
dog was not being provided the opportunity to exercise regularly. Not providing the dogs regular opportunities to
exercise when the dogs are housed individually in an enclosure that is less than two times the required floor space
for that dog doesn't ensure that the dogs have enough room or are getting enough exercise to meet their physical
and mental needs. The licensee must ensure dogs are either being provided regular opportunities to exercise or the
dogs must be provided enclosures that are more than two times the required floor space for each dog.
To be corrected immediately.
