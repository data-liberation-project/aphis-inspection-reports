ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A cream colored adult female Lhasa Apso (microchip number 068 825 363) has a growth under her belly. The
growth is hanging about two inches below the normal body frame, soft and approximately four inches long. The
breeder has talked to her veterinarian about this, but no diagnoses have been made. The breeder said the dog had
this growth about a year ago and it is getting bigger. The dog owner must take this dog to a veterinarian and get a
good evaluation of this dog to insure that the proper and best care for this dog is being given.
* A reddish/blond Pekinese (microchip number 101 258 797) has an open wound on the top side, between her
second and third toes of her left front foot. The open wound is red and oozing. Open wounds with no veterinarian
care can become infected, painful, and lead to more permanent paralysis. The breeder must have this open wound
seen by a veterinarian. The breeder needs to develop a plan to actively inspect all dogs on a daily basis. Have in
place a procedure set up by the attending veterinarian that correctly medicates open wounds, keep a record of what
is being done and have it available for the inspector to see during the inspection process.
3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The four pens against the east inside wall of the sheltered facility have aluminum corners dogs have chewed
leaving sharp points. Sharp points can injure dogs. The licensee must remove, replace or repair these areas that
have sharp points. This will help ensure dogs are in a safe environment and also help in the proper cleaning and
sanitizing of these areas. The licensee needs to also put into place a good maintenance program. Correct by

3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The lower third of the galvanized sheet of tin attached to the east side of the exterior wall of the sheltered facility
is rusted; Rust is covering an estimated 20 to 30 percent of the surface area of four enclosures where dogs are.
Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure
that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis so those surfaces can be readily cleaned and sanitized at alltimes or be replaced when worn. The licensee must remove, paint, or repair this part of the siding that is rusty to
help insure that good cleaning and sanitizing practice can take place to help maintain a disease free environment
for dogs.
3.6(a)(2)(12)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The plastic coated wire flooring of the outside dog runs on the south side of the sheltered facility is losing its
covering. Wire flooring that is not at least a diameter of 9 gauge must be coated with a material such as plastic or
fiberglass. Inadequate flooring can lead to sore feet and open wounds. Dogs must have safe flooring to stay
healthy and comfortable. The licensee must repair or replace the areas of flooring that are not adequately coated.

3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Dust, cobwebs and dog hair were accumulating on the interior walls, ceiling and enclosure pens of the sheltered
facility. This indicates a living area exists for rodents, other pests and other vermin. Unsanitary living conditions
are created if the building is not kept clean and this could lead to health issues for the dogs. The licensee needs to
put into place a good program that continually keeps areas where dogs are clean of cobwebs. Also, surfaces
where dogs come into contact must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks and more often if
needed to help maintain a disease free facility for dogs. The licensee must clean/remove the cobwebs from the
inside of the sheltered facility where dogs are housed
