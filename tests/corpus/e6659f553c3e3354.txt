3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is not following their parasite prevention program on the Program of Veterinary Care. The prevention program
states Heartgard will be given to adult dogs, who are not pregnant or nursing, every other month. The 3 dogs (Rico, Ruby
and Cooper) that were supposed to receive their Heartgard in May have not received them as of today's inspection.

Not following the parasite prevention program puts the dog's at risk for contracting parasites and does not ensure the
dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care. Treatment of parasites and other pests (including fleas, worms, coccidia,
giardia, and heartworm) must be in accordance with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian. The facility must
give Heartgard to the dogs that are not pregnant or nursing per the Program of Veterinary Care and follow the parasite
control program from this day forward.

To be corrected by: 18-June-2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
