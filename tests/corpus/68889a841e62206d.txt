2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Recently the facility acquired a bobcat. The new species has not been added to the program of vet care and the
vet is not aware that there is a new species at the facility. Additionally the current PVC was signed last month but at
the vet(cid:25)s office. Per this regulation, the vet needs to come to the facility for regularly scheduled visits. This is to
assure the vet is aware of the animals at the facility and able to provide adequate guidance for their health and well-
being. This guidance should cover frequency of parasite control programs, vaccines and diets for species.
