2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care dated 7-24-15 is still the most current version. No changes have been made
since the last inspection. The program is still incomplete lacking information in many areas. There is no information
regarding dosages and frequency of administration of any drugs for the control of internal, blood and external
parasites and vaccines. There is simply a statement that the veterinarian does not administer these drugs.
Conversations with staff and the owner show that the animals are currently being dewormed orally and treated with
fly spray. The section in the PC regarding capture methods states that rompum and ace are to be used but does not
state who will be administering these drugs and if the facility staff is to do so what dosages they should use for the
different species. There is nothing written regarding any TB testing of susceptible species to include some of the
hoofstock and the non-human primates.
The facility and the attending veterinarian need to jointly decide on all preventative veterinary procedures, drugs and
vaccines to be administered to the animals even if they are going to be administered by the facility staff. The
instructions for these procedures, drugs and vaccines should be detailed in written form and then the facility shall
ensure that they are followed. The facility shall document and maintain a written program of veterinary care
approved by the attending veterinarian to ensure the appropriate health care for the animals at the facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At least three of the goats observed today are in need of trimming of their hooves. The hooves are longer than
appropriate and are starting to turn in and up. These long hooves can lead to discomfort to the animal and over time
will lead to abnormal locomotion and potential joint/muscle issues. The facility shall supply appropriate hoof care
services to maintain normal hoof conformation for the goats. Correct by Nov. 2, 2015.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure currently housing the African Crested porcupine does not sufficiently provide protection from theelements including todays rain. There is a pet taxi type crate available in which the porcupine was staying but it is
designed with openings for ventilation, has one small side completely open (where door usually is) and has holes in
the roof made by the porcupine. The numerous openings do not keep out the cold, wind and rain. Lack of adequate
protection from the elements can lead to discomfort and potential distress. The porcupine needs to be supplied with
shelter appropriate for the animal to afford it protection from and to prevent discomfort from inclement weather.
Correct by 10/27/15.
Consultation with a veterinarian/treatment has been provided for the deer and snow macaque cited under 2.40b2 on
the previous inspection.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
