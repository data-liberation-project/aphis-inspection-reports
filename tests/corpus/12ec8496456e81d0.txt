ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) on file is incomplete. The alpaca needs to be added to the written
program so that a preventative program is established for this animal. The veterinarian should give specific
guidance on routine vaccinations, parasite control as well as an emergency plan for veterinary care for this animal.
This is to ensure that the attending veterinarian is aware of all treatments taking place so that he animal is given
appropriate care.
Injectable ivomec is listed for parasite control for the pigs and goats, but does not name the type of ivermectin,
dosage, or concentration. The licensee must ensure that he has adequate guidance from the attending veterinarian
on all medications and treatments including the name of the drug, dosage, concentration, and route of
administration. The program of veterinary care must be complete to provide adequate guidance to the licensee to
maintain the health of the animals. The written program of veterinary care on file must be updated to include the
alpaca. The type of ivermectin dosage, and concentration must be listed to ensure the animals receive proper care.
