ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00p.m. on
06/23/2016. During that time, the inspector knocked on the door of the home on the property. The inspector spoke
with a family member who indicated that the licensee was away from the property would not be home until the
evening.
Lack of availability for inspection prevents any oversight by APHIS Officials in enforcement of the Animal Welfare
Act.
Correct by establishing optimal hours for inspection with the home inspector, and ensuring that a responsible adult
is
available during those times for inspection. Correct from this time forward.
