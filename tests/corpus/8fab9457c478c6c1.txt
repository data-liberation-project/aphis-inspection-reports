ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult fawn and white female Chihuahua (tag number 1410) is missing its right eye and the left eye is cloudy in
appearance. The dog also has a blue spot on its left eye. The licensee stated the dog was purchased that way and
was not currently being treated. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, allergies,
injury, irritation or other medical conditions and can be painful. Not having clear vision can cause discomfort
affecting the health and well-being of the dog. The potential for injury exists if the dog is not able to clearly see. The
animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administered. Documentation should
be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must be part of their
documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
To be corrected be September 16, 2014.
Exit interview conducted with licensee.
