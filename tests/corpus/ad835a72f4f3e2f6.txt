2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
One group of otters at a time are shifted off and on public exhibit at an hourly interval by allowing them to run
through the housing room past a pen of other otters. Otters in both pens vocalize very loudly and vigorously
attempt to fight under the edges of acrylic material on the cage fronts. The material has gaps that permit contact
through the chain link. Loud vocalizations and aggressive behavior are indicators of behavioral stress, and can lead
to physical harm. The facility must handle animals in a manner that does not cause behavioral stress.

3.133(a) CRITICAL
SEPARATION.
Otter pens were separated by a chain link panel which permitted contact with the other group of animals. Otters
fought through the gaps in the chain link panel, resulting in traumatic injury to the forelimb of one otter that required
amputation. The facility remedied the problem by separately housing the injured otter until full recovery of the
surgical site, and by installing acrylic panels between pens over the chain link to prevent direct access between
pens before reintroducing the injured otter to her group. The facility must ensure that animals are not be housed
near animals that interfere with their health or cause them discomfort, such as the physical trauma incurred between
these two otters that resulted in loss of a limb from one otter. Correct by: the facility mounted acrylic panels
between the two pens to prevent the otters from having direct contact and added a pen to allow for separate
housing of animals.
