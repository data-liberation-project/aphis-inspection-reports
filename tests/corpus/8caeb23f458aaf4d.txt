2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The facility failed to notify Animal Care that they closed a business site. The inspector arrived at Site 003 to find the store
empty and the space available for rent. This is a substantial change in business locations and requires notifying Animal
Care 90 days prior to making the change.
It is important that Animal Care is kept up to date regarding sites that have been opened and closed so that inspectors
can adequately inspect licensed facilities and their regulated animals.
Correct by October 12, 2022 by notifying Animal Care at animalcare@usda.gov at least 90 days prior to any change in
name, address, management, locations, activities, number or type of animals.
