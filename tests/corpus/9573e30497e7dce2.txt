Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1132 on 01-Sep-20.

Upon arrival at the facility, the inspector honked twice, then called the primary phone number and left a voice mail when
there was no answer. The inspector then heard back from the licensee that she was not available on this day. After the
interaction, the inspector left the facility.
