Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC completed their semi-annual facility inspection in April of 2022. There was no documentation available (such
as in the IACUC meeting minutes, IACUC semi-annual evaluation letter to Institutional Official, or any other
checklists/documents) that indicated that the IACUC completed a review of the facility's program for humane care and use
of animals at that time. The facility representative stated that such as review was not completed.
The IACUC is required to complete both a facility inspection and a review of the program for humane care and use of
animals semi-annually to ensure that the facility is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations and standards.
The facility shall, going forward, review at least once every six months the research facility's program for humane care
and use of animals using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A-Animal Welfare as the basis for the evaluation. Correct by Oct
30, 2022.
2.31(d)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
The facility used a method other than the full committee review or designated member review to approve newly submitted
protocols. The facility hired a new director/Principal Investigator. The teaching protocols being used were updated to
reflect the change in the Principal Investigator and submitted to the IACUC for review as required. Based on emails


reviewed, the IACUC chair emailed the protocols to the IACUC members for review. After receiving reply emails from the
members stating that the IACUC members approved of the protocols, the protocols were considered approved. This
polling of IACUC members is not an approval method considered in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.
Full committee review or designated member review are the two approved methods of protocol approval and one of them
must be used to ensure a fair and complete review of all protocols and modifications to protocols.
The current teaching protocols shall be reviewed by the IACUC and granted approval either by a majority approval of a
quorum of the members of the committee at a convened meeting or if no member requests full committee review by a
qualified IACUC member designated by the chairman to conduct the review. Correct by Aug 30, 2022.
2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Several teaching protocols did not contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals or contained a
description that was not in congruence with the procedures listed/title of the protocol. The EH, ECPC, PITE, and RE
protocols need additional information to provide a complete description of the proposed use of the animals. The VH
protocol contains a description for procedures other than those listed to be completed under that protocol.
All protocols shall include a complete description of the proposed use of the animals to allow the IACUC to provide
appropriate review and oversight. For teaching protocols a complete description should include a description of the
procedures to be performed by the students and concerns such as the number of procedures to be performed on each
animal.
In order to be compliant the protocols listed must be modified to contain a complete description and thereafter approved
by the IACUC in order for animals to be used in protocol activities. All protocols to conduct an activity involving animals
must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals. Correct by Aug. 30, 2022.

Facilities, general.
Two outdoor housing facility issues need attention.
*The fence starting at the barn housing the animals and extending along the parking lot area is not structurally sound for
one approximately 8 foot long section. There is a gap of about 6-7 inches between the bottom of the fence and the
ground. The fence is slightly loose due to the goats rubbing along it. Unwanted animals may use the gap to enter the
enclosure and scare or harm the facility's animals.
*An old unstable add-on structure to the large tobacco barn was removed for safety reasons recently however there
remains a piece of metal nailed to a section of the wood exterior of the barn that is loose and partially torn. One side and
the bottom of this metal piece are loose and the resulting sharp edge may lead to injury if the animals rub against it.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. Correct by 8/15/22.

This inspection was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian and a vet tech. The exit interview was conducted with the
Attending Veterinarian.
