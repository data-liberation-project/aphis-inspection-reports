PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At least twelve large breed puppies (German Shepherds, Golden Retrievers and Bernadoodles) are housed in
transport enclosures that do not allow for the puppies to stand and sit in a normal upright, erect position. The
inability to sit or stand in a normal erect position could have a negative impact on the well-being of the puppies.
Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats must be large enough to ensure that each animal contained
in the primary enclosure has enough space to turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in
a natural position. The licensee must ensure that the transport enclosures are large enough to allow each puppy to
sit and stand in a normal erect position.
Correction date: From this day forward.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the driver of the transport vehicle.
