ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 13:30 on
06-Mar-17.Upon arrival I spoke with a representative who stated the licensee was ill and not able to come out for
the inspection process. The second facility representative was away from the facility and would not be able to return
for the process until that evening. Please contact me with your current hours of availability.
This is the first attempted inspection.
