2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public can walk along the enclosure housing the yaks. At the time of this inspection the male yak was observed
to ram his head at the enclosure fence when members of the public were present. On one occasion he managed to
get the tip of his right horn through one of the open links of the chain link fence. The yak could potentially injure a
person while ramming at the fence. Ensure the safety of the public with sufficient barriers or distance between the
animal enclosure and the public walkway. Correct by August 31, 2016.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Two chipmunks were observed to scurry away from the feed bin located by the truck garage and areas of urine
staining and fecal pellets were also observed on and around the feed bin. The presence of chipmunks, combined
with the areas of visible excreta indicate that rodent pests have access to the feed bin and may be contaminating
the food contained within. Establish a pest control system that prevents the rodents from having access to the feed
bin. Correct by August 31, 2016.
