RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on June 15, 2015, records of animal births and deaths were not maintained for the
months of September, October or January for the guinea pigs. Records must be kept on animals for tracking
purposes, assessment of the animal care program, and to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee
must ensure that records on animal births and deaths are kept and maintained. Correct from this day forward.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Heating. The temperature in the guinea pig building was below 60 degrees F. during the inspection. The
temperature fluctuated in the guinea pig building from a low of 55.7 degrees F. to a high of 58.5 degrees F. during
the inspection. The lowest temperature reading was measured adjacent to the guinea pig enclosures on the north
side of the building and the highest temperature was recorded adjacent to the enclosures near the wood stove. At
that time the vent in the middle of the ceiling was fully opened allowing heat to escape from the animal room. The
propane wall mounted heater on the north side of the building was turned off during the inspection.
Animals may become ill if temperature is not closely monitored and kept between 60-85 degrees Fahrenheit. The
licensee must ensure that the temperature is maintained at acceptable levels throughout the entire facility
regardless of changing conditions outside. Continued monitoring of the temperature in the guinea pig building is
necessary with changing weather. Adjustments to the heaters and vents must be made to keep the ambient
temperature from falling
below 60 degrees F. or exceeding 85 degrees F. when guinea pigs are present. Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
