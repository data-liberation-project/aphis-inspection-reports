Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Male shih-tzu (microchip #941000017056453) has an abnormal condition of the eyes. Both eyes appear cloudy and an
opaque area is located in the center of each eye. The edges of the opaque area have a blueish tint and the the white of
both eyes has developed a slight redness. The facility has not noticed the condition of the dog's eyes and no treatment
was currently being provided. Abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. This dog must
be evaluated by a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. The licensee must
ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

provided minimum floor space could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals.


Each dog housed in a primary enclosure must be provided a minimum amount of flor space. The licensee must ensure
that each dog is provided with the minimum amount of required floor space in order to support their health and well-being.

3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the 2 adult rooms, housing at least 140 dogs, the metal feeders are only sanitized approximately once a month and the
surfaces of the enclosures are not sanitized every two weeks. Failure to properly sanitize surfaces could increase the risk
of disease towards the dogs.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and
more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The
licensee must ensure all surfaces within the enclosure including the self-feeders are sanitized at least once every two
weeks in order to protect the health and well-being of the dogs.
