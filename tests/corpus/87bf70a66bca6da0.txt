Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
* No written program of veterinary care was available at the time of inspection. The written program of veterinary
care is required for facilities which do not employ a full-time veterinarian. The program of veterinary care is a written
agreement between the licensee and the attending veterinarian. Formal arrangements shall include regularly scheduled
visits to the premise of the licensee. The program of veterinarian care establishes standards of care for the animals. A
completed written program of veterinary care is important for the care of the animals and ensures clear and accurate
communication between the facility and the attending vet. The licensee must have a completed program of veterinary
care available for review during inspections. To be corrected by 1/11/21
