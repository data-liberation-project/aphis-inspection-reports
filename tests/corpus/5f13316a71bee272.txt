ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were four chinchillas with signs of health problems that were not being treated and need veterinary attention:
-Black female eartag #33 had a red, hairless swelling under her chin.
-White female's right eye (no ID, in enclosure C-5) was swollen shut, hairless around the eyelids.
-Grey/silver female with eartag GROS 996 had a hairless swellings on the undersides of her bottom jaw.

Indirect Non-compliances:
There were three chinchillas with signs of health problems that were not being treated and need veterinary
treatment:
-A pink-white male's (no ID) right eyelids were red and had some dried discharge around it.
-A black/silver female(GROS 95) was squinting in its right eye and had some discharge around it.
-A grey/silver female (no ID) had excessively matted fur on its stomach; the hair mats were firm and crusted
attached closely to the skin. Intervention from the attending veterinarian is needed to ensure removal of these mats
is done without distressing this chinchilla.
***Untreated medical problems can worsen and cause pain in affected animals and can be contagious to other
animals in the building. The veterinarian must be contacted to properly diagnose and treat each animal's health
problem and the facility must follow the recommended treatment. Documentation of the diagnosis and treatment
plan for animals must be available for APHIS officials for future inspections.

The facility had identified at least ten chinchillas and was treating their conditions, however seven chinchillas had
problems that were pointed out by inspectors and haven't received treatment for their conditions due to not being
noticed by the facility:
-Black female eartag #33 had a red, hairless swelling under her chin.-White female's right eye (no ID, in enclosure C-5) was swollen shut, hairless around the eyelids.
-Grey/silver female with eartag GROS 996 had a hairless swellings on the undersides of her bottom jaw.

-A black/silver female(GROS 95) was squinting in its right eye and had some discharge around it.

The facility must refine its method of routine daily observations to ensure any animal with a health problem is
identified and treated promptly per the attending veterinarian's instructions.
3.125(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility reports that all enclosures were checked for holes last week and we noted that some with holes were
marked for repair and did not have animals in them, however six enclosures were noted to have holes with sharp
points sticking into the enclosures. Some of the holes were large enough a chinchilla could potentially escape from
the enclosure. In addition, the licensee informed us during inspection that a chinchilla was loose in the facility
because it had bound against the enclosure door and sprung it open. Holes with sharp points could result in the
chinchilla getting injured either from contact with the sharp points or from going through the holes. Enclosures must
be maintained in good repair to prevent animal injury or escape.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
