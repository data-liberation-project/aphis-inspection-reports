Facilities, general.
The outdoor housing shed for the rabbits had insulation panels on the walls that were chewed and/or pecked and dangled
loosely from the walls. Ingestion of insulation may be detrimental to the health and welfare of the rabbits. If the housing
is insulated, materials used for insulation must be maintained and protected from ingestion for the health of the rabbits.
The facility must ensure that the housing is maintained in good repair.

The facility removed the materials from the housing at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
