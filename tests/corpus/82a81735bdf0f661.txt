ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the sheltered facility there was an adult Cocker Spaniel identified as #95600008888325 (Lollie) that had
grayish/white and brown build up on the back teeth. Some of the teeth were encased in the substance. The top gum
lines were rough, reddened and receded with a yellowish/white substance in the receded area. The last facility
inspection by the attending veterinarian was in February 2015. The paperwork states that this dog was to have a
dental performed within six months, which would have been by August 23, 2015. The facility representative made
an appointment with a veterinarian during the inspection. Dental care is essential for prevention of infection, oral
injuries, disease and promotes the overall health of the animal. The licensee must assure that all of the animals
receive adequate veterinary care as required.

RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
***While reviewing records, from 9/25/15 through 11/22/15, there were 29 puppies sold that have no acquisition
records. Some of the breeds on the paperwork were breeds that were seen within the facility, yet the inspectors
were unable to tell if those puppies actually came from this facility or were purchased from another facility. The
facility representative stated that several of the puppies did come from this facility. Puppies sold included: Shih-Tzu-
4, Boston Terrier- 6, Beagle- 10, German Shepherd- 2 and Shih-Poo- 7. Appropriate documentation for acquired
and sold animals is essential for proper identification, tracing forward and trace back of the animal. The licensee
must correctly document all broker records and assure that all records are kept as required.
This inspection began at 0951.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative, Bill Heine, ACI and Bev Hicks,
