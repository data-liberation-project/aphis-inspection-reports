ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In enclosure #13L, juvenile black/yellow guinea pig is unable to bear weight on both front legs. Both front legs are
laid out across the flooring and the front feet turn outwards. The guinea pig is observed to move by walking/hopping
with the hind legs and bearing weight on the chest, neck and chin. The facility representative stated that this animal
is not receiving veterinary treatment for it's condition. The inability to bear weight on the fore legs could indicate a
serious underlying condition and may limit this guinea pig's ability to escape any aggressive behaviors from other
animals.
This guinea pig must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must ensure adequate veterinary care is provided to all the animals at all times.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility is using Chlorhexidine Solution to sanitize the enclosures. The guinea pigs are not removed from the
enclosure, but herded to one side while the sanitizer is sprayed in the enclosure. The attending veterinarian has
provided written instructions that the guinea pigs are to be removed from the enclosure or use dividers to keep the
animals from being contaminated by the spray. Contamination of the guinea pigs by the sanitizing spray could have
a negative impact on the health of the animals.
Handling of animals, including cleaning, must be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
harm, stress or unnecessary discomfort. The licensee must ensure that the animals are removed or a divider is
placed between the animals and the spray to ensure that they do not come into contact with the sanitizer.

3.25(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The front walls of the enclosures are only 5.5 inches to 6.5 inches high. The facility representative stated that the
guinea pigs do occasionally escape their enclosures. Failure of the enclosure to contain the guinea pigs could
cause the animals to become injured and may not allow for appropriate access to food and water.
Indoor housing facilities must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, protect the animals from injury,
contain the animals and stop other animals from entering. The licensee must alter the enclosures in a manner that
prevents the guinea pigs from escaping.
