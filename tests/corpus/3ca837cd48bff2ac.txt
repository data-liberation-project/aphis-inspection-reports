2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, there is an enclosure containing three, live, adult dwarf hamsters, one deceased adult hamster,
and the desiccated carcasses of four juvenile hamsters among the bedding. There was also one adult hamster in a
separate enclosure with an ~0.75cm, linear skin wound on the right shoulder. The licensee stated that she had not
noticed any problems with the animals since she last observed them, a few days before. The live hamsters were
transferred to a clean cage and the wound was cleaned at the time of inspection.
Failure to note illness, injuries or other health or behavioral problems delays reporting to the veterinarian and delays
veterinary attention. This can lead to worsening of a condition, prolong animal discomfort and suffering, and/or result in
death. Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well being must be done to ensure animals are in good
health, and a mechanism of direct and frequent communication must be utilized so that timely and accurate information
on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.


The licensee does not have records of disposition for any of the animals that were sold or otherwise removed from the
inventory since March 23, 2022, nor a current, written inventory of animals on-hand. Records containing the required
information for animals on-hand, animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring
born on premises, are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use. The licensee shall
make, keep and maintain an inventory of animals on-hand, as well as records of acquisition and disposition for all
animals, that fully and correctly disclose the required information.
3.53(c)(2) Critical

Primary enclosures.
There is a 35", round, metal enclosure housing three adult and four juvenile rabbits that provides a total of 6.68 square
feet of floor area (including the area unavailable due to the food and water receptacles on the cage floor). The animals in
this enclosure require a minimum of 15.0 square feet total, not including the space occupied by food and water
receptacles. The rabbits were separated into clean, larger cages at the time of inspection.
Overcrowding prevents animals from moving freely and getting adequate exercise, causes stress, can lead to
incompatibility and encourages the spread of disease and illness. Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be
provided the minimum floor space according to their bodyweight (as listed in the regulations), exclusive of the floor area
taken up by food and water receptacles.
