FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(c) Drainage. Throughout the shelter (barn) of the outdoor enclosure for 3 adult reindeers is an excess
accumulation of standing water mixed with mud. The animals have to walk through the mixed mud and water to
access the feeder. There are no dry areas within the shelter for the animal to lie down or stand in without getting
wet. Standing water and mud may result in odors, spreading of diseases, and other health hazards. Enclosures
housing animals must have an adequate drainage system that is able to eliminate standing and excess water more
rapidly for the overall health of the animals.
A suitable method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. The method of drainage shall comply with
applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of the
environment.
