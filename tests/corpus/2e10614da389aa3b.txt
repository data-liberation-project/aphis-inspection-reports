2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Official USDA dog on hand sheets (7005's) had 32 dogs recorded, but there were eleven adult dogs counted by
the inspector. When the records and dogs at the facility do not match it makes the records incomplete. Complete
and accurate records are needed to ensure each animal’s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the
ability to trace dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all times at their
facility. Correct by 3/25/20.
3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Rusted, jagged metal was observed along the bottom of an estimated three metal enclosure gates and one
divider panel. Five dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in sheltered and outdoor housing. The
surfaces were rough in appearance. Rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces to the point that the metal
surfaces can no longer be readily cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust affects the structural integrity of all metal
surfaces. The licensee must ensure that this and all other surfaces are free of rust that prevents the required
cleaning and sanitation, or affects the structural strength of the surface. Correct by 3/10/20
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The facility has no current effective pest prevention program in place. Bird droppings were observed
accumulating on top of the sheltered enclosures and on the floor next to the enclosures. The affected areas are
located on the interior of the reefer unit converted to a dog housing unit. No means to control or eliminate the birds
were viewed during the inspection. Lack of an effective program that controls birds can create unsanitary conditions
and lead to potential health risks. Bird feces may contain pathogens that could adversely impact animal health.
The licensee must establish an effective program for the control of birds and mammals that are pests, must be
established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by
pests in the animal areas. The licensee must have an effective program for the control of insects, external parasites
affecting dogs and cats, birds and mammals that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote
the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct by 3/10/20.* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 2/25/20 were conducted with the licensee.
