ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care is not being followed. The program states all animals must be tested for
Brucellosis prior to breeding. Annual heartworm testing and monthly preventative also must be done. A monthly
treatment for ticks and fleas must be used. The licensee is not following any of these veterinary recommendations.
Each dealer shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provisions of
adequate veterinary care and oversee all other aspects of animal care.
The program of veterinary care has to be followed as written by the attending veterinarian to ensure the health of
the animals.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The majority of the adult breeding dogs have overgrown toenails. Four of the five dogs checked during inspection
have dental issues: Two female Yorkies with USDA tags #661 and #5, one untagged, overweight female Husky,
and one untagged female black Labrador Retriever. They all have a large accumulation of hard, brown buildup on
their teeth. This buildup has caused the gums to recede and become red and inflamed. The same female black
Labrador Retriever and an untagged male Standard Poodle also have dark brown, odorous discharge in their ears.
The Standard Poodle has excessive hair in his ears with large accumulations of dark brown, odorous material
clumped in it. Both dogs shook their heads repeatedly during inspection.
Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend,
and holiday care;Overgrown toenails must be clipped to prevent injury to the dog. The attending veterinarian needs to complete
physical exams on these dogs, and the complete kennel prior to December 7, 2016, the date on the PVC, to assess
their need for veterinary care. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and plan shall be
maintained for examination by APHIS officials.

Daily observations must be made of all animals to asses their health and well-being. If these observations are
conducted by the licensee, a plan must be established for direct communication with the attending veterinarian on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being.
The attending veterinarian must be contacted each time there are problems with animal health. This is to ensure
that health issues are addressed and treated promptly. Appropriate, timely treatment relieves pain and assures
animal well-being.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The large breed adult dogs are micro-chipped and the licensee does not have a microchip reader on hand. The
small breed dogs are tagged. The puppies over 4 months of age have tags on their kennels with confusing ID
numbers on them. One number was printed at the time of tag manufacture, a second number has been added
either in marker or hand engraved. It is difficult to determine which number is supposed to be the dog's ID. The
Licensee was unable to clarify this numbering system at the time of inspection. Puppy cage cards are used for ID
and records. These cage cards are lacking information and have some information, such as puppies, scratched
out. Health records cannot be accurately maintained without definitive animal identification, as a result, animal
health may suffer.All live dogs held on the premises, purchased, or otherwise acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of, or removed
from the premises for delivery to a research facility or exhibitor or to another dealer, or for sale, through an auction
sale or to any person for use as a pet, shall be identified by an official tag of the type described in Sec. 2.51 affixed
to the animal's neck by means of a collar made of material generally considered acceptable to pet owners as a
means of identifying their pet dogs.
All dogs, four months of age and older, must either be micro-chipped or have USDA tags for identification. If the
licensee chooses to use micro-chips, a micro-chip reader must be readily available and maintained in working order.
If puppy cage cards are used for ID and as records, all required information must be contained on the card. The
cards must be saved at the kennel for a minimum of one year after the puppies leave the premises.
2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records of disposition of puppies (APHIS Forms 7006) do not have the USDA license number of the facility to
which the puppies were sold. They contain only a name and phone number. Puppy ID numbers on these forms
also do not match the cage cards made by the facility. Licensee stated a litter of small breed puppies was sold
without completing a form 7006, so there is no record at all for the sale of these puppies. In the event of a disease
outbreak, it is impossible to trace animals without accurate records.
Each breeder shall maintain records of sales that include all required information such as: USDA license number,
name, address, etc...
Include all required information on APHIS forms 7006 and accurately identify all dogs and puppies sold.
2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The ID numbers on the APHIS forms 7005 do not match those on the dogs in the kennel. Consistent, accurate
recordings of animal IDs assure proper history, evaluations, and treatments are maintained for health and
husbandry.
Each dealer shall use Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) to make, keep and
maintain the information required by regulation for all dogs held at the facility.Ensure that all information kept on the APHIS Form 7005 is correct and matches all animals held in the kennel.
To be corrected from now on.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several bags of dog food are stored in the garage on the cement floor.
Supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation. Food supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and
around the bags.
Store bagged dog food off the floor to prevent moisture from wicking into the bags and contaminating the food.

3.4(a)(1)(iii)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
A Husky whelped in an outdoor shelter approximately 5 weeks ago, has 5 puppies, and has never been moved into
the whelping building. This shelter, and all of the other outdoor large breed shelters, have no insulation, no heat
source, and no lighting. Temperatures at night have been as low as 29 degrees. These puppies receive no light,
and have been in the dark for the entirety of their lives. The shelter has no windows and the doggy door does not
allow penetration of daylight. The only glimpse of light they receive is when the mother goes out the doggy door, or
when a caretaker opens the back door of the shelter. Large breed puppies born in these shelters cannot get out of
the doggy door, that is approximately 8 to 10 inches above the floor, until they are at least 5-8 weeks old.
The following categories of dogs must not be kept in outdoor facilities, unless that practice is specifically approved
by the attending veterinarian: Sick, infirm, aged or young.
Young dogs must not be kept in outdoor facilities unless approved by the attending veterinarian. Uniform diurnal
lighting, either natural or artificial, must be provided to all dogs at the facility for their well-being and proper
development.
To be corrected by November 25 2016.3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two of the outdoor kennels have shelters with doggy doors that do not shut properly. This leaves a gap at the door
approximately 4-6 inches wide. Exposure to wind, cold, and inclement weather through this gap is a health risk for
the dogs.
Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs must contain a roof, four sides, and a floor, and must provide a wind and rain
break at the entrance.
Replace or repair the doggy doors to ensure that the dogs are protected from the wind and rain inside their shelters.
To be corrected by November 25,2016.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The large breed dogs are housed in outdoor kennels. These outdoor kennels have shelters that the licensee states
are 4 by 4 feet. These shelters are sufficient for two adult, large breed dogs. The majority of these kennels have 3
adult dogs and some have as many as 4.
Outdoor facilities for dogs must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each
outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a
normal manner, and to turn about freely.
Animals must be moved so that there are no more that 2 large breed dogs in each of the outdoor kennels that has a
4X4 shelter. Animal numbers may need to be reduced, or new kennels provided, so that no more than 2 large
breed dogs are housed in these outdoor kennels. It is imperative that this be done quickly as temperatures in
Michigan continue to drop.
To be corrected by November 25, 2016.
3.6(a)(2)(i)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The kennels for the large breed dogs are made of fence panels. These panels have been cut such that sometimes
long sharp points remain, especially around the kennel doors. The fence panels are attached together by twisted
metal wires. There are numerous sharp points in each of the large breed kennels, and the whelping kennels, either
from the cut ends of the fence panels or the twisted ends of the attachment wires, or both.
Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound and
have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs.
The fasteners must be removed and replaced, and the sharp ends reduced and smoothed, so that they do not pose
an injury threat to the dogs.
To be corrected by November 30, 2016.
3.6(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are two 4 month old Labradoodles being housed in a kennel in the whelping building. There is an area in
their shelter with exposed insulation.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the dogs from injury.
Cover this area of insulation so that the puppies cannot come in contact with the insulation and to ensure that the
puppies do not ingest the insulation.
To be corrected by November 25, 2016.
3.7(b)
COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
Two Female Huskies started fighting during the inspection. The licensee had to enter the enclosure and hit the
animals with a stick to break up the fight. There was blood on both dogs after the fight, but no wounds visible.
Licensee stated these dogs are sisters and have fought repeatedly. If these dogs remain together, the fighting may
escalate resulting in severe injury or even death.
Dogs that are housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible, with the following restrictions: Any dog
exhibiting a vicious or overly aggressive disposition must be housed separately.
These dogs are not compatible and they must be separated.Corrected prior to the exit.
3.10
WATERING.
There are numerous plastic water containers that have been severely chewed. The rim of the chewed containers
are sharp and jagged. There is also an old pan that is being used as a water receptacle that is rusty, dirty, and
dusty.
Water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart, and before
being used to water a different dog or social grouping of dogs.
Water receptacle that have been chewed or contain rust cannot be properly sanitized exposing the animals to
disease hazards. Chewed/rusty containers shall be discarded and replaced.
To be corrected by November 25, 2016.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Several of the outdoor shelters for the large breed dogs have a strong odor of ammonia. Waste and soiled bedding
from the outdoor shelters for the large breed dogs is piled on the ground next to the shelter.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under and around primary
enclosures as often as necessary. Elimination of an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste reduces
disease hazards and odors.
Remove feces and soiled bedding from the outdoor shelters daily. Clean the areas under and around the kennels
as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards and odors.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are mice feces in the area where the dewormers and nail trimmers used for dewclaw removal are stored.
There is an approximately 3' hole in the floor of the small breed kennel that the licensee states they use as a drain.
The small breed kennel and the whelping kennel have been connected by a breezeway. There is a gap in the floor,
showing the dirt below, between the breezeway and the whelping area. These two areas are large enough to allow
various pests into the kennel.
An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals
that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and
reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
Repair these areas so that they do not allow entrance of any pest into the kennel.

The inspection was conducted on November 17, 2016 with the licensee, Dr. Kerry McHenry, VMO and Carrie
Bongard, ACI. The exit was conducted on November 23, 2016 due to time constraints and scheduling conflicts.
The licensee refused to sign the report.
