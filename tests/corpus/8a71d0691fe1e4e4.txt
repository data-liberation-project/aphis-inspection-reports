One male brown rabbit has a dried material on the hair below the left eye and on the left side of his face. The side of
his jaw is swollen and his ribs can be felt . The rabbit was said to be in a fight with another rabbit about a month
ago. The material on the hair, swollen jaw and thin body condition may be the result of injuries from the fight . The
rabbits wounds were treated topically for a few days by the owner. The swollen jaw and thin body condition are an
indication that this rabbit maybe in pain and not eating well. The rabbit must be examined by a veterinarian to
determine proper treatment .
