ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*Review of the "Animal Notebook" during this inspection revealed a signature sheet signed by the attending
veterinarian on 9/12/14 documenting a visit by the vet. There was no copy of the actual written program of
veterinary care in the notebook. The owner was reached by phone and asked if the attending veterinarian had been
out to the facility since 9/12/14 and he stated that the vet had been out to the farm for the spring exhibit season. The
veterinary clinic was reached by phone and stated that the clinic records show that the most recent farm visit by the
veterinarian was the 9/12/14 visit.
*A sick black and white pig was noted during the 10/14/15 inspection. The veterinarian was not consulted about the
pig for a diagnosis and treatment plan.
Regular veterinary care to include preventative care and diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and injuries is
necessary for the health and well-being of the animals and to help prevent the spread of potential zoonotic
conditions. The facility must provide daily observation of all animals and must communicate directly in a timely
manner with the veterinarian to ensure that the veterinarian has accurate information on problems of animal health,
behavior and well-being. The facility shall ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure
the provision of adequate veterinary care. Correct from this day forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On the October 14, 2015 inspection one sick black and white racing pig was noted in an enclosure by itself. The pig
exhibited a slight whole body tremor, a wide based stance to the rear limbs and a stiff legged gait on the rear limbs.
In addition, the ridges of the spines were more prominent than on the other pigs. During today's inspection it was
noted that the pig is no longer at the facility. One facility staff person stated that the pig was returned to the person
from whom it was acquired. A second person stated that they thought the pig had died. No veterinary treatment
records were available for review. The owner was reached by phone and stated that a veterinarian had not been
consulted as the pig is a farm animal and that it was returned to the person from whom it was acquired. Attempts to
reach the person who supplied the pig were made and were unsuccessful. The inspection report dated 10/14/15stated that a veterinarian needed to be consulted to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan for the pig. This was
not done. Adequate veterinary care requires that the veterinarian be involved in decisions regarding all sick and
injured animals in order to ensure the use of appropriate methods to diagnose and treat all diseases and injuries.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Review of the "Animal Notebook" during this inspection revealed that:
1) The acquisition records for the fall 2014 exhibit animals are not complete.
Goats, rabbits and pigs are listed but information is incomplete. There was no number of goats or rabbits in the
shipment listed. The cow on exhibit was not noted on the record. The name and address were listed for the people
from whom the animals were acquired but there was no USDA number or drivers license number and state/vehicle
plate number and state recorded.
2) There are no disposition records for the fall 2014 exhibit animals.
3) There are no acquisition or disposition records for the 2015 exhibit animals.
Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with
certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. The facility shall make, keep and maintain records containing
all of the required acquisition and disposition information for all animals used on exhibit. Correct by Nov. 21, 2015.
