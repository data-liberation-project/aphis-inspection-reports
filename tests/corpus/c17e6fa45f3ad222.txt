Handling of animals.
During the auction, members of the public were observed walking into holding areas containing caged, potentially
dangerous, animals including skunks, raccoons, foxes, a kinkajou, and porcupines. These areas were behind secondary
fencing which have posted signs stating, “please keep hands out of pens,” “danger very aggressive animals,” and “please
keep gate closed.” Despite the signs, members of the public were observed inside the secondary fence, and many were
attempting to touch or pet the animals. At various points of the inspection, no facility employees were present to deter the
public from handling the animals. The inspectors notified staff members about the animal contact, however, a consistent
attendant was not present in these areas to observe the public during the duration of the auction. In the hoofstock barn,
members of the public were observed touching and petting two juvenile dromedary camels. The public were able to put
their hands into the enclosures and easily make contact with the camels. No facility employees were observed in this area
of the hoofstock barn to deter the public from interacting with the animals.
Failure to ensure appropriate distance and/or barriers, can allow for unintended interactions and lead to harm to the
animals or the public members. The facility is responsible for safe exhibition of the animals while on auction grounds,
including sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and general viewing public so as to assure the safety of
both animals and the public.


2.131(d)(2) Repeat

Handling of animals.
During the auction, members of the public were observed petting a dromedary camel and attempting to touch numerous
smaller mammals (fox, raccoon, porcupines). In these areas, the facility did not have readily identifiable employees on
hand during the public interactions with the animals. The facility has signage trying to deter people from touching the
animals, however, members of the public continued to contact the animals.
A lack of readily identifiable attendants to deter the public from contacting the animals can allow for unintended
interactions which could lead to harm to the animals or members of the public. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily,
identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact whether intended or not.

Primary enclosures used to transport live rabbits.
Many of the primary transport enclosures for the rabbits were not structurally sound and did not contain easily accessible
openings, projecting rims, or adequate handholds.
At least 10 of the rabbit enclosures were made of small, light weight laundry baskets with a wire covering over the top.
When these enclosures were stacked, they would buckle and break at different points. The inspection team observed two
rabbits escape from this type of enclosure during the auction. Approximately, 50% of the enclosures did not contain
openings to allow easy access in case of an emergency with the rabbit. 70% of the enclosures also did not have
projecting rims to ensure adequate ventilation is maintained or handholds to prevent tilting and contact with the animal.
Sharp, broken wires, were also observed in 3 of the rabbit enclosures.
A lack of appropriate openings, projecting rims, and handholds on primary transport enclosures can make it difficult to
remove the animal in the case of an emergency, allow for inadequate ventilation if the cages are stacked, and can cause
unintentional contact between the handler and the animal during transport. Inadequate structural strength of enclosures


and sharp protrusions can also allow for escape, entrapment, or cause injury to the animals. All primary transport
enclosures for rabbits must be structurally sound, contain openings that are easily accessible at all times for emergency
removal of live animals, contain projecting rims or other devices on the exterior walls to prevent obstruction of the
ventilation, and provide adequate handholds for lifting animals without tilting or risk of contact with the animal. Primary
enclosures must also be free from any protrusions that could be injurious to the live rabbits.

Handling.
After being consigned to the auction, several of the rabbit enclosures were stacked 3-4 enclosures high and tightly packed
together on large wagons. A few enclosures were found tilted to the point of almost falling, and eight were stacked with
heavy wooden enclosures on top of light weight, plastic enclosures which could potentially collapse under the weight.
While moving the rabbits from the check-in area to the holding area, a few rabbit enclosures were tilted to the point of
almost falling.
Inappropriate stacking of enclosures can allow for decreased ventilation and unstable structures which can impact rabbit
health and safety. Primary enclosures used to transport rabbits must not be needlessly tilted or stacked in a manner
which may result in their falling.
3.87(a)(3)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
The transport enclosures used to house two squirrel monkeys had openings that allowed the nonhuman primates to put
their arms outside the enclosures. The inspection team observed one squirrel monkey reach through the enclosure
openings to remove a sticker on the outside of the enclosure. The sticker was then pulled into the enclosure and pulled
apart by the animal.
Openings that allow for nonhuman primates to reach outside the enclosure can result in injury to the animal, public


observers, or other nearby animals if unintended contact is made. Nonhuman primates must be securely contained within
the enclosure and cannot put any part of its body outside the enclosure in a way that could injure the animal or
persons/animals nearby.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
Several of the primary transport enclosures for the mammals, including degus, skunks, and capybara, did not contain
easily accessible openings, projecting rims, or adequate handholds. Approximately 10% of these enclosures did not
contain openings or doors to allow easy access in case of an emergency with the live animal. 30% of the enclosures
holding these mammals also did not have projecting rims to ensure adequate ventilation is maintained or handholds to
prevent tilting and contact with the animal. A lack of appropriate openings, projecting rims, and handholds on primary
transport enclosures can make it difficult to remove the animal in the case of an emergency, allow for adequate ventilation
if the cages are stacked, and can cause unintentional contact between the handler and the animal during transport. All
primary transport enclosures for subpart F animals must contain openings that are easily accessible at all times for
emergency removal of live animals, contain projecting rims or other devices on the exterior walls to prevent obstruction of
the ventilation, and provide adequate handholds for lifting animals without tilting or risk of contact with the animal.
3.137(c)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The size of two of the enclosures was not sufficient for the animals to turn freely and make normal postural adjustments.
One wire and wood enclosure housing an adult African crested porcupine, was not large enough for the animal to turn
around freely. When the animal lay down, its head would touch one end of the enclosure with its quills protruded from the
other end. Another wire enclosure, housing a fox, was not large enough for the animal to make normal postural


adjustments. The animal did not appear to be able to stand and was not able to lie normally as its body touched all sides
of the enclosure.
Enclosures that are too small or created in a way that inhibit the natural movements of the animals can cause
unnecessary stress and discomfort.
Enclosures used to transport live animals shall be large enough to ensure that each animal has sufficient space to turn
about freely and to make normal postural adjustments.
