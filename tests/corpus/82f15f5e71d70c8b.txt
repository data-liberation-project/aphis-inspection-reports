Facilities, general.
Wooden posts and shelters have protruding nails present in several areas of the facility. There are also broken wire
points present on the fencing that are protruding into the enclosures in numerous areas. In addition, some of the metal
posts holding the wire fencing are leaning and unstable.
The roofing on the shelter for the wallaroo and one shelter for the kangaroos and wallabies will require repair or
replacement. The composite surfaces and underlying wooden surfaces are damaged and worn. The licensee plans to
replace the roofs of both shelters.
Maintenance issues must be identified and addressed in a timely manner to keep the facilities structurally sound and in
good repair, protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Facilities, general.
In the food storage room, several bags of pelleted feed are open and stored directly on the floor. Some pelleted feeds are
stored in metal cans, however, they do not have lids on them. There are also spilled pellets on the floor around the cans
and discarded feed bags in the room.
Any open supplies of food should be stored in a leak-proof container with a lid. Proper food storage conditions minimize
deterioration and assist with pest control.

3.127(d) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
During 2020, the licensee lost 8 adult wallabies and 2 wallaby joeys due to wildlife predation. The licensee believes the
predator was a bobcat(s), as he saw a bobcat in the facility with one of the wallabies. The perimeter fence did not serve
as an effective barrier to protect these animals.
The perimeter fence at the facility has numerous issues. The fencing in the back southwest corner is composed of wire
that is loose and unstable, and reaches several inches below the 6 foot requirement. Similarly, a fencing pole on the
western side of the facility is rotted at the base and leaning inward, and pulls the perimeter fence below 6 feet.
Vegetation is also pressing down on top of the perimeter fence in several areas of the facility, reducing the height below 6
feet. In addition, there is a portion of the perimeter fence on both the southern and northern sides of the facility that are
inaccessible due to heavy vegetation, and cannot be viewed. Finally, the northwestern corner of the enclosure adjacent
to the house does not have a perimeter fence present. This section extends for approx. 15 feet in length.
Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. A perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the
facility. The perimeter fence must be at least 6 feet in height.
The licensee must develop a reasonable plan with timelines to address the perimeter fence issues by September 17,
2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
