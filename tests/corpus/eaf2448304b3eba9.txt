ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230pm on
24-Feb-17.
There was no answer at the door, at which time I called the licensee and made contact by phone. There was no one
available to conduct an inspection on this date due to late work schedules until 9pm. I was given new days off for
the licensee and will be able to inspect another day with this new schedule.
