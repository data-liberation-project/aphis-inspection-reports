3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a build-up of dried mud on at least 10 dog shelters in the outdoor housing facility. Surfaces that are not
cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis may lead to an increase in disease transmission. All hard surfaces in
contact with the dogs must be spot-cleaned on a daily basis. Correct by 5 August 2015.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are three boxer dogs in an outdoor housing facility enclosure provided with three dog shelters. Two of these
dog shelters are not as tall as these dogs. Shelters that do not allow the dogs to stand in a normal manner may
cause discomfort to the dogs. All shelters must be of a size that allow the dogs to sit, stand, and lie in a normal
manner. Correct by 18 August 2015.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Weeds are grown-up around the outside perimeter of at least 5 of the outdoor housing facility enclosures. Many of
the weeds are at least 4-6 feet in height. Uncontrolled weeds can harbor pests and make cleaning difficult. All
weeds and grass must be controlled in the enclosures as well as the surrounding grounds to facilitate cleaning and
pest control. Correct by 18 August 2015.
