3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The current facility perimeter fence enclosing the wild/exotic hoof stock is only five feet in height. Outdoor facilities
for these regulated animals must be enclosed by a fence that is of sufficient height to keep unauthorized animals
and persons out and function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. Perimeter fences
less than six feet high must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
The perimeter fence should be adjusted to meet the six foot height requirement or the facility may apply for a
variance authorizing deviation from this requirement.
