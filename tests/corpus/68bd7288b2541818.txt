2.31(c)(7) CRITICAL
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An animal underwent a procedure which was performed with a significant deviation from the approved activities as
outlined in the protocol – the timeline was not followed, and what was meant to be 2 procedures separated by 4
weeks’ recovery was combined into a single procedure without the 4-week recovery time. As a result of this
deviation, the animal experienced a negative outcome and was humanely euthanized. The IACUC was not able to
review and approve this significant change prior to the procedure being performed. The purpose of the IACUC is to
ensure the humane treatment of animals in research. To correct this, the IACUC must be allowed to review and
either approve, require modifications, or withhold approval for proposed significant changes regarding the care and
use of animals in ongoing activities.
This item has been corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending and Clinical Veterinarians as well as the
Institutional Official, IACUC and compliance personnel.
