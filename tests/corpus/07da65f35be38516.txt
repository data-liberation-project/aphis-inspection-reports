Female Dachshund (microchip #0A01674805) has poor dental health. The majority of the surfaces of the right
upper cheek teeth are encased in a heavy, thick buildup of brown/tan colored tartar. The top half of the surface of
the upper, right canine tooth has a buildup of dark brown tartar. Nearly the entire surface of the upper left cheek
teeth are also coated in a buildup of brown/tan colored tartar and the top half of the upper left canine tooth has a
heavy, thick buildup of brown/grey colored tartar. The gums are moderately reddened.
Female Miniature Pinscher (microchip #0A01656747) has an abnormal appearance to both eyes. There is a
cloudy, blue color across the surface of both eyes and a small amount of crusty, yellow discharge is attached to the
hair around the upper and lower eyelids of the left eye. At the time of the inspection, the inspector observed that the
dog’s behavior may indicate that she is having trouble with her vision. This dog has not been evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian for the condition of her eyes.
Female German shepherd (microchip #0412507E71) has an open wound on the backside of the external ear. The
edges of the wound appear to have a dry, brown crust and the center of the wound appears red, raw, and moist.
Dark brown and red material is attached to the hair near the wound.
Male German shepherd (microchip #000002002689022) has an open wound along the top edge of the external left
ear. A thick clumps of dark brown colored material are attached to the edges of the wound and the center of the
wound is red, raw and moist. Dry dark brown and red material is attached to the hair near the wound.
The licensee stated that the ears of both German shepherds did not look like this the day before, but they are
currently being treated with Vetericyn for the ear wounds. There is no statement from the attending veterinarian
approving this treatment, how many times a day the animals should be treated and for how many days they should
receive the treatment.
Open wounds and poor dental and eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the animals and could lead to
further health issues.
The above listed dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the
inspector upon request.
A verbal correction date of end of business on June 23, 2017 was given at the time of the inspection.
A bottle of Vetericyn currently being used to treat two German shepherds has an expiration date of August 2013. A
bottle of Albon has an expiration date of April 2016 and a bottle of Pyrantel has an expiration date of May 2016.
Expired medical products may lose their effectiveness and the health of the animals could suffer.
The use of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be acceptable veterinary practice
and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The licensee must either dispose of the expired products or
clearly label them as expired and they are not to be used on the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all medical
products used for the dogs is current in order to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure, containing one German shepherd, the plastic vinyl covering the wall above the access door inside
the shelter has been excessively chewed and torn. The wood underneath the vinyl is exposed and has also been
chewed and damaged. The plastic access door has also been excessively chewed and scratched and dark colored
dirt and grime has penetrated into the damaged surface. Damaged surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized which could increase the risk of disease towards the dog.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be
replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace, repair, or alter the damaged wall and access door in a
manner that allows for cleaning and sanitizing of these surfaces. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain
in good repair at all times.
A verbal correction date of July 3, 2017 was given at the time of the inspection.
