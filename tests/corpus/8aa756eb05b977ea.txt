Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility representative was using an expired eye medication (Tacrolimus 0.02%, expiration date 4/11/20) on one adult
female California sea lion. Medications that are expired may no longer be safe or effective, and may no longer work to
treat or prevent the intended medical condition. Correct by April 21, 2021 by using medications that are not expired, under
the supervision of the attending veterinarian.

Space requirements.
The trailer used to house 2 adult female California sea lions at the fair at night and sometimes when the operator is off
site contains a dry resting area that fails to meet the minimum size required under the Animal Welfare Act. The flat metal
rectangular dry resting area in the trailer is 85 inches long by 93 inches in wide, giving the animals 7905 square inches
(54.89 square feet) of dry resting space. The average length of an adult female California sea lion is 5.7 feet. The
minimum dry resting area required for one adult female California sea lion is 5.7’ x 5.7’ = 32.49 square feet. Two adult
female California sea lions require 32.49 x 2 = 64.98 square feet of dry resting space in their primary enclosure, so the
trailer lacks 10.09 square feet of dry resting space.
Adequate dry resting space is important to allow animals to rest and make normal physical, postural, and social


adjustments when out of the water. Correct by April 30, 2021 by housing animals in primary enclosures that provide at
least the minimum amount of dry resting space for the animals within the enclosure as required by the Animal Welfare
Act.
3.104(d)(3)(i)

Space requirements.
The trailer used to house 2 adult female California sea lions at the fair at night and sometimes when the operator is off
site contains a pool that fails to provide the minimum surface area required under the Animal Welfare Act. The pool in the
trailer is rectangular and has a surface area of 93 inches by 96 inches, equal to 8928 square inches (62 square feet). Half
of the surface of the pool is under a metal shelf, and a facility representative stated that when animals were housed in the
trailer the pool water was filled up to about 6 inches below the bottom of the shelf. The pool surface area uncovered by
the shelf is 93 inches by 48 inches, equal to 4464 square inches (31 square feet). Two adult female California sea lions
require a pool with a surface area that is at least equal to the minimum size required for their dry resting area. This case,
the minimum surface area for the pool in the primary enclosure is 5.7’ x 5.7’ x 2 = 64.98 square feet.
Marine mammal pools must have adequate surface areas to allow animals to make normal physical, postural, and social
adjustments while entering, exiting, and swimming in the pools. Pool areas under a low overhang do not provide enough
space for sea lions to make normal physical, behavioral, and social adjustments. The current uncovered pool surface area
is 31 square feet; an additional 33.98 square feet is required to meet the minimum surface area required by the Animal
Welfare Act.
Correct by April 30, 2021 by housing animals in primary enclosures with a pool that provides at least the minimum amount
of surface area required by the Animal Welfare Act.

Space requirements.


The trailer used to house 2 adult female California sea lions at the fair at night and sometimes when the operator is off
site contains a pool that does not provide the minimum horizontal distance required under the Animal Welfare Act. The
pool in the trailer is rectangular and is 93 inches (7.75 feet) wide and 96 inches (8 feet) long. Female California sea lions
require a pool with a minimum horizontal distance of at least 8.55 feet (102.6 inches), calculated as 1.5 times average
adult body length of 5.7 feet. The pool in the trailer is 9.6 inches short in width and 6.6 inches short in length.
Pools in marine mammal enclosures must provide adequate distance (length) to allow animals to swim normally, turn
around, and make normal physical, behavioral, and social adjustments while in the water.
Correct by April 30, 2021 by housing animals in primary enclosures with a pool that provides at least the minimum
horizontal distance required by the Animal Welfare Act.
3.106(b)(3)

Water quality.
***The facility houses 2 adult female California sea lions in a trailer at night and sometimes during the day. The trailer
contains a pool that is emptied and filled with municipal tap water each day. The facility reports testing the pH and
chlorine levels of the municipal water upon arriving at a new location, but does not test the water pH on a daily basis.
***The facility tests water from the outdoors pools for coliforms on a weekly basis using a “BioPaddle” test kit, but was not
conducting the test according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The facility representative stated that he fills the vial with
water, inserts the test paddle, and places the kit in the incubator. The instructions from the manufacturer indicate that the
water should be poured out of the vial prior to placing the unit in the incubator. There was no thermometer in the incubator
and the facility representative had not verified the temperature within the incubator.
***The facility was using chlorine testing reagents that were past their “best by” date to test sea lion pool water.
Captive sea lions spent a lot of time in the water swimming, playing, performing, and cooling their bodies. Monitoring pool
water quality parameters correctly, and at at least the minimum required frequency, is important for identifying water


quality problems that could be harmful to the health and welfare of animals who use the pools.
Correct by April 21, 2021, by performing water quality testing correctly and by performing such testing at at least the
minimum required frequencies set forth in the Animal Welfare Act.
3.113(a)(8)

Primary enclosures used to transport marine mammals.
The travel trailer used to transport 2 adult female California sea lions has only one opening for ventilation to the outdoors,
a window on the top of the enclosure approximately 7 feet by 2 feet in size. The window is located 6 feet above the pool
and dry resting area where the animals are located during transport. The facility representative stated that this window
was always open during transport. There was an air conditioning unit located at the top of the enclosure, which the facility
representative stated was used during transport during warm weather. The door from the animal enclosure into the rest of
the trailer was made of a metal frame with rope netting, thus permitting air from the kitchen area of the trailer to enter the
animal enclosure, but not providing the enclosure with sustained fresh air from the outdoors.
Sea lions require an adequate supply of fresh air during transportation in order to breath, to stay cool, and to eliminate
odors or gasses/vapors. Animals without access to an adequate supply of fresh air may suffer from discomfort, stress,
overheating, and exposure to unpleasant or harmful odors or gasses.
Correct by April 30th, 2021 by transporting sea lions in enclosures that meet the minimum ventilation requirements set
forth in the Animal Welfare Act.
