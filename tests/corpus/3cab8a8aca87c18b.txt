2.126(a)(1) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(a) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 12:15 P.M. on
09/22/2014. The facility refused to allow APHIS inspectors to conduct the Animal Welfare Inspection. Refusal to
allow inspection is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
The licensee met this inspector outside of the front gate to the facility and informed me that the property will be sold
& she was planning on moving to a new facility in the near future. The licensee did not want an inspection of their
animals, premises, & records at this time. She informed me that she would like to voluntarily cancel her USDA
license now and will re-apply for a new USDA license when at the new location.
