2.4 REPEAT
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
The licensee stated that a recently-acquired male serval died suddenly, without previous symptoms, and that a
gross necropsy by the Attending Veterinarian (AV) revealed a mass in the animal's neck/throat. A review of records
at the office of the AV showed that the licensee had called for an appointment for the animal because he wasn't
eating well and the licensees were concerned about a dental problem . The records show that the licensee later
called and canceled the appointment, reporting that the animal had died. There is no veterinary record of a
necropsy on the animal to determine cause of death.
The licensee interfered with the inspection by giving false information regarding the animal.
Correct immediately by always providing truthful information in records and in answers to questions.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The acquisition/disposition records were incomplete. The female sloth, Daisy, had no source information listed; she
was said to have been donated by individuals in Richmond, VA. There was no ownership transfer paperwork
available. The licensee said it was taken from the shipping enclosure by the airline cargo personnel at SeaTac and
was not given to the licensee.
Maintaining accurate records is required of the licensee so that animals can be tracked to ensure legal and
appropriate transfer of ownership.
The licensee corrected the incomplete entry at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with one of the licensees at the time of inspection. An additional
exit briefing with additional information was conducted by telephone before delivering the inspection report.
An IES officer also accompanied the inspection.Additional Inspectors
