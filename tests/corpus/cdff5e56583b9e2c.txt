2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Written Program of Veterinary Care
The licensee has an attending veterinarian and a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). However, the written
PVC is incomplete and inaccurate. The PVC only mentions avian species and has no guidelines for primate species
at the facility. Programs of Veterinary Care Plans that are inaccurate or incomplete make it difficult to ensure that
proper veterinary care is being provided. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a
complete and accurate written program of veterinary care that reflects the practices at this facility as well as all
covered species at the facility. The written program of veterinary care will ensure that there is accurate
communication between the licensee and the attending veterinarian, and ensure that all routine care and preventive
care measures are done with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian.
