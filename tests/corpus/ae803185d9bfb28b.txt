ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
** I called the facility about ten minutes before I arrived. I arrived at the facility at approximately 11:30 am. I sat for
about 10 minutes and then drove to the owners residence next door. I knocked on the door and called letting them
know I was at the residence. I returned to the facility after ten minutes and waited until 12:00 pm. I then called the
owner a last time letting them know that this would be an attempted inspection and that I was leaving the premises.
I also prompted the owner to give me a call once they received my messages. A responsible adult was not available
to accompany the APHIS Official during the inspection process at 11:30 am on 12/9/2015. A responsible adult shall
be made available to accompany the APHIS official during the inspection process.
