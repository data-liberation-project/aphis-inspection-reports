care at the facility. The licensee shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements and must
schedule regular visits to the premises.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
None of the dogs at the facility have an official form of identification. Individual identification is required in order to
ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements. All live
dogs on the premises must be officially identified with a tag, tattoo or microchip and this identification information
must be made available to the inspector.
2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee did not have a record of dogs on hand (7005's) at the time of inspection. Complete and accurate
animal records must be kept in order to facilitate tracking and/or tracing of animals. Records must be made, kept
and maintained that fully and correctly disclose information concerning all animals purchased or otherwise acquired,
owned, held, leased, transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of and shall include any offspring born

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces.Four shelters have visible rust. The rust is pitting and flaking along the bottom portion of the shelter. In some places
the metal has completely eroded leaving holes and jagged edges along nearly the entire bottom edge of the shelter.
There are ten dogs in the affected enclosures. Rusted surfaces that are pitting and flaking cannot be cleaned or
sanitized properly. It can also affect the structural strength of the shelter. Interior surfaces and any surfaces that
come in contact with the dogs must be repaired or replaced so that it is free of excessive rust that prevents the
required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a build-up of feces and urine mixed in with dirt and gravel throughout all of the outdoor runs. All of the
feeders within all of the enclosures have a layer of dust and/or dirt on and within them. There are thirteen dogs in
the affected enclosures. Failure to properly clean within primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards for the
dogs. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once
every two weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and
other disease hazards. Floors made of dirt or similar material must be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficient
frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta. Contaminated material must be replaced
whenever this raking and spot-cleaning is not sufficient.
To be corrected by: October 22, 2014.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
None of the shelters have wind and rain breaks at the entrance.There are 13 dogs in the affected enclosures. Lack
of wind and rain breaks does not provide protection from the elements. Shelter must be provided with a wind break
and rain break at the entrance.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the outdoor enclosure containing 3 dogs there is an area along the bottom portion of a chain-link gate that has
broken and bent wires. The chain-link is starting to separate and unravel creating sharp points within the enclosure.
The wired panels that make up the wall of the enclosures in the outdoor runs are tied to steel posts using twisted
wire strands. Some of the ends of the twisted wire strands are sharp and protrude into the enclosure. In 3enclosures containing 6 dogs there are pieces of wire strands on the ground. The sharp wires present an injury
hazard to the animals. The licensee must ensure that all cages are constructed and maintained so they have no
sharp points or edges that can injure the animals.

WATERING.
In the outdoor housing facility, there are 5 enclosures containing a total of 13 dogs. All of the plastic water bowls in
the enclosures have severely chewed and worn surfaces. There is a build-up of dirt and grime on these surfaces. A
thick slimy green material is present on the inside surface of three of the water bowls affecting 8 dogs. The water in
those three receptacles has a slime-like appearance and contains an excessive amount of dirt and debris giving the
water a cloudy appearance. Failure to provide clean drinking water can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. All
water bowls must be kept clean and sanitized at least once every two weeks. Fresh water must be provided to the
dogs at least twice daily.
To be corrected by: 12:00 p.m. on October 9, 2014.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control.
An excessive number of flies are on and around all of the enclosures. One pen housing three dogs has an
excessive number of flies flying around and landing on the water receptacle. An excessive number of pests can lead
to disease hazards. An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs that are pests,
must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in animal areas.
