ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1410 on
28-Feb-18. I went to the licensee's house. A relative came out and informed me the licensee was not home and he
wouldn't be home anytime soon. I told him we would try again and I then left the property.
End of report.
