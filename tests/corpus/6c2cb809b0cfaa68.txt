3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Within the outdoor enclosures, there were at least five dogs that were observed with several fleas crawling
throughout the dogs’ fur. Some of the dogs were also observed scratching. According to the licensee and
documentation at the facility, products have been used over the last few months and as recently as 4-5 days ago to
control fleas at the facility. Despite using some products consistently for the past 3-4 months, the dogs still have live
fleas observed in their hair coat. Fleas increase the risk of diseases in the dogs and can cause discomfort to the
dogs. The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective program of pest control so as to promote the
health and well-being of the animals at all times. To be corrected by: October 13, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
