ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***I called the facility at 4:37 pm to let them know that I was on my way to conduct an inspection. I arrived at the
facility at 5:10 pm. Someone at the facility said that the partner was unavailable and they weren't sure when they
would be available. I let them know that I would wait for a while before I left the premises. I then called the partner
again letting him know I was at his facility and would try to wait a while before leaving the premises. I also explained
that If I couldn't get in contact with him to do the inspection that this visit would be considered an attempted
inspection. At 5:40 pm I informed the person on the premises to let the partner know I couldn't wait any longer and I
left the premises at 5:45 pm. A responsible adult was not available and shall be made available to accompany
APHIS officials during the inspection process.
