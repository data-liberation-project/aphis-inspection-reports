contamination.

Sanitation.
There are multiple wooden posts with rusted metal wire attached and with sharp points protruding outwards and sections
of older irrigation tubing in the sheep pasture. Sharp metal points and debris in enclosures can cause injury to the
animals. The facility must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Remove these hazards from
the sheep pasture.
