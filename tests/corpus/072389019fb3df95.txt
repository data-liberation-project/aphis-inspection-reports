ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:35 am on
06-Sep-17.
Spoke to Mrs. Cunningham at the facility. She was experiencing a family emergency. Mrs. Cunningham was not
opposed to inspection, but we agreed another time would be more reasonable due to today's circumstances.
