No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.

The exit interview could not be conducted with the licensee since the licensee is never present at the location where
his animals are housed and cared for. The on-site person(s) who is/are responsible for providing daily care for the
primates are now unwilling to sign for this inspection report as they have done so in the past.
This inspection report will be mailed by First Class Mail to the licensee.
