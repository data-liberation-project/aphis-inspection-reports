3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Three adult border collies are housed in an outdoor enclosure located within a loafing shed. The ground in the enclosure
is covered by a rubber flooring material which has a buildup of dirt, straw, feces and debris on its surface. The buildup of
debris and feces is concentrated around the base of the shelters and additional areas of dried, packed organic material
are compressed onto the surface of the rubber flooring. The exterior surfaces of the metal self-feeder are also coated in a
layer of brown dirt. The buildup of dirt, feces and debris could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

Primary enclosures and food and water receptacles must be sanitized once every two weeks and more often if necessary
to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards. The licensee must clean and
sanitize the rubber flooring and metal feeder and must ensure that all enclosure surfaces are maintained in a clean and
sanitized condition in order to support the health of the animals.

To be corrected by: a verbal correction date of 27-April-2022 was given at the time of the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
