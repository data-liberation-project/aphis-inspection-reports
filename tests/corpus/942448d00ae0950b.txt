Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:27-10:57 a.m. on
August 5, 2021.

I knocked on the door, called the number on file (which is no longer in service), waited for 30 minutes, and left a leave
behind flyer.
