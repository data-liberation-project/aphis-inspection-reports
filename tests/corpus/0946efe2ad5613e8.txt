2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
"Terry" (tiger) has a link type collar around his neck. The links are attached together by a metal padlock which
hangs from the collar. This padlock places unnecessary weight on the links & collar, as well as unnecessarydiscomfort to the animal due to the hitting of this dead weight against the neck. This design also increases the risk
of entrapment of the collar.
This collar can be attached by other means to minimize the weight and discomfort that now exists.
