3.125(a) Direct Repeat

Facilities, general.
The inspectors observed a juvenile raccoon that was entrapped in the wire panel of its enclosure. The animal has slid its
left foreleg through an opening in the panel and then angled the leg upward as it came into contact with the exterior water
line and could not withdraw the leg back into the enclosure. The licensee worked on cutting the wire apart for nearly one
minute and was able to free the raccoon's leg. A bloody laceration is located on the anterior surface of the foreleg. This
enclosure is constructed of material that allows the leg of the juvenile raccoon to pass through openings and has resulted
in an injury to the animal.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must ensure the enclosures are constructed of such material that
eliminates the risk of injury to the animals.

One enclosure, containing one skunk, has damaged wire flooring. The wire has broken resulting in several sharp points
and in a hole large enough for the skunk's foot to pass through. The licensee moved the skunk to a compliant enclosure
at the time of the inspection.


One nest box, accessed by at least four ferrets, has damaged wire flooring. The wire has broken resulting in sharp points
and in a hole large enough for a ferret's foot to pass through. The licensee provided the ferrets with a new compliant nest
box at the time of the inspection.

At least seven enclosures, containing an approximate total of seven skunks, have sharp points located along the bottom
of the nest box opening. The skunks could come into contact with the sharp points each time they enter and exit the nest
box. The licensee removed the sharp points at the time of the inspection.

Sharp points and holes in the flooring could cause injury to the animals.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must ensure the enclosures are free of sharp points and
maintained in good repair at all times in order to support the well-being of the animals.

Two enclosure, containing an approximate total of two ferrets, have a loose section of wire floor lying directly on top of the
original flooring. In one of the these enclosures the loose section of flooring is severely bowed upward in the corner of the
enclosure. The loose section of flooring in the other affected enclosure is bowing upward in front of the nest box opening
and the animals could potentially crawl out of the nest box and beneath the loose section. Loose, bent and/or damaged
flooring could cause injury to the animals.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the

animals from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must alter the bowed flooring in a manner that eliminates the
risk of injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure the flooring is maintained in good repair at all times in order to
support the well-being of the animals. The licensee corrected the non-compliant flooring at the time of the inspection.

One enclosure, containing one skunk, has a large gap between the nest box and the wire flooring. The gap is large
enough to allow the skunk's foot to pass through. One enclosure containing one ferret has one inch gaps between the
nest box and the wire panels of the enclosure. The gaps are large enough that a ferret could potential pass its leg or
head through. Gaps that are large enough to allow an animal to pass part of its body through could cause the animal to
become entrapped or injured.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must ensure the enclosures are maintained in good repair
and safe for the animals at all times in order to support their well-being. The licensee eliminated the gaps at the time of
the inspection.

Watering.
Many enclosures contain water bowls and receptacles in addition to the automatic waters. In at least 14 enclosures
containing 10 foxes, 6 skunks, and 9 racoons, those water receptacles were not clean and contained water mixed with
plant material, dead insects, food waste, and/or fecal material. Some receptacles had moss growing in it indicating they
had not been clean in some time.

Dirty water can contain bacteria and other contaminants that can make animals ill. The contaminated/stagnant water can

attract pests and become a breeding area for insects.

All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary or can be removed from the enclosures if not needed.

Sanitation.
At least seven nest boxes, accessed by a total of approximately nineteen skunks, contain heavily contaminated bedding
material. The hay placed in the nest boxes is severely saturated and caked together with wet feces. One nest box has fly
maggots found within the layers of contaminated bedding. The wood floors of several of these affected nest boxes have
become saturated and the wood is soft and beginning to rot away. Failure to remove waste and excreta from the
enclosures could cause the animals to become contaminated and could increase the risk of disease.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. The licensee must ensure that all nest boxes
are free of contaminated bedding material in order to support the health and well-being of the animals.

The licensee was able to move some of the animals to compliant enclosures at the time of the inspection.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
At least three enclosures containing at least 10 skunks had food on top of their wire enclosure that was heavily
contaminated with flies.


Flies carry bacteria that can contaminate food and can cause illness in animals.

A safe and effective program for control of flies and other insects shall be established and maintained.
