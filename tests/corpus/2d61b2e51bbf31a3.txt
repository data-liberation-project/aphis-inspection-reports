3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- There are several areas in the great ape escape portion of the park that need attention. In all of the day rooms
and in the indoor portion of the enclosures there is paint peeling from the walls. 3 of the 4 day rooms and 5 of the 9
interior primate enclosures have peeling paint areas on the concrete walls. In these areas, the coating is not in
contact with the concrete walls. These areas can not be readily cleaned and sanitized and could trap debris and
disease causing organisms which could affect the health of the non human primates. All surfaces must be
constructed in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized.

SANITATION.
- The surface of the off display holding area pools for the pinnipeds has paint that is chipped, peeling and
discolored. This is resulting in multiple areas where the coating is not in contact with the floor of the pools. These
areas could trap pathogens and lead to disease transmission. Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for marine
mammals must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Peeling and chipped paint can not be cleaned and sanitized and may harbor harmful bacteria. The pool surfaces
should be repaired or replaced to ensure the safety of the animals in the enclosures.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The bottom and side corner chain link fencing wire on the enclosure gate to the outdoor Grevy zebra's holding area
is curled up and has sharp points sticking out. The wires are sticking into the enclosed area and could result in an
injury to the enclosed animal. The wires should be repaired or replaced to prevent injury to the enclosed animal.

SANITATION.
- At the time of the inspection there were rodent droppings accumulating on the floor concentrated around the edges
and corners in the elephant food preparation area. Lack of an effective program that controls rodents can create
unsanitary conditions that lead to the potential spread of disease. Traps were present however, most were not set
or baited. An effective program of rodent control must be established and ensure all rodent droppings are removed
from the area for the health and well being of the elephants.
