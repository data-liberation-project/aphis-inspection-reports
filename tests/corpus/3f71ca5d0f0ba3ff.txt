2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female King Charles Cavalier had been bitten through an enclosure fence by another dog a few days
earlier, resulting in skin injuries and an injury to the left eye. The licensee had consulted her veterinarian about the
injuries and treatment. However, the medication being used for the eye (Optimmune) had expired in August, 2008.
The licensee stated that the skin injuries were improving, but the eye was not. Expired medications or vaccines can
lose their effectiveness and their ability to prevent or control disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure that all
medications and vaccines are within their expiration dates at all times. The licensee was instructed to consult her
veterinarian about the eye condition again since it was not improving.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There were 14 enclosures in the outdoor area, housing about 30 Boston terriers and King Charles Cavaliers, with
shelters that had an inadequate amount of bedding. The shelters contained straw, but not enough for the recent
temperatures, which had reached 33 degrees F the previous night and 24 degrees F the night before that.
Adequate bedding is necessary to protect the animals from the cold. The licensee must provide clean, dry bedding
whenever temperatures fall below 50 degrees F and must provide additional bedding whenever temperatures reach
35 degrees F.
TO BE CORRECTED BY THE END OF THE DAY. The licensee stated that she did have bedding on hand and
could put the bedding in the shelters by the end of the day.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
