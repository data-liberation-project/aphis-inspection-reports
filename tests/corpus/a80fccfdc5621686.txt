3.80(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
The sealant on the concrete floor of the non-human primate enclosures is starting to wear off in areas of each of the
enclosures. Areas of the floor where the sealant has worn off are starting to absorb liquids-they visually appear darker
and wetter than the areas where the sealant is still intact. These surfaces are no longer fully readily cleanable and
sanitizable which could lead to odors, contamination of feed biscuits/enrichment items dropped on the floor, and possible
disease hazards. The nonhuman primate enclosures must be maintained so that they enable all surfaces in contact with
the nonhuman primates be readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by Aug. 31, 2022.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Several areas of the nonhuman primate housing building are in need of cleaning and repair.
*One area of the plastic wall material has been damaged leading to exposure of the insulation underneath.
*The interior wall surface has a mild accumulation of dust.
*Some cobwebs are present on the interior surface of the large rolling doors and the wall/ceiling junction.
The housing building must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the nonhuman primates, to facilitate regular


husbandry practices and to reduce breeding and living areas for rodents, pests and vermin.
Keep the interior surfaces of the nonhuman primate housing building clean and in good repair. Correct by May 5, 2022.
