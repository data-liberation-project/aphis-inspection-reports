ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary care is dated for 2016 and does not list guinea pigs. Since the 2 guinea pigs noted in the
card board boxes are being shipped back to site #1 to be put to sleep there has been no communication with the
attending veterinarian. This was verified with a phone call to the AV who not notified of the sick and soon to be put
to sleep guinea pigs. The licensee must have and the PVC updated and contact the AV about all sick animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
2 live guinea pigs are being shipped in card board boxes. Cardboard boxes are not structurally sound enough to
withstand the normal rigors of transportation. There is not enough suffient air in these two card board boxes for the
animals to breathe normally. The licensee must provide proper adequate shipping containers with suffient air and be
made of materials that are strong enough for the rigors of transportation.
Corrected during the inspection3.36(a)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
There are 2 shipping containers with one guinea pig in each without the proper Live Animal Labels. They must be
clearly posted on top and on one or more sides and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright
position. Cargo shipping containers must have these labels and markings so the animals are not in danger of the
container being handled improperly. The licensee must have live animal labels on all shipments that contain USDA
covered species under the AWA.
