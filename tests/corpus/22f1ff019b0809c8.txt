INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol #46372 had a search for alternatives to painful procedures which yielded five results as indicated by the
Principle Investigator (PI). None of the results were found to have alternatives. A search yielding low numbers of
articles indicates a strong likelihood that the terms used were to restrictive. In this case the PI limited the search to
the species of animal he was working with and used qualifiers that would limit the usefulness of the search. The
principal investigator must consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain
or distress to the animals, and provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources, used to
determine that alternatives were not available. Correct From this point forward
An exit interview was conducted with facility Attending veterinarian and IACUC Chair.
