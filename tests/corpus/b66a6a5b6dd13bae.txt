There are an excessive number of fruit flies present in the back of the "reptile house". The majority of the flies are
located within an enclosed fruit box, however there are a large number of fruit flies in the area surrounding the fruit
box. Pest control devices are present in this area of the facility, but there are still an excessive number of flies flying
around and landing on the walls, fruit boxes and objects surrounding the boxes. Two ring tailed lemurs, one red
ruffed lemur and a vervet are housed in this area. The licensee confirmed these are fruit flies. The presence of
pests can lead to health hazards for the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of pests, including
flies, must be established and maintained.
