2.32(c)(3) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
There was an incident involving 6 New Zealand adult rabbits (4 females and 2 males) that died soon after being
anesthetized for a surgical procedure. The study protocol specified an allowable range of volume by weight of the
induction drugs, but the amount administered was above the upper limit of the range. In addition, the amount given
for all 6 rabbits were the same volume, rather than a volume adjusted by individual rabbit weight which was
specified in the protocol.
Deviations from a protocol can result in unanticipated pain or death. The facility must ensure proper use of
anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers for any species of animals used by the facility. It is the responsibility of the
research facility to provide continued training and instruction to all personnel with sufficient frequency to fulfill the
research facility’s responsibilities.
Corrections were made soon after the incident happened.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
