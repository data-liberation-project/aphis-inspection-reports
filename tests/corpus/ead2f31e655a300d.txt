3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were at least six occupied enclosures for the sheltered whelping building that contained greater than a day's
worth of feces. It appeared difficult for some of the dogs to maneuver around the fecal material in the outdoor
portion of the sheltered building; however, there were some areas of flooring that did not have fecal material and the
dogs could avoid it. According to the licensee, it had been two to three days since the outside of the enclosures had
been cleaned. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease hazards and the dogs becoming soiled.
The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact are spot-cleaned daily and
sanitized in accordance with Sec 3.11 (b) to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. To be
corrected by: October 30, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
