ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1825 on
17-Nov-16. I went to the licensee's house. The licensee was not home, but a relative was. He informed me that
the licensee was not home, but that I should contact her by phone as he did not know where she was at. I called
the licensee by phone and she informed me she was working and would not be able to come home for the
inspection. I informed her I would try again another time.
End of report.
