PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The primary enclosure for the rabbit is an enclosed area within a display wall. There are two ventilation fans to
move air for the animal. At time of this inspection there is a large amount of rabbit hair and dust around the
ventilation fans and hair was seen blowing out the exhaust areas. Keeping the ventilation system free of hair and
dust is important as fans could burn out and possibly cause a fire. Ventilation is very important for the health and
welfare of the animal housed in the enclosure. Cleaning of the enclosure needs to be more frequent and thorough
so that accumulations of hair and dust do not build up.
