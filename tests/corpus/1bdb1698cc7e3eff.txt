HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On October 10, 2019, approximately at 10:00 am, a male African Cheetah named "Diesel" unexpectedly bit/injured
a zoo keeper while performing routine cleaning of his primary enclosure. The affected zoo keeper immediately
called for assistance, two additional keepers in the area responded and using a recall from outside the enclosure,
the cheetah released the keeper allowing a safe exit from the enclosure. Even though the keepers used proper
established protocols, unnecessary behavioral stress to the animal must be avoided. After the incident, to prevent
similar occurrences, facility management proactively reviewed protocols to assess any needed changes and/or
improved safety aspects during routine enclosure cleaning.
All applicable protocols and safety aspects reviewed and updated by the time of this inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with four facility representatives.
