2.126(a)(1) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
At 9:07am on Wednesday, May 12, 2021, Animal Care inspectors attempted to conduct a routine inspection. The licensee
told the AC inspector that he would not allow entrance to the property for purposes of an inspection because, "the pens
are a mess, I haven't been able to hire help, and now is just not a good time." The inspector informed the licensee that
this would be considered a refusal and communicated the seriousness of this noncompliance. The inspector asked the
licensee a second time if he would allow the inspection and again the licensee refused inspection. Each dealer, exhibitor,
intermediate handler, or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to enter its place of business, examine
and copy records required to be kept by the Act and the regulations in this part, inspect and photograph the facilities,
property and animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act. The licensee shall
allow the inspectors to document, by the taking of photographs and other means, conditions and areas of noncompliance.
In addition, a responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.

To be corrected: immediately

No exit briefing was conducted due to the licensee's refusal of the inspection.
