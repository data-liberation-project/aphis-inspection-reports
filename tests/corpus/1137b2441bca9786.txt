ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**The wolf hybrid Dukon had and approximately 1/2 inch blackish, scabbed section on the tip of both ears. Several
flies were observed on the scabbed section and flying around his ears when he occasionally shook his head . It was
explained that fly ointment had been recommended by the attending veterinarian around three weeks ago, but the
animal is difficult to handle due to temperament issues, and therefore has not yet received treatment.
This can be evidence of fly strike, a condition which causes discomfort to animals and must be controlled through
appropriate veterinary care.
**The wolf hybrid Snow Princess was observed to stand and move with a somewhat hunched posture. There is also
evidence of moderate staining on her inner thighs and tail. She was last examined by the veterinarian three weeks
ago and is being brushed regularly as per recommendations to address staining and matting, however, irregular
posture or gait was not recorded.
Hunched posture can indicate discomfort or pain and must be evaluated by a veterinarian to diagnose any illness
and provide appropriate veterinary care to the animal.
