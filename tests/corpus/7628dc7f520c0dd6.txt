SANITATION.
Four of the six rabbit enclosures contain excessive amounts of feces. Additionally, one of the enclosures had
excessive rabbit fur on the cage wall. The smaller brown and white rabbit's enclosure contained a pile of feces
measuring approximately 3x3 inches in the corner. Feces can attract flies and serve as a reservoir for diseases that
affect animals.
Thoroughly clean and sanitize the rabbit enclosures and repeat often enough to prevent excessive build up.To be corrected: 9-11-15
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Approximately one foot of hay, straw, and feces are present on the ground of the goat pen. The goats are housed
in a pen comprised of wire panel. The height of the hay, straw, and feces can be visualized from outside of the pen
as the fence height has been shortened for the animals. Additionally, The top of the plastic water tub,
approximately one foot in height, is nearly level with the hay, straw, and feces. The excessive material could
potentially allow the animals to escape from their enclosure and/or contaminate their drinking water.
Remove the excess hay, straw, and feces from the pen and repeat often enough to prevent build up.
