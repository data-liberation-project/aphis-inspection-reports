SANITATION.
In the nursery areas, there was a build up of food and fecal material between the slats of the flooring in the animal
pens. There was also a significant amount of formed feces and many of the sows and piglets were noted to be
soiled. For the animals' comfort and health, cleaning needs to be more thorough to avoid build-up of old material,
and fresh feces neeed to be removed often enough to avoid soiling the animals. To be corrected by the next day
and then ongoing.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
