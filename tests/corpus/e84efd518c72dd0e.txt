FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On March 28, 2017, at 10:00 AM while shifting the black rhinos to their outdoor enclosure, the keeper on duty left a
gate leading to a secondary holding area unbolted. This allowed the male black rhino to then push the gate open
and walk out. A code 3 was called and work began on re securing the animal.
Standard operation of emergency procedures were followed, which involved veterinary staff, curators, and assigned
emergency response team members. After roughly three minutes, the rhino was able to be lured back into his
primary enclosure with food from the secondary containment area. The gate was then locked safely. The facility was
able to safely secure the gate and contain the rhino without the use of chemical restraint or shooting/dart
equipment.
A debriefing occurred following the incident determined the escape was due to keeper error. The keeper was
counseled on the incident immediately and proper disciplinary action was taken. The gate is not in need of repair,
however, it was modified to reduce the chance of another incident in the future. A restrictor will be installed to allow
limited opening of the gate as well as a stop to prevent it from swinging out.
Animals may be injured or harmed when they access areas that are not maintained for their daily use. Though the
rhino remained within secondary containment, had they gained outside access it could have resulted in serious
animal or human injury. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained to protect and contain the
animals.
