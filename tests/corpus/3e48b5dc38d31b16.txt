FEEDING.
The hay for twenty prairie dogs is being fed directly on the ground. The hay can be contaminated by excreta in the
pen and by the animals walking through the hay, which has been placed in different areas around the enclosure.
One of the pile of hay on the ground is saturated with water making it unfit for consumption.
Contamination of feed can lead to intestinal parasitism or overgrowth of microorganisms which pose a risk to the
health of these animals and feeding off the ground reduces this risk.
Food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health.
