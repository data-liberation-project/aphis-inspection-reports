ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file states that the attending veterinarian (AV) will visit the facility
at least annually. There are no records available that show the AV has been to the facility in the past year. Without
documentation we cannot be certain the program is being followed as written.A system should be in place to ensure
the AV visits the facility at least once a year to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a portion of the rock wall, which makes up the sides of the back off-exhibit area/den, where the wall did
not meet the ceiling. As a result, there were gaps present approximately 10 inches long X 3 inches wide. During the
inspection, the Camp Manager placed two lines of caution tape around the perimeter of the off-exhibit area/den as a
temporary fix until the permanent fencing could be in place. Outdoor housing facilities should be structurally sound
and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The bear enclosure has a covered top and is enclosed by an approximately 10 ft. perimeter fence. A section of the
perimeter fence, approximately 7.5 ft., is 6 ft. in height and does not meet our required requirement of 8 ft. In
addition, this portion of the perimeter fence is made up of vertical bars, approximately 4 inches apart. The space is
wide enough to allow unauthorized animals to enter the animal area. Outdoor bear enclosures must be enclosedby a perimeter fence at least 8 ft in height and consturcted in a manner that prevents the unauthorized entry of
animals and people.

SANITATION.
The concrete floor under the bear's enclosure has numerous rodent diggings/ burrowing under the edge of the slab.
Although the facility representative stated that the facility takes measures to reduce the rodent population, it does
not appear to be effective. The presence of rodents in animal areas may increase disease hazards. A safe and
effective program to control mammalian pets should be established and maintained to ensure the health and
well-being of the bears.
