CARE IN TRANSIT.
In speaking with the drivers I was informed that they do stop and check on the animals. However, there was no way
to verify that this was happening. Nor could it be verified that they were checking on the animals at least every 4
hours. To ensure that the temperature is within the acceptable range and that the animals are not in any physical
distress, a mechanism will need to be in place to ensure that all the animals are observed at least every 4 hours.
This inspection was conducted in a Park and Ride parking lot on RT 395 / exit 87.
An exit interview was conducted with representatives of the registrant.
