ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:15 am on
03/26/2015.
I arrived at the facility at 10:15 a.m. and knocked on the door. The owner of the facility answered the door and told
me that she was on her way out for an appointment. The owner also informed me that due to prior engagements
that she has today that she would not be able to do the inspection.
