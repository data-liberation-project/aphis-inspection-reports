RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records of acquisition, disposition, and animals on hand were not readily available for inspection today. The ability
to account for animals acquired, on hand, and removed is important for trace-back and trace-forward activities
during a disease outbreak. Per this section, dealers must keep appropriate records of acquisition and disposition
including but not limited to name and addresses and dates of animals contained on licensee's inventory. Correct by
January 1, 2018.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four holes were noted in the panel fencing of the primary enclosure containing 8 pigs and 1 goat. At least two
pieces of enclosure wire were noted to be protruding into the enclosure. The holes were large enough to entrap
smaller swine's and goat heads and the protruding wire could cause injury to any of the animals in the enclosure.
Per this section, the facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals
involved. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by January 1, 2018.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
An enclosure containing 8 pigs and 1 goat had only one 49" by 49" covered, three-sided shelter for all the animals
to use during inclement weather. Animals that cannot escape inclement weather become predisposed to illness
due to their inability to stay warm and dry. Per this section, natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local
climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them
protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals. Correct by January 1, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
