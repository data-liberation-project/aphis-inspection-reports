3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The following enclosures must be repaired to prevent injury to the animals.
1) The enclosure housing two goats has broken wires on the wire mesh fencing below the middle wood fence board
to the left of the gate. This section of fencing is detaching from the lower edge of the wood board, creating a small
gap. On the left side of the enclosure the wire mesh is separating from the lower edge of the middle wood fence
board, creating a small gap in the fence. The goats may be injured on the broken wires and/or get their head
caught in the fencing if they try to put their head through the gaps. The enclosure fence must be repaired or
replaced to protect the goats from injury.
2) The shelter for the red deer has several nails protruding down through the ceiling. The antlers of the deer may
rub against the points of the nails and be injured. The nails must be removed or the exposed nail points hammered
back against the ceiling to protect the deer from injury.
Correct both by May 27, 2014.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility partner.
