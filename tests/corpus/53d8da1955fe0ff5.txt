2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An intact adult male white sheep was lame on his right front limb at the walk. The ram was non-weight bearing on
the right front limb while standing. Facility representatives had not noticed that the ram was lame until the time of
the USDA inspection.
Lameness and non-weight bearing is an indication of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes
including both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to observe and properly communicate animal health issues to
the attending veterinarian in a timely manner can result in prolonged pain and suffering for the animal and
potentially worsen a current medical condition.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. The facility must conduct daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns
are found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
This ram must be examined by a veterinarian no later than 6:00PM on July 14, 2017.
A complete routine inspection was conducted on July 12, 2017. This report is limited to the direct noncompliant
items identified on that inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect noncompliant items will follow. The
inspection and the exit interview were conducted with the facility representative, APHIS intern, and APHIS inspector
on July 12, 2017.
