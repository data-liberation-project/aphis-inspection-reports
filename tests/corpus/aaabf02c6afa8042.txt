ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A clear pink solution was found to be in a container with commercial label for Bismuth. The solution did not appear
to be Bismuth and the facility veterinarian was not able to identify it. Multiple syringes containing a clear liquid were
found in the same room in a clear bag. Neither the syringes nor the bag were labeled . Lack of properly labeled
medications and other substances can lead to errors in the delivery of treatments to the animals. A system of proper
labeling must be in place.
These items were discarded at time of the inspection .
