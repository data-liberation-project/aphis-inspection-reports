3.1(d)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Currently, there is no lighting in the facility that allows for a proper inspection to be conducted without the use of a
flashlight. There are multiple windows, however on a cloudy day or when it is dark there is no way to see into the
primary enclosures to inspect the surfaces for cleaning or to conduct thorough animal observations without a
portable light source. The inspection and animals could only be properly observed using a flashlight.
It is important that a proper light source be provided throughout the facility that will illuminate all enclosures and
regulated animals in order to observe any health issues or dirt and grime buildup that can be hidden in the shadows
of dull lighting or minimal range portable light sources.
The licensee needs to put in a light source that will provide enough lighting to see into all of the kennels in order to
carry out all husbandry requirements, including cleaning, repairs and daily animal observations.
