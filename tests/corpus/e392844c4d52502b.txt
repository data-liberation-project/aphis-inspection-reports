ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:45 PM on
10-MAR-20.
Arrived at facility, called both numbers and left messages with phone number to call back prior to 5:15 PM. Talked
to facility representative who informed me that the contact person had left for the day. Discussed optimal hours and
attempted inspection.
