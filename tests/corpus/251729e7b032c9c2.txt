3.53(a)(5)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
This facility currently does not use nesting boxes for female rabbits with a litter less than a month old. A black/brown
and white mini Rex doe with 4 babies were observed inside of the enclosure without a nest box. The facility
representative stated that the 4 babies were only four days old. Nesting boxes are necessary in order to have a
safe place to give birth for the doe and to nurse her babies. A nesting box needs to be provided to all females with
a litter of less than a month old to ensure comfort and safety of the animals.
Correct from this day forward.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The mongoose and kinkajou enclosure has a foul odor around the enclosures. There is an excessive buildup of
feces in the corner of the mongoose enclosure and the kinkajou enclosure had excessive amount of urine soaked
newspaper in the enclosure. The facility representative stated that the enclosures were not cleaned during the
morning cleaning routine. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained, reduce disease hazards and odors. The cleaning schedule of these enclosures should be more
timely and effective to prevent the build-up of excreta, minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
Inspection was conducted by APHIS personnel with facility representative.
