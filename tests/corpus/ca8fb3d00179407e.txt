Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult tri-color (brindle, tan, and white) male guinea pig in enclosure # 47 housed with 8 other adult guinea pigs and 8
offspring was observed with multiple open wounds and hair loss with gaps in the top layer of skin with underlying tissue
exposed. The open wounds were dark red on the left side of the guinea pig that extended around to his rump. There were
no records present that this animal was observed with wounds prior to this inspection. This animal was not on any
treatment plan and there were no medications on hand to treat these injuries. Animal was removed from the group
enclosure and place in an isolation enclosure during the inspection. The current program of veterinarian does not address
open wounds. Licensee contacted a new veterinarian during the inspection on Wednesday and scheduled a veterinary
visit for the guinea pigs to be examined and to establish a new written program of veterinary care for the facility.

An adult black & white guinea pig in enclosure # 15 housed with 8 other adult guinea pigs was observed with hair loss on
the right side of the nose that was approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty with scabs present.

An adult brindle guinea pig in enclosure # 15 was observed with hair loss around the left eye approximately 1/2 of an inch
in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty.


An older weanling tri-color (brindle, tan, and white) male guinea pig in enclosure # 59 housed with 39 other weanlings was
observed with hair loss on the bridge of his nose approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty with
scabs present.

An older weanling tri-color (black, tan, and white) guinea pig in enclosures # 59 was observed with hair loss above the
nose approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty with scabs present.

There were no records to determine if these animals with hair loss, crusty skin, and/or with scabs were observed prior to
this inspection. There were no treatment records or medications present to treat these animals.

A failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can result in a delay of
care provided to animals and can prolong animal health problems. All animals must be observed daily to assess their
health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.

These 5 guinea pigs with veterinary conditions identified above require examination by a veterinarian to prevent
worsening of the conditions and unnecessary suffering. Additionally, the licensee must provide documentation of such
examination and treatment to APHIS officials upon request. Correct by November 1, 2021.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 509 adults, 82 weanlings, and 135
newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records for the number of adults, weanlings and

newborns present since the previous inspection report. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess
the health of the caviary by identifying guinea pig additions and losses by deaths or decrease in number of animals born
or animals kept for replacement, and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care and
use.

The facility must maintain complete records containing the required information which fully and correctly discloses the
guinea pigs held, owned, and disposed of including births and deaths. Correct by November 1, 2021.

Facilities, general.
There was a hole in the left wall of the animal room approximately 3 inches in diameter and another hole above a guinea
pig rack on the same wall. There was a hole approximately 3 inches in diameter below the sink in this room.

There were 4 young guinea pigs about weaning age and two adult guinea pigs loose on the floor of the animal room and
hiding under enclosures. Housing facilities need to protect the guinea pigs from injury, prevent pests and other animals
from entering, and contain the animals securely. Failure to do so can lead to injury or death from falls to the ground,
escape from the animal room, or become trapped outside the enclosure. Holes in walls and floor of the animal room can
allow pests such as insects and mice to enter the area and increase the risk of disease in the caviary. The facility must
be structurally sound and maintained in good repair, to protect the guinea pigs, and to restrict the entrance of other
animals such s pests. Correct by November 1, 2021.
3.28(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.

Enclosure # 58 housing approximately 42 older weanling guinea pigs and enclosure number 59 housing approximately 40
older weanling guinea pigs had bare wood on enclosures surfaces. At least two guinea pigs in enclosure # 59 had hair
loss with underlying skin was crusty with scabs.

All guinea pig enclosures must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and constructed of smooth material which
is substantially impervious to liquids and moisture. Bare wood on guinea pig enclosures can not be adequately cleaned or
properly sanitized, and allows the absorption of liquids and moisture. Bare wood can also increase disease risks and
health problems. Bare wood on enclosures must be sealed or replaced with an impervious surface. Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
There was a heavy buildup of brown scale and debris on the floors and sides of the guinea pig enclosures. All of the
enclosures had accumulations of excreta (feces), dirt, debris, wet and soiled bedding. The weekly cleaning process
(method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this accumulation both inside and on the outside surface of
enclosures and racks. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards and health problems.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, excreta, and soiled bedding.
In addition, enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures
are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta, dirt, debris, wet and dirty bedding.
Remains uncorrected.
3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.
Housekeeping. The floor contained accumulations of spilled feed, feces, bedding, dirt, and debris. There were
accumulations of dust, debris, and cobwebs on upper walls, ceiling, animal enclosures and racks. Animal facilities must

be kept clean to ensure good quality of air for the animals and to prevent unnecessary disease risks. Ineffective cleaning
exposes the animals to disease hazards and health problems. Correct by ensuring the premises are kept clean, including:
removing accumulations of dust, dirt, debris on floor, walls, ceiling, and enclosures; routinely dusting off and cleaning
surfaces; and maintaining a level of general cleanliness to support good animal husbandry and health. Remains
uncorrected.
3.32

Employees.
The facility does not appear to have sufficient help to adequately care for the number of guinea pigs housed and to keep
up with the general conditions of the facility. Licensee's young children, with some still attending school during the day,
are required to care, feed, and clean the guinea pig facility. Insufficient help allows cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping,
daily observations, record keeping, and veterinary care to fall behind, and these conditions can pose health risks to the
animals. There must be sufficient help or employees who are adequately trained to care for the guinea pigs in the facility
that is appropriate for good health and husbandry. Correct by November 5, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
