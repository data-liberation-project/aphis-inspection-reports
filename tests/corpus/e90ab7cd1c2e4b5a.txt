3.4(b)(3)

Outdoor housing facilities.
One (1) wolf-dog hybrid is housed in an outdoor enclosure which contains a wooden shelter structure. The wooden
shelter does not have a wind and rain break at the entrance. Shelters in outdoor housing facilities must be provided with
a wind and rain break at the entrance. Failure to provide a wind and rain break at the entrance does not ensure
protection from severe weather conditions, and could have a negative impact on health and well-being. The licensee
must add a wind and rain break to the entrance of the shelter to ensure protection from severe weather.
3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
One (1) wolf-dog hybrid is housed in an outdoor enclosure which contains a wooden shelter structure. The wooden
shelter does not contain any bedding material, and the licensee reported that they do not provide bedding material due to
concerns of adverse consequences related to potential ingestion of the bedding. Although ambient temperatures were in
the mid-50’s (°F) during the inspection, historical data for the licensee’s zip code (using National Weather Service data at
NOAA.gov) revealed low temperatures for the day of inspection at 33 °F (at 12:10 AM) and 35 °F (at 11:50 PM). Shelters
in outdoor housing facilities must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 °F (10 °C).
Additional clean, dry bedding material is required when the temperature is 35 °F (1.7 °C) or lower. Failure to provide


clean, dry bedding material does not ensure protection from severe weather conditions, and could have a negative impact
on health and well-being. The licensee must provide clean, dry, bedding material as required to ensure protection from
severe weather.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by April 18, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
