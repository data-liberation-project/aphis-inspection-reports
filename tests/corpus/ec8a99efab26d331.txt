ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility has four ring-tailed lemurs and has not developed or documented an environment enhancement plan to
promote the psychological well-being of these non human primates. The plan must be in accordance with currently
accepted professional standards and as directed by the attending veterinarian. The plan must address at a
minimum social grouping, environmental enrichment and special considerations (including infants/juveniles and
those that show signs of being in psychological distress through behavior or appearance). The facility must develop,
document and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement for the lemurs. Correct by 8/2/2018.
The facility was able to contact their veterinarian and get a plan in place at the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
