FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Opened supplies of food that are fed to the regulated animals are being stored in a barn in containers that are
uncovered. The facility representative said there is a known rodent problem and the inspector observed rodent
feces in this feed storage room.
The food within these opened containers is unprotected from vermin and other pests. Supplies of food must be
stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin
to ensure the health and well-being of all animals. A system of food storage which adequately protects the supplies
of food for all animals must be in place.

with numerous leaves floating in the liquid.
***There was a buildup of slimy, brown debris on the interior surface of the water receptacle in the enclosure
containing one adult goat and her two kids. There was also debris floating on the surface of the water.
Animals must be provided with clean, potable water to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain
adequate hydration. Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. They should be
cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
