3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the trailer with sheltered housing at the back of the property there were eight enclosures housing twenty one dogs
that had a brown greasy residue on the solid walls of the enclosures. The construction of the enclosures interferes
with the ability to effectively clean the solid walls of the enclosure. There are no exterior access points to the
enclosures so all cleaning and sanitizing has to be done from the below the enclosures and through the wire mesh
floors.
The build-up of dirt, feces, and debris can harbor diseases. The licensee must spot-clean all used primary
enclosures, and food and water bowls daily and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee and ACI Bartels.
