2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Male Maltese "Micky Boy" (microchip #933000320456813) was examined and found to have dark brown tartar buildup
covering the entire surface on both the left and right lower cheek teeth. The upper canine teeth had a buildup of dark
colored tartar along the gum line and extending half way down the teeth. Several of the lower cheek teeth on both sides
were loose and moved easily when touched by the inspector. The gums under these teeth are receding and inflamed and
bled during the examination.

Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. This dog must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and
treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that
all dogs receive adequate veterinary care.
