3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
*** A documented exercise plan was not available for review at the time of the inspection. Although the dogs are
housed in enclosures that provide the required space for exercise a plan still needs to be developed and
documented. A poodle identified #073554298 was observed spinning in circles throughout the inspection process
which is an indication of stress or boredom. When developing an exercise plan, the facility should consider
providing exercise through play or other similar activities.
