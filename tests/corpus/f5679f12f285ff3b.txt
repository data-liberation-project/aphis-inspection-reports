3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is still a heavy buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the floors and sides of enclosures. At least 15
enclosures (enclosures 1 through 16 except # 14) housing a total of 151 adult guinea pigs and their offspring had
wet bedding consolidated into a moist pad on the floor by the automatic water valves. There was water leaking on
the floor in front of enclosures 11 and 12. The accumulation of debris, feces, and wet bedding exposes the guinea
pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Correct by ensuring that primary enclosures are clean
and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta, wet bedding, and debris. Additionally, ensure
that the primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks.
Remains uncorrected.
