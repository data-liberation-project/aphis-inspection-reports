2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**The licensee reported to the inspector that he euthanized the animals when unable to treat them according to
SOPs worked out with his attending veterinarian, or if adult animals are to be culled from the breeding program.
This is normally done by the licensee via cervical dislocation in awake animals. It is written in the Program of
Veterinary Care that the licensee may euthanize the animals himself. This is done without consulting the attending
veterinarian for individual animals. Adult chinchillas at this facility weigh around 20-30 oz.
Cervical dislocation, when used alone, is not an approved method of humane euthanasia for this species and size
of animals. Generally, it is only recommended for mice, rats weighing <200 g and immature rabbits. Using an
inappropriate method to euthanize animals may cause the animal additional distress or discomfort.
The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian to determine an appropriate method to euthanize these
animals that meets current standards of veterinary care.

WATERING.
**About 50% of the water sippers in cages housing chinchillas had a thick coating of fine dust and hair adhered to
the sipper. Excessive dust, dirt, or organic materials on the sippers may cause illness in animals by harboring
pathogens the animals may ingest or discouraging the animals from drinking. All water receptacles, including
sippers attached to water lines, shall be kept clean and sanitary.

SANITATION.
**There was a large amount of chinchilla hair sticking to the wire mesh of unused cages within the chinchilla
housing area. These cages were adjacent, or occasionally in between cages housing animals.
Large amounts of hair or other organic materials can harbor pathogens, and accumulate dust or other irritants that
may contribute to illness or discomfort of the animals. Premises shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals
from injury and to facilitate husbandry.
