2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual reports generated by the IACUC and sent to the Institutional Official (IO) do not contain all of the
required information. Reports sent in November 2015 and June 2015 have been signed by the IACUC chair only,
and have not been signed by a majority of the IACUC members. No minority view is mentioned. Findings from the
facility inspection are mentioned, but significant from minor deficiencies are not distinguished, nor is a plan for
correction with dates specified. Findings from the program review are not included. Without clear and concise
communication between the IACUC and the IO in the form of semi-annual reports, animal use and facility findings
may go unnoticed and/or uncorrected resulting in decreased animal welfare. The IACUC must compile and submit
reports to the IO at least once every six months that contain all of the required information.

2.31(c)(6)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The animal use teaching protocol has expired. The date of expiration is April 30, 2015. The IACUC meeting
minutes show aspects of animal use have been reviewed, such as sedation protocols for dogs and cats, but a
complete IACUC review of the teaching protocol has not been conducted since October 2014. IACUC review of
animal use assures optimal animal welfare. The IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications in (to
secure approval), or withhold approval of those components of proposed activities related to the care and use of
animals, as required. No regulated animal may be used in a regulated activity without first securing IACUC review
and approval of the proposed use.
