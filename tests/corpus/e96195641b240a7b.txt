2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The licensees moved to a new location and failed to notify APHIS Animal Care of the change in address. Upon arriving at
the facility, the inspector was notified by the new property owner that the licensees had moved several months ago.
Failure to notify Animal Care of a change in location can make it difficult to verify regulated activities and ensure the
health and wellbeing of regulated animals.
A licensee shall notify Animal Care no fewer than 90 days before any change in the name, address, management,
substantial control or ownership of his business or operation, locations, activities, and number or type of animals.
Correct by: February 6, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
No regulated animals present and no regulated activity at this time.
