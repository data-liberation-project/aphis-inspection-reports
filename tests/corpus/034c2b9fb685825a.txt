2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 09:45 on
15-JUN-17.
There was no answer at the door of the residence upon arrival and no one entered the driveway during the next 30
minutes. The licensee could not be reached by telephone at the number provided to the USDA because the
voicemail recording stated the mailbox was full.
