ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Several dogs were matted and in need of grooming. Once the fur becomes matted, it pulls and separates from
the skin causing potential skin irritations and exposes the animal to the elements. These dogs need to be groomed
on a routine basis to prevent matted fur for their comfort and well being. These dogs included a Poodle
#7E10084657, Shitzu # 7E10084649 and a Pekingese #7E10084668.
*** There were a few expired drugs in the fridge and cabinet stored with drugs that are currently in date and use.
These included Pyrantel lot # 0650046 expired 09/2016 and Fish Flex lot # 12310 expired 08/2015. Expired drugs
need to be discarded in a timely manner so they are not accidentally used in the kennel. In addition a few
medications have been put into smaller bottles but their label information was not transferred. When medications
are put into containers different from their original one, pertinent information such as the drug, dosage and
expiration should also be labeled. This needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.

*** Several sections of the wood frame for the enclosures have been scratched or chewed to the point they are no
longer impervious to moisture. Any surfaces that come in contact with the dogs must be impervious to moisture,
therefore this wood frame needs to be cleaned and re sealed to facilitate cleaning of the kennel.
