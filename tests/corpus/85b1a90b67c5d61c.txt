2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is incomplete. Sections 3 and 4 of APHIS form 7002 have not
been completely filled out. The PVC is a written agreement between the exhibitor and the veterinarian establishing
standards of care for the animals. Failure to have a complete PVC could jeopardize the health and well being of the
animals. The facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals at the facility.
