2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The female skunk has a large area of hair loss over her back and rump encompassing approximately 30 percent of
the animal's body. The exposed skin was pink with areas of black pigmentation, but there were no signs of active
scratching or inflammation. In addition to the hair loss, the skunk had a rounded appearance to its body which is
indicative of a high body condition. The licensee stated that she had noticed the hair loss and contacted the
Attending Veterinarian (AV) about ten days prior to the inspection. The licensee also said that the skunk was not
being treated for the hair loss. When the AV was contacted by the inspector, he stated that he had not spoken to
the licensee prior to the inspection.
Diseases and injuries of the skin can be painful, irritating, or can indicate other disease processes in an animal.
Additionally, a high body condition in an animal can affect numerous body systems and potentially worsen existing
conditions. Failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can
result in pain to the animal and potentially worsening of the condition.
The licensee must implement and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The skunk must be evaluated by a Licensed
Veterinarian for further diagnosis and treatment of its hair loss. Additionally, the licensee must seek guidance from
the AV regarding this animal's body condition.
Before the exit briefing, the licensee scheduled an appointment for the skunk to be examined by the AV on
02/07/2020.
