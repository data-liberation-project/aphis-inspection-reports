RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee's Record of Acquisition of Dogs on Hand (form 7005) is incomplete for a good portion of the dogs he
has acquired since the last inspection. In the "Acquired Form" section (box I), the licensee has only documented
the first name of who he acquired the animals from. No other required information is provided. Not providing
complete and accurate information does not allow for proper tracing of the animals by an APHIS official. The 7005
form must be updated to include all required information. Correct immediately.
3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At least one primary enclosure was not large enough for the puppies it contained. The enclosure measured 48
inches by 48.25 inches for a total space of 2,316 square inches. The enclosure contained 8 puppies. I measured
two puppies and they both measured 13.5 inches in length. All the puppies appeared to look to be about the same
size. The 8 puppies together are required to have 3,042 square inches in space. The enclosure is short by 726
square inches. Cage space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their
enclosures. It also minimizes the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread
of disease. The licensee must ensure that all cages containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet
the minimum floor space requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that cage. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
