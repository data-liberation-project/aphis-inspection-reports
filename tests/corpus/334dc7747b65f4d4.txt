3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- There were rodent droppings and urine accumulating on the floor and on the bags of unopened dog food in the
front section of the pig barn-type building housing 123 adult dogs. The bags of unopened dog food also had holes in
them from the rodent activity. The licensee stated that the stack of unopened bags of dog food weren't being fed to
the dogs. The licensee had another brand of dog food near the unopened stack that was being fed to the dogs.
There was rodent poison located in several areas and several rodent traps around the outside and inside the
building as well. The licensee must establish a more effective program of rodent control and ensure all of the
unused bags of dog food with rodent droppings, rodent holes, and urine on them are removed from the kennel area.
It can lead to unsanitary conditions and the potential for transmission of disease from rodents to dogs. The licensee
must ensure all areas of the facility are kept clean to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in animal areas at all times.
