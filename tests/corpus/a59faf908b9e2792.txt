PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
This dealer has knowingly purchased from at least three individuals that require to be licensed under the Animal
Welfare Act. On 11/19/2015, APHIS officials collected all records from this facility to perform a records review and
inspection. During a review of the exemption certificates provided by the Licensee, it is apparent that 3 individuals
falsely signed exemption certificates. Based upon the records, these individuals have more than 4 breeding female
on their premise and require a current, valid and unsuspended license to sell puppies to the Licensee.
The first individual signed an exemption form 8 times from 3/9/2015-11/9/2015. The individual sold a total number
of 10 litters to the Licensee during this time; 7 of these litters all born within a 6 month period. The litter breeds and
date of birth are as follows: 2-husky puppies whelped 1/12, 2-huskey puppies whelped 1/13, 9-huskey puppies
whelped 1/19, 6-lab/australian shepherd cross puppies whelped 4/18, 5-lab/german shepherd cross puppies
whelped 4/18, 4-huskey puppies whelped 7/18, 6-husky puppies whelped 7/27, 1-huskey puppy whelped on 7/27
(this puppy does not have an assigned number on the certificate that correlates with the previous litter with the
same whelp date indicating it is from a separate litter), 6-huskey puppies whelped 9/14 and 10 Beagle/Bulldog cross
puppies with an unrecorded/illegible birthdate)
The second individual signed an exemption form 5 times from 2/23/2015-10/12/2015. The individual sold a total of 7
litters to the Licensee during this time; all of the litters sold were born within an 8 month period. The litter breeds and
date of birth are as follows: 5-huskey puppies whelped 12/28/2014, 2-beagle/bulldog cross puppies whelped
12/28/2014, 3-huskey puppies whelped 3/29/2015, 4-huskey puppies whelped 5/9, 3-huskey/beagle cross puppies
whelped on 5/9, 4-huskey puppies whelped 6/3 and 6-huskey puppies whelped 8/8)
The third individual signed an exemption form 6 times from 3/2/2015- an unknown date in September of 2015. The
sold date is missing on the exemption form for this sale. The individual sold a total of 7 litters to the Licensee during
this time; all of these litters sold were born within a 6 month period. The litter breeds and date of birth are as
follows: 5-yorkie/bichon cross puppies whelped 1/3, 4-yorkie/bichon cross puppies whelped 1/3, 1-yorkie/bichon
cross puppies whelped 1/13 (this puppy does not have an assigned number on the certificate that correlates with
the previous litter with the same whelp date indicating it is from a separate litter), 4-yorkie/bichon cross puppies
whelped 3/2, 2-yorkie bichon cross puppies whelped 5/18, 7-yorkie/bichon cross puppies whelped 7/1 and 3-labpuppies whelped 7/12).
Through the Licensee'(cid:25)s own record keeping, APHIS officials were able to establish that more litters were
purchased from each individual than 4 females would be able to birth during these periods. Based upon the puppies
dates of birth, amount of litters birthed within a short periods of time and normal gestation periods for dogs, it is
obvious that all three of these facilities have more than 4 breeding females on their premise. The records obtained
from the Licensee clearly establishes that they knowingly acquired puppies from unlicensed sources that clearly
require a USDA license but do not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license, which makes it impossible for
APHIS to regulate those animals and undermines a working relationship between the licensee and APHIS officials.
This working relationship is essential in ensuring the wellbeing of the animals under the Animal Welfare Act.
When APHIS Officials informed the Licensee of their findings, the Licensee stated that they had a changeover of
office personnel and that the employee that left was very good at keeping track of the amount of litters purchased
from each unlicensed breeder. The Licensee stated that they will be configuring their system to allow them to more
accurately identify how many litters they have purchased from unlicensed sources and be able to more closely
monitor the time frame for which they are purchasing them. The Licensee must not acquire puppies from any
unlicensed sources that require a current, valid and unsuspended license unless they are truly exempt from USDA
regulations and oversight. Correct from this time forward.
This was a records review only.
All records for review were collected on 11/19/2015.
Records were reviewed between 11/19/2015-1/21/2016.

Exit interview conducted with facility representative and Animal Care Inspector Shannon Sebera on 1/21/2016.
