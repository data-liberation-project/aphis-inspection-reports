3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the last sheltered housing building there are at least five enclosures, containing a total of six dogs; that have a
buildup of thick, dark colored dirt and grime on the access doors. The plastic frame around one access door has
been excessively chewed and shredded by the dogs and dirt and grime has penetrated into these damaged areas.
The licensee stated that the access doors were cleaned the previous weekend. The buildup of dirt and grime could
increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two weeks and more often if necessary to prevent
the accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The licensee must clean and
sanitize the access doors as often as necessary in order to eliminate the buildup of dirt and grime and to promote
the health and well-being of the dogs.
