INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
At the time of inspection, upon reviewing animal use logs, it was discovered that three animals that underwent xray
procedures as part of a teaching protocol, had more that the number of xrays that were specified in the teaching
protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The protocol specifies that no animal shall have more than ten xrays taken, yet the record showed that on 7/1/15
one dog had 18 xrays taken, and on 7/2/15 one dog had 18 xrays taken, and another had 23 xrays taken.
Significant changes to the protocol cannot be carried out unless approved by the IACUC. The IACUC is responsible
for reviewing all components of proposed animal use, and ensuring that the animals are treated in the most humane
manner possible, that protects their well-being. Unapproved changes to protocol specifications, such as excessive
xrays, could be detrimental to the animals.
To be corrected from this time forward.
2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
At the time of inspection it was discovered that on 12/4/14 a dog was given Ketamine, an anesthetic drug, and the
vial of Ketamine used had an expiration date of November, 2014 (vial # 5 in drug log).
Additionally, the anesthesia machines at the facility were all overdue for service - with "next service due" dates
12/14, 9/13, and 5/15.
The facility should ensure that appropriate methods are employed when administering anesthesia, and this includes
ensuring that drugs are not expired, and that anesthesia machines are maintained in optimal condition. Failure tomaintain such standards could result in adverse effects for animals undergoing procedures at the facility. Steps
should be taken to remedy these problems and ensure that they do not recur.
Use of expired drugs to be corrected immediately, and service on anesthesia machines to be completed by
10/20/15.
An exit interview was conducted with the Program Director (9/17/15) and the IACUC representatives (9/21/15).
