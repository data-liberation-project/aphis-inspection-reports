3.3(e)(1)(iii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The inside gate in the first enclosure has an area of chewed and scratched wood where the varnish has been worn away
and the surface is no longer imperious to moisture. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be properly
cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be impervious to moisture.
3.13(b)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The medical records do not include all the required information. Identifying the dogs only with their names makes it
difficult to determine which dog the medical record is in reference to. Medical records must include the identity of the dog
by official id number as well as the breed, sex and age of the animal.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
