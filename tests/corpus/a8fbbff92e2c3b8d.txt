2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The written program of veterinary care and a list of animals on hand were not available at time of inspection. Without
these documents we cannot verify the facility maintains records to track the acquisition and disposition of animals and that
a program of veterinary care has been established between the facility and a qualified veterinarian. Each exhibitor shall
during business hours, allow APHIS officials to examine records required to be kept by the Act and the regulations in this
part.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by May 1, 2022, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply.
Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
