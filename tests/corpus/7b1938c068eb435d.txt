Facilities, general.
On July 17th, 2020 an adult female red river hog ("Pierce" #201300) was missing from her primary enclosure. Pierce had
been housed in the exhibit's indoor enclosure (night quarters) with 3 other adult female red river hogs while the outdoor
area of the enclosure was undergoing repairs. Pierce was missing for 4 days and was recovered on zoo grounds within
the perimeter fence on July 22nd, 2020.
Animals who escape from primary enclosures may become lost, injured, or killed, and may suffer from hunger, thirst, and
exposure to the elements.
At the time of this inspection, two female red river hogs were housed in the enclosure that Pierce had escaped from.
Correct by securing the enclosure to prevent any subsequent animal escape. Correct by December 14th, 2020.

Space requirements.
A herd of adult red river hogs have been housed in indoor enclosures (off exhibit night quarters) for the past 7 months,
since June 2020. These night quarters were meant to be used for only housing the animals during the night when they
would be primarily sleeping. In June 2020, the herd consisted of 5 females and 6 males, who were segregated by sex and
housed in two separate indoor night quarters.


*The 5 adult females were housed in a cement-floored indoor enclosure which was approximately 14 feet long and 8 feet
wide.
*One female passed away due to natural causes on June 22nd, 2020, decreasing the number of animals in the enclosure
to 4 adult females.
*A second female ("Pierce" #201300) escaped from the enclosure on July 17th and upon returning to the enclosure on
July 22nd, she was attacked by her herd mates resulting in severe bite wounds to her ears, legs, and abdomen, including
a bite wound on the left front leg that resulted in non-weight bearing lameness. Injuries were managed by the attending
veterinarian. Pierce was moved to the veterinary clinic and temporarily to other night quarters, but was not moved back to
live with the other female hogs. Pierce's left front leg was diagnosed and treated by the attending veterinarian but due to
severe ligament damage the leg did not regain normal function. At the time of the inspection, Pierce was housed in the
veterinary clinic and was observed to be quiet and alert, laying down, and moving the left front leg gingerly. The animal's
prognosis is currently under evaluation by the attending veterinarian.
*A third female ("Ruby") was attacked by her herd mates in the indoor enclosure (night quarters) on July 30th, 2020 which
resulted in superficial injuries to Ruby's legs and ears. She was removed from the enclosure and housed at the veterinary
clinic, where she remains. At the time of inspection, 2 adult female red river hogs remain in the indoor enclosures and 2
are at the veterinary clinic for management and treatment of injuries.
*6 adult males were housed in an indoor enclosure approximately 12 feet by 24 feet in size, with a cement floor.
*An adult male red river hog ("Wesley, #201203) was observed to have a laceration on the left side of his neck/shoulder
on August 31st, which was managed by the attending veterinarian. Wesley was observed to have a new deep laceration
on the left side of his neck/shoulder on October 16th, which was managed by the attending veterinarian. Both wounds
were thought to arise from fighting with herd mates.


*A second male red river hog ("Bread" #201297) was observed to be acutely unwilling or unable to stand on October 21st
2020, and it was thought that this injury was a result of fighting with herd mates. Bread received treatment from the
attending veterinarian and recovered.
At some point, the male's indoor enclosure was divided into two spaces, and the males were separated into two groups of
three, each living in a space that is approximately 12 feet by 12 feet in size.
Zoo personnel stated that the red river hogs needed more space than they had in their indoor enclosure (night quarters),
but repairs to the outdoor area of the enclosure had been delayed and a timeframe was not yet known for when the
repairs would be completed. Zoo personnel stated that the animals had been confined to the indoor enclosures too long.
Zoo personnel stated that the animals did not fight when they had adequate space and access to the outdoors. The
attending veterinarian agreed that the red river hogs needed better housing and more space. The current space for all 10
red river hogs is inadequate and has not allowed for normal social adjustments as evident by the multiple incidents of in-
group fighting in an established herd. Additionally, all 10 red river hogs are currently overweight or obese, which may be
the result of prolonged confinement with inadequate space for movement and exercise.
Groups of animals housed without enough space to make normal social and behavioral adjustments can suffer from
stress, injuries, obesity, and arthritis. Inadequate freedom of movement impairs an animal's ability to maintain health and
well being.
Implement temporary correction by December 13th, 2020 by providing sufficient space to allow each animal to make
normal postural, behavioral, and social adjustments. Implement permanent correction by January 1st, 2021 by providing
sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural, behavioral, and social adjustments.

Sanitation.


Rodent feces was present on the floor in the bulk food storage area adjacent to the Zoo kitchen. In the walk-in freezer,
which was not operational, one bag of Mazuri animal feed had a 0.5 inch by 2 inch hole in the side and there was a 1
inch by 1 inch clump of brown rodent fecal pellets stuck to the feed bag next to the hole. Two other bags of feed in the
freezer had 1-2 inch holes in them. A large amount of rodent feces was present on the floor in an area under and around
two metal shelving units that contained enrichment items. Rodent bait boxes were located throughout the bulk food
storage area. An employee stated that the bait boxes were checked by employees every 2-3 weeks, and that pest control
is performed by zoo staff.
Pests, including rodents, can harbor bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause diseases that are harmful to zoo animals.
Contamination of animal feed by rodents poses a disease hazard to resident zoo animals.
Correct by establishing and maintaining a safe and effective program for the control of pests. Correct by January 1st,
2021.

Primary enclosures.
The night enclosures for two adult male colobus monkeys had flaking, peeling paint on the walls. The night enclosure for
the younger male colobus monkey had large patches of flaking and peeling paint, comprising approximately 25% of the
surface of the left wall. The right wall contained a large crack (approximately 6 feet in length) that had flaking and peeling
paint on its edges. The area on the back wall, under the wooden resting ledge, had peeling paint covering approximately
50% of the wall in this area. There were also small areas of flaking paint on the wall above the resting ledge. The wooden
resting surface itself was worn and paint peeling off the wood in multiple areas, exposing the unpainted wood beneath.
The night enclosure for the older male colobus monkey had a wooden metal sliding door that had areas of peeling and
flaking paint. There was a plastic panel coming off the wall above the resting surface in this enclosure. An employee
stated that these night enclosures were going to be repaired but a timeframe was not yet known for when the repairs


would be completed.
Surfaces that contain peeling or flaking paint cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, and may harbor organic matter or
disease-causing organisms. Cleaning and sanitization of surfaces within enclosures is important for animal health and
well-being.
Correct by February 1, 2021, by repairing or replacing the surfaces of the Colobus night enclosures so that they can be
readily cleaned and sanitized.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Interim Director.
