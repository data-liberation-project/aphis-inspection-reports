ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A Shih-Tzu (#145532122A) had a dental condition. A yellowish-brown material was covering the surface of the
dog(cid:25)s teeth. Some of the dogs teeth were missing and the dog had wet fur around the mouth. The gums were
reddened and inflamed along the cheek teeth and upper canine teeth. Also, a creamy, grey to white material was
noted along the gum line of some of these teeth. The gums had also receded along these teeth and the roots of
some of the teeth were visible. The lower left cheek teeth also had a reddish discharge, with at least one very loose
tooth. According to the licensee, this dog(cid:25)s teeth had been cleaned by a veterinarian around the time of 3/26 or 3/27
of this year. There was no additional written documentation regarding this dogs dental condition. The abnormal
build-up of material on this dogs teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This dogs dental
condition could be painful, may decrease the dogs ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of
the animal.
The licensee must have this dog seen by a licensed veterinarian no later than October 14, 2014 in order to ensure
that an accurate diagnosis is made and that appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee
must develop and establish an effective dental care program and all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all
times.
