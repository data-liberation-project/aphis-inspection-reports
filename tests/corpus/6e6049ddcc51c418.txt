INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Semi-annual Program Review.
1. The IACUC has not reviewed the research facility's Program for Animal Care and Use at least once every 6
months as required. The last review of the Program was conducted almost 8 ½ months ago on 5/18/15.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC shall review the Program for Animal Care and Use at least once
every 6 months to ensure all aspects of the Program are in compliance with the AWA Regulations.
The IACUC needs to conduct a semi-annual review of the Program for Animal Care and Use.

Semi-annual Facility Inspection.
1. The IACUC has not inspected the research facility's animal facilities at least once every 6 months as required.
The last inspection of the animal facilities was conducted almost 8 ½ months ago on 5/18/15.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC shall inspect all of the research facility'(cid:25)s animal facilities at least
once every 6 months to ensure the condition of the animal facility is in compliance with the AWA Regulations.
The IACUC needs to conduct a semi-annual inspection of the animal facilities.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Consideration of alternatives.
1. Review of Protocol #5-001: The IACUC approved protocol did not contain a written narrative description of the
methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available to the procedures that may cause more
than momentary pain and or distress to the hamsters that are described in the protocol.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC shall determine during the review of a proposal for animal use that
the
principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain
or distress to the animals and that the principal investigator has provided a written narrative description of the
methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available. This requirement is important to
ensure that the procedures involving animals in the proposal minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals.
The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for the protocol.
Correct by 3/1/16.
2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Proposals to conduct activities involving animals.
1. Review of Protocol #5-001: The IACUC approved protocol does not contain a complete description of all of the
animal use activities to be performed on the hamsters that are included in the proposal. The lack of a complete
description includes but is not limited to the following: there are no dosages, frequencies, or routes of
administration provided for many of the substances that are to be administered to the animals; and there are no
details provided for the frequency, method, and volume of blood to be collected from the animals.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a proposal to conduct an activity on animals must contain a complete
description
of the proposed use of the animals in order for the IACUC to ensure that the proposed activities meet all of the
requirements of this subchapter.
The IACUC needs to address all of the deficiencies that were identified for this protocol.
Correct by 3/1/16.2.35(a)(3)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
Recordkeeping for Reports to Institutional Official.
1. There was no copy of the Semi-annual Report to the Institutional Official (IO) available for review at time of the
inspection for the report submitted to the IO for the semi-annual review of the Program for Animal Care and Use and
the semi-annual inspection of the animal facilities that were conducted on 5/18/15.
Per this Section of the Regulations, copies of the semi-annual reports prepared by the IACUC and submitted to the
IO should be maintained and available at the time of an inspection so the required records can be reviewed to
determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA.
Correct for all Semi-annual Reports to the Institutional Official from this date forward.
3.26(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Interior surfaces.
1. The cage wash room is also used to store primary enclosures after they have been cleaned and sanitized. One
wall of the room directly behind the pallet where some of the clean primary enclosures are kept is not being
maintained so that the wall is substantially impervious to moisture. There are several areas of the wall surface
where the outer layer of the sheetrock wallboard had peeled off exposing the inner layer that is porous and can
absorb water. Porous surfaces absorb moisture and cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized.
Although the damage had been noted by facility personnel at least one month ago, no temporary measure had been
put in place to address the condition of the wall until the permanent repair could be scheduled and completed
thereby risking possible contamination of the clean primary enclosures being stored next to this wall.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the surfaces of indoor facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they
are substantially impervious to moisture to allow for cleaning and effective sanitization.
The research facility needs to repair the wall in the cage wash room and make the surface impervious to moisture to
allow for effective cleaning and sanitization by: (1) using a temporary measure to address the condition of the wall
until (2) the permanent repair can be completed.
Correct (1) by 2/5/16 and Correct (2) by 4/1/16.3.31(b)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
1. The cage wash room is also used to store primary enclosures after they have been cleaned and sanitized.
There were several areas of the room that were noted to be dirty and needed to be cleaned. The shelves of the
rack that hold some of the clean primary enclosures as well as other flat surfaces in the room had a build-up of dust
and particulate debris. There were also various small-sized surplus pieces of equipment piled on one end of
another shelf as well as other items scattered on the shelf resulting in a cluttered appearance. The presence of
clutter interferes with the ability to keep premises clean and neat.
Per this Section of the Regulations, premises shall be kept clean and free of accumulations of clutter to facilitate
prescribed housekeeping practices and ensure effective cleaning and sanitization of the facility.
The facility needs to improve the housekeeping of the cage wash room by cleaning the surfaces within the room
and the room also needs to be de-cluttered and organized.
Correct by 2/5/16.
