ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female, black and white miniature schnauzer with chip number OAO2050147 has a laceration on her right front
leg. The licensee reports the laceration is a result of grooming yesterday. The laceration is "V" shaped and through
the full thickness of the skin with a flap of skin still attached. The resulting wound is about the size of a nickel and
exposes the red tissue beneath the skin. The licensee stated that she applied ointment and tried to bandage the
wound but had not contacted the attending veterinarian as of the start of the inspection. Lacerations are painful and
can become infected. The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian by 25 Feb 2016 in order
to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This
information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made
available to the inspector upon request.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees, Kendall Lundy, ACI, and Margaret A Shaver,
VMO in attendance.
