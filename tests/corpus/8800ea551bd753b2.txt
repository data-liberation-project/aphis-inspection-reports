3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* One outdoor and two sheltered enclosures housing five adult dogs and ten puppies have excreta and dried fecal
residue caked on 40 to 50 percent of the enclosure flooring. The excreta dry in appearance and was covered with
dog hair in one enclosure. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, excreta and other
disease hazards. It indicates unsanitary living conditions exist that could increase the risks of disease transmission,
which negatively affects the health of the dogs. Accumulations of excreta can potentially create odors, serve as an
attractant for flies, insects and other pests. The clean surface area available for the dog to walk on is reduced and
excreta could potentially cause soiling on the body of the dog to occur. The licensee must remove excreta and food
waste from the primary enclosure daily and from under the primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an
excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures,
and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. Correct by 1/14/17.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 1/12/17 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
