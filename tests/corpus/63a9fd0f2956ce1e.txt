ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An inspection was attempted at the licensee's home site at 13:00 hours on 07/26/2017. A female relative answered
the door and stated that the licensee was not at the site and she believed him to be in a different state. No current
itinerary has been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal Care.
In the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail at least two
days prior to any overnight travel. The itinerary should contain complete and accurate information concerning the
whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. The
submission of itineraries allows USDA to conduct inspections in order to assess the welfare of the animals both at
home and while traveling. Current itineraries should be submitted to USDA in a timely manner.
