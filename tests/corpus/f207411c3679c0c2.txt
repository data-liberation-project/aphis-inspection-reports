ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was an 8 week old female Shiatsu puppy that was lying flat on the floor of the cage that was not moving and
breathing very shallow breaths and completely unresponsive. The licensee advised that the puppy had not been
acting right for the past day or two and he had self treated diarrhea 1-2 days prior, however the puppy was not
getting better so he tried to give it honey this morning in case it was hypoglycemic. The veterinarian had not been
contacted for proper diagnosis or treatment options with the symptoms getting worse over the past few days. By the
end of the inspection the puppy had expired.
It is important that the veterinarian is contacted immediately when an illness is observed and treatments that are
suggested by a veterinarian are not working. Timely consultation with a veterinarian can increase the chances of
survival and decrease time an animal can be in discomfort or pain from an injury or illness. Proper diagnosis and
treatment of illnesses early in their observation can increase the chances of a treatable condition being resolved
and the animal surviving.
The licensee must contact a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and/or treatment options as soon as any health issues
are observed.
To correct by: This day forward.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee.
