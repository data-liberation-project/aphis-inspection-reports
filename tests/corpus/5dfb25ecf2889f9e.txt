ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:50pm on
04/30/2015.
There was no response at the facility and I was unable to leave a message at the telephone number listed because
the voicemail was full. I sent a text message to the same number but have not received a reply.
