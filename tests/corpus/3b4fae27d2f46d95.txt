2.35(a)(1)

Recordkeeping requirements.
The last two meetings of the IACUC had notes of notable facility changes along with the semi-annual review and facility
inspection notes, however minutes that included a record of attendance, activities of the IACUC and IACUC deliberations
were not maintained. IACUC meeting minutes are a requirement of the Animal Welfare Act and help demonstrate the
functionality of the IACUC. Ensure that future IACUC meetings have minutes that record who attended, activities of the
committee and committee deliberations.

Correct from this forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
