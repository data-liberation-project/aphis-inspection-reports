FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence surrounding the facility has sections that are overgrown from adjacent bushes and other
vegetation. In addition, there are large sections where the top of the perimeter fence is bowing over into the facility.
Overgrowth of plants can compromise the strength of the fencing, and also make it difficult to see any damaged
areas. In addition, as the fencing bends down, it lowers the overall height of the fence and can decrease its
strength and effectiveness as a secondary containment for the animals.
The perimeter fence must be repaired or replaced. The licensee has planned an outer perimeter fence replacement
project. The total perimeter of the facility is approximately 11,034 feet or 2.089 miles with 9,671 feet or 1.831 miles
that still need repair/replacement. The plan will break the work into four phases: phase I will be the entire elk/bison
field along Ward Road; phase II will extend from the bear cattle guard to the Jim Lotzgesell Road stop sign; phase
III will extend from there to the Lotzgezell red house; and finally, phase IV will be the fencing from the Lotzgezell red
house to the parking lot.
