Sanitation.
During the course of the inspection, an overall lack of sanitation was witnessed. A dried brown substance which had the
appearance of dried fecal material was present on the tops of a many of the nesting structures inside the cages which are
round capped pieces of pvc pipe, approximately 4-5 inches round. Pests were present and feeding off of the excreta and
food waste in Room 1. The wooden structures used to support the cages in all 5 animal rooms are coated with a thick
brown substance that appears to be food and waste material. Inadequate sanitation poses a direct health and safety
hazard to the animals. Animals that are subjected to soiled enclosures and food can become distressed, or sick. All
enclosures and rooms must be adequately cleaned and sanitized and a proper sanitation program must be maintained.

Sanitation.
Although pest control has been increased at this facility, pests such as roaches and rodents remain an issue. Roaches
were observed in large numbers on the wall in Debbie's room and seen crawling near animal enclosures in all rooms.
Dead mice are present on the floors of several rooms and a live mouse was observed on top of one sugar glider
enclosure . Room 3 has numerous holes in the ceiling that appear to be caused by the rodents. Pest such as roaches and


rodents may spread disease and are a threat to the health and well being of the animals. An effective program for the
control of pest must be maintained .

This inspection was conducted with a facility employee. The exit briefing was conducted with the licensee by phone .
