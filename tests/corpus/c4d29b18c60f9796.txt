2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following medications were being stored in the medication cabinet in the treatment area of the veterinary clinic
at the facility and were expired or had no expiration date listed: Activated Charcoal (12/10), TriOptic Ointment
(10/31), Ivomec liquid (no date), Neomycin Polymyxin B, Bacitracin Ophthalmic ointment (12/13 and 2/14), Artificial
tears (9/14), Salix/furosemide (10/13), Ciprofloxacin tablets (Dec 13), Vitamin K injection (4-13), triple antibiotic
ointment (12/9), CalciCure liquid (Dec 13), Oti-clens (10/2013), and Revolution (5/14). The usage of expired medical
materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary
practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected
results when expired drugs are administrated to animals could be drastically changed or may not work as
anticipated. The applicant must ensure that all medications used are not expired and labeled properly in accordance
with standard veterinary practices. To be corrected by 25 November 2014.
3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.75 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces--(1) The lower edge of the metal frame of the animal egress
door in the grivet's indoor housing facility is rusted with streaks of rust running down the wall. This material has a
flaking surface. Rusted surfaces do not allow for the surfaces to be adquately cleaned and sanitized and may affect
the structural strength. All surfaces shall be constructed in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and
sanitized.
3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The written environment enhancement plan for non-human primates could not be located at the time of the
inspection. In addition, there is an individually housed spider monkey that has special attention instructions from the
attending veterinarian, but the documentation of environment enhancement for this primate does not indicate the
facility is following these instructions. Some enhancement items (popcorn and cologne) documented as being used
recently for this primate is listed on the veterinarian approved list of items as items that do not work for spider
monkeys. Individually housed nonhuman primates are at risk for behavioral problems if their social needs are notaddressed. The licensee must have a written environment enhancement plan that outlines the special attention to
be given to any individually housed nonhuman primate that is not able to see or hear nonhuman primates of their
own or compatible species. These special considerations must be based on the needs of the individual species and
be in accordance to the instructions of the attending veterinarian. Correct by 18 December 2014.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal frame supporting one side of the elevated bench in one lion indoor enclosure has come loose from the
front metal support. This frame is no longer adequately supporting the resting surface. The metal frame for the
elevated resting surface for one leopard is also no longer adequately supporting the resting surface.
There is a section of metal that had been fastened between the indoor grizzly bear enclosure and the wall that has
been bent down resulting in exposed metal edges.
There are exposed screws and nails on the ramp in the outdoor portion of the leopard enclosure.
Facilities not maintained in good repair can result in injury to the animals. All facilities must be maintained in good
repair so they are structurally sound and the animals are protected from injury. Correct by 18 December 2014.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Sec. 3.127 Facilities, outdoor. (d) Perimeter fence. There are still gaps between the lower edge of sections of the
perimeter fence and the ground, especially on the west and northwest side of the zoo. There are also gaps of up to
9 inches where two vehicle entrance gates meet. Gaps such as these may not restrict animals from going under
and through the fence. The perimeter fence must be constructed in a manner that prevents animals and
unauthorized persons from going under it and through it.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There were numerous flies in the enclosure housing one hedgehog. The flies were seen mostly on the food and on
the log in the enclosure. Flies can play a role in the deterioration of the food in the enclosure and can be irritating to
the animals. In general, flies can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must establish and maintain a
safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests. To be
corrected by 21 November 2014.
The incidence regarding the veterinary procedure for the young female African lion is still under review.This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the zoo Curator.
