SANITATION.
***There were 2 piles of animal feces on top of the stored alfalfa bales used to feed an intact male elk, named JR.
The facility owner stated that the feces is most likely from raccoons which are on the premises.
Pests can transmit diseases to regulated animals, especially when their feed and water is contaminated. The
licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote the health and
well-being of the elk and reduce contamination by pests in all animal areas. Additionally, the licensee must ensure
that the food provided to the elk is free from contamination and stored in a manner that prevents pests from
accessing it.
