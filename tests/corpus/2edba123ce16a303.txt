WATERING.
In October 2013 a gerbil died following a period of IACUC approved water restriction that was performed incorrectly.
Since then the facility has implemented measures to reduce the possibility of recurrence. Water is required for
optimal animal health and well being. If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be
provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.
