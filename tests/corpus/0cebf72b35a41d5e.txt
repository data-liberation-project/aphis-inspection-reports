ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two adult intact male Yorkshire Terriers were observed to have excessive tartar buildup and indications of dental
disease on oral exam.
One male yorkie, identified as Billy Bob (DOB 09-13-2013 ID #30), was observed to have a large amount of thick,
hard, dark brown debris/plaque material covering the majority upper cheek teeth and upper canine teeth. There was
enough of this material present to obscure individual tooth identification on some teeth. The gums also appeared
swollen and retracted from the teeth in those areas in contact with heavy plaque material.
Another male yorkie, identified as Bear (DOB 12-07-2010 ID #20), was similarly found to have thick, hard dark
brown debris/plaque material covering the majority of the upper cheek teeth and upper canine teeth. There was
also evidence of gum swelling and retraction of gums from the teeth in areas in contact with heavy debris/plaque
buildup.
Excessive tartar buildup on teeth and dental disease may lead to discomfort, difficulty chewing and weight loss.
These conditions may further impact the overall health and comfort of animals. All animals listed above must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the
condition must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all
animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.
