ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are outdated drrugs in the medication cabinet. These included a bottle of dexamethasone and prescribed
medications from veterinarians . Outdated medications may not be effective in treating diseases and conditions.
Proper veterinary care includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases
and injuries. Outdated /expired medications must be removed from indate supplies and if not discarded, marked
expired and kept separate from indate supplies. This will help to ensure that proper veterinary care is provided to
the animals. CORRECT BY : 4-17-14
