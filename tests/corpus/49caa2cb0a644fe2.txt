CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
A shipment of dogs from Korea had arrived at the cargo office on waybill # 180-1290-4986. There were eight
animals shipped in five crates. There was no consignor's certification regarding feeding and watering on the crates.
The carrier should not accept an animal for transport unless consignor certifies in writing to the carrier or
intermediate handler that the dog or cat was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the carrier
or intermediate handler. The certification must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure in a
manner that makes it easily noticed and read. The certification should include instructions for feeding and watering
during transport. Failure to provide this information to be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals. --
To be corrected from this time forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
A shipment of dogs from Korea had arrived at the cargo office on waybill # 180-1290-4986. There were eight
animals shipped in five crates. Three crates contained two dogs per crate, and five of the dogs were over six
months of age.
No more than one live dog six months of age or older may be transported in the same primary enclosure via air
carrier. Combining adult dogs in primary enclosures for air transport could jeopardize the welfare of the animals.
