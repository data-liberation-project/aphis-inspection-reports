3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Although the side walls of the enclosures measured approximately 7 inches in height, during the inspection, one guinea
pig was observed to be out of the enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The enclosure must contain the animals. The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times
and does not allow them to escape.
3.31(b)

Sanitation.
There was a large amount of discarded bedding, hay, and debris on the floor under and around the guinea pig pens.
The lack of sanitation and presence of debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and may
contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.
