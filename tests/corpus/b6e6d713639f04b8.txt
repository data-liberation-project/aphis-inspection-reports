ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female camel which was recently acquired by the licensee continually holds her head upwards (star-gazing)
and
puffs out her cheeks in a nonstop, repetitive manner. This animal must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian
to
assure that there is no physical injury or disease process which is causing this behavior. The attending veterinarian
must be consulted to determine if any medical intervention is required to treat this condition. To be corrected by:
August 10, 2016.
A female coati mundi born on 4-25-16 has been declawed and the canine teeth have been removed. Declawing
can
cause pain, discomfort, or other pathological conditions. Declawing of an animal is not appropriate veterinary care,
unless prescribed for the treatment of an individual medical problem of the foot. These declaws were not done for
this purpose. Likewise, the removal of the canine teeth in this animal is not appropriate veterinary care, unless
prescribed for the treatment of an individual dental problem. The removal of the canine teeth was not done for this
purpose. Individual animals must not be declawed or defanged in the future.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two lemurs are housed in an expanded metal cage which is extremely rusted along the bottom and in the area
where
the feed bowls are placed in the cage. The rust has compromised the structural integrity of the cage to the point
that
the two nonhuman primates could injure themselves on the sharp rusty metal edges. This cage must be repaired or
replaced to protect the two animals housed in it. To be corrected by: October 28, 2016.3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In two cages housing a total of four marmosets, there was approximately 25% of the surface of the cage floor
covered by old food debris. All hard surfaces which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned
daily
and sanitized to prevent accumulation of disease hazards. Food waste must be removed to eliminate odors,
diseases, and pest infestation. These cages must be cleaned and food waste removed daily to prevent disease and
pest problems. To be corrected by: August 5, 2016.
Multiple cages in the ringtail lemur building had excessive food debris on the cage flooring. All cages must be spot-
cleaned daily to prevent accumulation of food waste and to prevent pest control issues such as flies and roaches.
All cages in this building must be cleaned and food waste removed daily to prevent pest control problems and
potential disease transmission. To be corrected by: August 5, 2016.
3.83
WATERING.
At the time of this inspection, there was no drinking water available to any of the four gibbons housed in two outdoor
enclosures. Potable water must be offered to non-human primates as often as necessary to ensure their health and
well-being, but no less than twice daily for at least 1 hour each time. During the high summer temperatures, water
receptacles must be checked multiple times each day to assure animals have access to drinking water.
To be corrected by: August 2, 2016.
3.85
EMPLOYEES.
At the time of this inspection, it appeared that facility personnel were not checking on the gibbons drinking water or
spot-cleaning the marmosets and lemurs on a daily basis. Every facility with non-human primates must have
enough
employees to carry out an appropriate level of animal care and husbandry. The employees must be trained and
supervised by an individual with the proper knowledge, background, and experience in the care of non-human
primates. The employer must be certain that the employees can perform to these standards.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the front zebra outdoor enclosure, there were several layers of fencing along the bottom of the chain link fence.There are pieces of wire protruding inward along the bottom of the fence which could injure the animals. Several of
the metal cross bars supporting this section of fence are extremely rusted. These areas of rusted and broken
fencing
must be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury.
To be corrected by: October 28, 2016.
The red deer gate has a piece of expanded metal along the bottom of the chain link. There are also gaps in the
gate
fencing where the animals could injure a leg. This gate must be repaired or replaced in order to protect the animals
from injury. To be corrected by: October 28, 2016.
In the Ibex outdoor enclosure, there is a wooden shelter with a sagging section of roofing material. This sagging
piece of plywood appears to be detached from the shelter structure and could possibly fall onto the animals inside
the shelter. There are also two pieces of plywood laying on the ground in the vicinity of the shelter which could
potentially injure the animals. This shelter must be repaired or replaced in order to protect the animals from injury.
