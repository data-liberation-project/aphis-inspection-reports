Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The written program of veterinary care and a current list of animals-on-hand were not available at time of inspection. The
required paperwork is essential for tracking of animals at the facility and to ensure an established program of care for
them has been approved by a qualified veterinarian. During an inspection, the required records should be made available
for review.

To be corrected by February 15, 2022
