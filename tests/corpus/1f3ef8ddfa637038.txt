3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are 7 of 9 primary enclosures that have a buildup of brown oily grime on the walls and inner and outer door
flaps, and on the water pipes inside the cages. Four of the nine feeders have a buildup of brown grime in the bottom
of the feeder. There has not been a consistent sanitization schedule of the primary enclosures and food
receptacles, while they are being cleaned regularly, they are not being sanitized or cleaned enough to prevent the
grime buildup.
A buildup of dirt and grime on the surfaces in the primary enclosure can hold bacteria and be a source of disease
for the regulated animals if not cleaned properly or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup.
The licensee must adopt a sanitization schedule to keep up with the needs of the kennel. Used primary enclosures
and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the
methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of
dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
