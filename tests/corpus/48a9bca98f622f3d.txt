ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One male Yorkshire Terrier (ID # 431; DOB 4/9/01) has a constant and severe head tilt to the left. When the
inspector first approached the enclosure the dog remained curled up on a blanket and was slow to lift its head. The
right eye is severely cloudy and there is a trail of drainage and brown crusts coming from the inside corner of the
eye and mixed in with the hair on the eyelids and face.
These medical conditions can be painful, uncomfortable for the animal or lead to other medical complications. This
animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and
an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information must be documented and made available
to the inspector upon request.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by 5 pm on Friday, February 21, 2014.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the owner.
