ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The grey fox has discharge in both eyes, which may be signs of a health problem for the animal. The right eye
discharge is brownish yellow-green and crusty, the left eye has a yellowish-green discharge. The fox was observed
holding his eyes partially closed or squinting. The licensee stated he was not aware that this fox has issues with his
eyes. The attending vet was contacted by the inspector and confirmed that he was unaware of this condition in the
grey fox and that he would speak to the licensee and recommend administering the same treatment used previously
on the red fox. Daily observation of the animals is needed to recognize when there are injuries or health issues.
There must be regular direct communication with the attending veterinarian whenever injuries or health issues arise.
3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple nonhuman primate enclosures have accumulations of fecal material. Accumulations of feces may attract
unwanted insects, and be a disease hazard. The primary enclosures must be spot cleaned daily and cleaned and
sanitized as often as necessary to protect the health and well-being of the nonhuman primates.

3.75(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are hazardous liquids and solid products above, near and on a shelf over the nonhuman primate feed in the
storage shed. There are also various tools and supplies stored over and around the nonhuman primate feed. The
accumulation of debris and disorganized tools and supplies can harbor pests. Pests, as well as the debris and
supplies themselves may contaminate the food. All food and bedding must be stored in a way that prevents
contamination. Toxic substances required for normal husbandry must not be stored in the food storage area but
may be stored in cabinets.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The shelter for the pair of rhesus macaque with a baby in the back of the facility has partially collapsed and is
unstable. There is a nail protruding from the broken structure near the back. This structure is a hazard and may
collapse further and cause injury to the macaques housed there. There are damaged, broken plastic toys in the
baboon and macaque enclosures which may injure the nonhuman primates. The primary enclosures must be
constructed of materials durable enough for the species of nonhuman primates contained in them and be
maintained in good repair to protect the health, safety and welfare of the animals.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the facility, there are multiple enclosures with areas containing broken wire mesh, with sharp wire points
exposed. A raccoon enclosure has broken sharp wires protruding. There is bent, broken sharp wires exposed on
the wire mesh in the cavy enclosure. There is an area on the side of the porcupine enclosure where the wire mesh
floor was bent and broken exposing a gap that may allow the porcupines to escape their enclosure or injure
themselves on the wire. The enclosure housing the male coati-mundi in the back near the deer has rusty broken
chicken wire mesh. The broken, sharp wires pose an injury hazard to the animals. The enclosures and structures
must be structurally sound, and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The wallaby enclosure has one side of its enclosure fencing that is up against the facility perimeter fencing and
another side without a perimeter fence. There is no space barrier to stop the public or unwanted animals from
gaining direct access to the wallaby. The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the
primary enclosure or at least 3 feet to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and unwanted
animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. A perimeter fence less than 3 feet from the primary enclosure must
be approved in writing by the administrator.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was old food residue, including rotting meat in the caracal and bobcat enclosures. Decomposing food debris
can attract unwanted pests and harbor bacteria which creates a disease hazard. Leftover food debris must be
removed if not consumed.
The enclosures for the bobcat and the porcupine have accumulations of feces throughout. Accumulations of fecesharbor bacteria, attracts unwanted insects and creates a disease hazard for the animals. Feces must be removed
from the enclosures more frequently to protect the health and welfare of the animals.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There are accumulations of building supplies, pipes, wire, wood, broken animal crates and other debris
accumulated just outside the perimeter but still near the animal enclosures. There are various debris on top of the
metal roof of the male coati-mundi enclosure in the back including a hose, wooden shelter box, plastic and metal
food receptacles, a heat light, electrical wiring and a wire mesh animal enclosure. The food storage shed is
disorganized and dirty. There are supplies, tools, containers with various chemicals placed above and around the
feed containers. Pests and vermin will be attracted to the accumulations of debris around the facility. These
unwanted pests will be irritating to the animals and pose an increase disease hazard.
There is an accumulation of feces and food waste which was removed from enclosures and left in the grass and dirt
areas between and near enclosures. This waste may harbor bacteria, attract unwanted pests and create a disease
hazard.
The premises must be kept clean and organized to reduce unwanted insects and pests that may transmit disease.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the owner. An Animal Care VMO was also present and
assisted with the inspection.
