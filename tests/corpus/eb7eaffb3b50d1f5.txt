2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****A brown and white female Chihuahua (#163) was observed to be limping on the left hind leg. When the dog
moved around, she was not bearing weight on that leg. There was nothing obvious on closer inspection so this dog
should be separated from the other 4 dogs it is currently housed with and examined by a veterinarian. Leg and foot
injuries can be painful and when the dog is housed with other dogs, the dog could be aggravated by the movement
of the other dogs. The dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment. Documentation
of the exam and treatment must be created and be available for APHIS officials.
****A female Beagle (#002) has a large (approximate size of a golf ball), soft mass at the rear-most area of the
abdomen. The owner stated that she spoke with the veterinarian and treated the dog with antibiotics and it
decreased in size. When she stopped the treatment, the mass increased in size again The owner spoke about
having it removed or some other treatment but has not followed up with the veterinarian after stopping treatment
and the return of the mass. There is no documentation of treatment or conversation with the veterinarian. The
owner needs to have the dog evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the
exam and treatment must be created and be available for APHIS officials.
****A female Pekinese (#063) has a soft mass (approximate size of half a golf ball) at the rear-most area of the
abdomen. The owner stated that she had treated it the same as Beagle #002 but had no documentation of
treatment and the dog was not evaluated by a veterinarian. The dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian for proper
diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the exam and treatment must be created and be available for APHIS
officials.
2.50(a)TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
**** There were 5 dogs older than 4 months of age that had no identification on them. There were 38 unweaned
puppies that had no identification on or near them. Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's
identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements for inventory, disposition,
transport, and healthcare documentation.. The owner must identify all live regulated animals and assure that
records are kept at all times.

3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces--
****The bottom of the metal framing of at least 4 enclosures were very rusted along the bottom and side surfaces.
Two metal framed gates had excessive rust on the bottom frame and there were holes caused by the rust. Rusted
surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized because the rough surface can harbour pests and microbes that
increases the risk of disease to the dogs. The degrading of the metal surface will cause decreased structural
strength. The rusted surfaces must be repaired, replaced or removed and maintained at all times to ensure easier
cleaning and sanitizing that decreases the risk of disease.
****In the outdoor enclosure with the female Akita and young puppies, there were at least 4 sharp points on the
bottom of the horse panel adjacent to another enclosure housing a male Akita. A hole was dug into the ground near
the entrance to the shelter and within inches of the adjacent enclosure. The dirt that the female dog removed
exposed the sharp points that are pointing downwards. As the puppies move around and come out of the shelter,
they could become injured or even trapped by the sharp points. The sharp points must be removed, repaired or
covered in some way that prevents injury to the dogs and this must be maintained at all times.

3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(d) Pest control.****Inside the buildings, mouse droppings were observed on the floor and along the wall between 2 enclosures. In
the outdoor enclosures, bird feces was observed on the top lid of 3 food receptacles. Feces indicates the presence
of pests in close proximity to the dogs. Pests can carry microbes in their feces that increases the risk of
contamination and disease to the dogs. To prevent disease, the owner must have an effective program to control
the birds and mammals that are pests. The feces must be removed to prevent the dogs from coming into contact
with it and an effective pest control program must be established and maintained.
An exit interview was done with a facility representative after the inspection and when the report was delivered.
