INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 2015-15 lacks specific detail in the experimental procedure, potential complications, and follow-up care
options for potential adverse effects.
Animal use protocols (AUP) must describe in detail all components related to the care and use of animals so the
IACUC can determine if the activities comply with all relevant regulations under the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct within 30 days (by July 21, 2017) by putting in place an IACUC-approved modification that addresses all
animal use activities of the study.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility and IACUC personnel.
