3.6(c)(1)(i)

Primary enclosures.
In a 29"x29" enclosure (5.84 sq ft of floor space) there are three weaned puppies housed in it and six puppies in another
of the same size. The puppies measure eleven inches from nose to the base of the tail and so each puppy needs 2.01 sq
ft of floor space. The 29"x29" enclosures provide minimum space for 2 puppies that are 11 inches long. A lack of space
could cause health problems in dogs. Ensure that weaned puppies have at least the minimum required space as outlined
in the Animal Welfare Act (USDA technical note with minimum space chart was also left with the licensee at exit
interview).

(Note: facility has extra enclosures that they began to make ready so that all weaned puppies have adequate space)
3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Eight of the outdoor runs have not had daily spot cleaning; licensee said that outdoor spot cleaning is done every few
days. Also, the trays under two enclosures with weaned puppies had a strong odor when I stood by them and licensee
said trays are cleaned about every 4 days. Daily spot cleaning of all surfaces dogs can contact are required, including
outdoor runs. Pans under primary enclosures such as the weaning enclosure must be cleaned often enough to prevent


excessive odors. A lack of daily spot cleaning can cause animal health problems and animal discomfort. Ensure that all
surfaces of adult dog runs are daily spot cleaned and that the pans under weaning pens are cleaned more often to
prevent strong odors.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) does not have a written plan from the attending veterinarian for heartworm
and fecal sampling. A lack of a written plan does not ensure that important health sampling will be completed. The written
PVC must have a sampling schedule approved by the attending veterinarian for heartworm and fecal sampling.

3.13(b)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee reports that the AV took a fecal sample in the fall and also a heartworm test on 11/28/22, however a record
of each test results from the attending veterinarian was not available. The dates and findings/results of all screening,
routine, or other required tests or examinations are required to be kept on record by the licensed facility. Ensure to
request and maintain records of results for tests that the AV conducts on animals.
