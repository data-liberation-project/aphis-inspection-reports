Sanitation.
At least 70% of the approximately 270 primary enclosures for hamsters and guinea pigs are excessively full of feces and
urine, and another 20% include petrified dead hamsters whose cause of death is unknown. There is also food waste on
top of the wet and soiled bedding. The majority of the enclosures for hamster have more feces contained in them than
bedding. The licensee stated that she has two employees that usually clean the primary enclosures and they have not
been available for one month. Even through the surgical mask worn for inspection the odor of ammonia and decaying
animals is overwhelming in the building containing the hamsters, guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus. Some enclosures

have a small layer of clean bedding that has been added over the wet and soiled bedding decreasing the amount of head
space for the hamsters housed in these enclosures. One of the guinea pig enclosures has caked on feces and other
organic material on the plastic bottom, and the metal rungs that make up the primary enclosure housing 2 guinea pigs.
The hamster and guinea pig enclosures are not being properly sanitized. The licensee stated that the enclosures are
being scrapped out, sprayed with sanitizer, and wiped out weekly. The licensee stated that she can only keep up with
feeding and watering of the animals without the help of others.

Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris and shall
be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. If primary enclosures become soiled or wet to a degree that might be harmful or
uncomfortable to the animals therein due to discharges from dead or dying animals, spoiled perishable foods, or moisture
condensation, the guinea pigs or hamsters shall be transferred to clean primary enclosures. Primary enclosures for
guinea pigs or hamsters shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water at 180 °F, and soap or detergent as in a
mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective
disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam.

Primary enclosures for hamsters and guinea pigs must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent the
accumulation of urine, feces, dead animals, and food waste. Sanitizing enclosures requires washing all organic material
from surfaces prior to the use of a sanitizing solution. Failure to remove dead animals in primary enclosures for hamsters
can lead to contamination of the animal, uncomfortable living conditions, and disease transmission.

Employees.
The primary enclosures for the hamsters and guinea pigs are excessively dirty with urine, feces, dead hamsters, and
caked feces and organic material. The licensee stated she is unable to clean as needed without the help of others. The
licensee stated she can only keep up with feeding and watering without assistance.

A sufficient number of employees shall be utilized to maintain the prescribed level of husbandry practices set forth in this
subpart.

Enough employees must be used to ensure that primary enclosures for animals are cleaned and sanitized as necessary
to prevent animals from living in enclosures that contain excessive urine, feces, food waste, and in the presence of dead
animals.
