ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**While travelling back from the road, an 8 yr. adult female white Bengal tiger, "Munia" (H430W) died on 04/25/17
before getting back to the home facility. The trainers tried unsuccessfully to contact a veterinarian while on the road
to provide veterinary treatment. The trainer contacted the attending veterinarian to notify him of the death of the
tiger ("Munia"). The attending veterinarian indicated the need for performing a necropsy in order to determine the
cause of death, however, was unable to do so because he was unable to get approval to perform the necropsy from
the owner. The attending veterinarian should have authority to provide oversight and adequate veterinary care to
the animals. Lack of timely veterinary care can lead to pain and suffering of the animals. Licensee must have
animals evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner as veterinary care issues arise.
CORRECTION: FROM THIS DAY FORWARD
