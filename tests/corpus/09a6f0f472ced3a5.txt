FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Several of the enclosures have sections of the fencing that is not buried in the ground which could be a potential
hazard to the animals, if they get a foot or leg caught in the wire mesh. In addition a few of the enclosures have top
mesh that is sagging into the enclosure and need to be tightened to keep the enclosure structurally sound. These
enclosures need to be maintained in good repair for the safety and containment of the animals.
*** One fox enclosure along the back fence had bottom mesh that was not secured to the base frame so there was
a gap in the enclosure. Additionally both of these foxes sustained leg and paw injuries by an animal that was able to
get to them through the wire mesh near the food. This was according to the licensee and one fox had its front leg
amputated. These enclosures must be constructed to protect the animals from injury, contain them and prevent
access from other animals. These enclosures need to be addressed for the safety of the animals.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The top section of mesh for the perimeter fencing is down and is waiting to be replaced. There are several
sections where the fence is not 8 feet high. These areas of the perimeter fence need to be addressed to act as a
secondary containment for the animals and prevent unauthorized persons from entering the area.
3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** The opossums are still housed in the barn in stacking stainless steel enclosures. The enclosures do not provide
sufficient space to allow the opossum(cid:25)s adequate freedom of movement. Opossums are semi arboreal animals and
need to have some vertical space to climb and engage in this normal adjustment. In addition these are active
nocturnal animals and will walk extended periods of time. These animals need to be provided an enclosure that
provides sufficient space for their health and well- being.3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** The facility has a lot of miscellaneous items, clutter and trash in the main area around animal enclosures. This is
creating areas for pests to live and does not promote good housekeeping practices.
*** Additionally enclosures that are empty like the opossum and fox enclosure have not been cleaned and there is
old food and feces still in the enclosure. When excess food is left in enclosures the area becomes an attractant to
pests and contributes to the odor in the area. These enclosures need to be cleaned in a timely manner to reduce
disease hazards and areas for pests to breed and live.
*** The cleaning hose was left too close to the coyote enclosure and the coyotes were able to pull a significant
amount of the hose into the enclosure and left it chewed in multiple pieces. This can be a potential hazard to the
animals if the hose is ingested and not able to be passed safely. Items used for daily husbandry care need to be
secured when not in use for the safety of the animals.
*** The barn is currently housing the opossums and an African crested porcupine. The area directly around the
animals needs to be cleared out of any clutter and items that do not pertain directly to the husbandry of the animals.
This is to keep the area in good repair and facilitate good housekeeping practices.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection.
