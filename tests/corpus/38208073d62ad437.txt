PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the outdoor enclosure to the left of the pedestrian door against the small building housing three big dogs there
was a standard poodle entangled around the neck and shoulders in the remains of a carpet remnant that had been
used as a wind and rain break at the entrance of a shelter. The dog did not suffer any injuries and had all four feet
firmly on the ground. The licensee was able to untangle the dog during the inspection, but the carpet remnant
remained.
Materials in disrepair in a primary enclosure can lead to injury to the animals. While this animal was not injured in
this instance, the potential of serious, if not fatal results, could occur from hazards, such as this within primary
enclosures. Materials used in ALL primary enclosures must be suitable and kept in good repair.

The build-up of dirt, feces, and debris can harbor diseases. The licensee must spot-clean all used primary
