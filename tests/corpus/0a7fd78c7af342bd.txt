Handling of animals.
On Feb 20, 2021, a keeper, while trying to shift two jaguars (a younger male and older female) - that were housed
separately - between enclosures, mistakenly opened the wrong shift door. When the keeper realized the door he was
trying to open was not moving, he immediately tried close the door he was inadvertently opening. The door was only
partly opened when the younger male jaguar squeezed through the opening and attacked the older female. The keeper,
along with the help of other keepers, tried to separate the two animals mid-attack using techniques they were trained to
use in such circumstances - including fire extinguishers and pepper spray. Once the animals were separated, the female
was found unresponsive and died as a result of the attack.
Improper handling, in this case shifting, of animals can affect the well-being of the animal and even lead to injury and/or
death. Handling of all animals should be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma and
physical harm. In response to the incident, the facility added an additional lock for shifting animals which is used as a tool
to have the keepers stop and confirm they are opening the right doors.

Handling of animals.
On Wednesday, July 28, 2021, a zoo patron climbed over the wooden public barrier fence, which was just under 4 ft in
height. The distance between the netted enclosure and the barrier was approximately 4 ft as well. There was also plant
vegetation, including shrubs with thorns along the leaves, planted between the enclosure and the public barrier fence. The
man proceeded to stick one of his arms through the netting of the jaguar’s enclosure to play with the animal. The animal
hooked its nails into the man’s skin on his arm and thus caused several lacerations. The man was able to get his arm free
and headed towards the exit unannounced.
Dangerous animals, including large cats, pose a risk for potential injury/harm to themselves and/or humans in an
exhibitory setting. Therefore, adequate public barriers are paramount for the safety and well-being of both species. During
public exhibition, animals must be handled so there is minimal risk or harm to the animal and the public, with sufficient
distance, and/or barriers, between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of both parties.

Facilities, general.
On the third day of inspection, the inspectors found a piece of wood along the top border of the manatee enclosure that
was rotting. The wooden plank panel, that was attached to the netting structure as a public barrier, had three holes in it in
the areas where the nails were screwed into it to support the netted barrier. Each hole measured anywhere from
approximately 2-4 inches in length by 1-1.5 inches wide. If housing facilities are not maintained in good repair, they pose
a health and well-being hazard to the animals. Outdoor housing facilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound
and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals therein from injury.
