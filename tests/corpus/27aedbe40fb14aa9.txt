3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There are at least 13 out of the 40 enclosures housing 130 adults with their offspring with accumulations of excreta
and soiled bedding. More excreta than clean bedding were present in these 13 enclosures. Accumulations of
excreta and soiled bedding can expose the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungal, and parasites.
Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation
of excreta and soiled bedding, and that enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by February
27, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
