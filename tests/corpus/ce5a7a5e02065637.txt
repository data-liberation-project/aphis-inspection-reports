3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The roof of the barn housing three reindeer, hay, feed, and other storage is in disrepair. The metal sheeting on the
east slope of the roof is bent and torn away from the rafters creating a large hole. The hole is not directly over the
deer, but prevents the barn from being weather tight. Loose roofing may be blown and fall into enclosures creating
an injury hazard for the animals. Facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury. The barn roof shall be replaced, repaired, or resurfaced to fix the broken and exposed area.
