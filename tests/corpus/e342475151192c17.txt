2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no program of veterinary care available for review at the time of the inspection.
The written program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the
written program of veterinary care is available for review during USDA inspections.
Correct for all future inspections.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Animal records were not available for review at the time of the inspection. Records disclosing the source and
disposition of regulated animals at the facility should be accessible for review by APHIS officials.
Correct for all future inspections.
3.80(a)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A mongoose was present in the spider monkey enclosure, escaping the enclosure through a gap between the
cement flooring and the section of chain link fencing at the far end of the enclosure. The edge of the cement flooring
was irregular and appeared to have broken off.
The only water for the geriatric spider monkey was a lixit near the floor of the enclosure. Staff at the facility stated
that the animal had been having health problems. The plywood den for the monkey was near the top of the
enclosure, thus the animal had to descend to the floor to access water.
Metal structures and the chain link fencing that comprised the enclosure sides were covered in rust and the plywood
den box did not appear to have been sealed. Primate housing should be constructed and maintained to protect the health and well-being of the animal. Rusted
metal and unsealed wood cannot be adequately cleaned and my pose a health threat to the animal. Water should
be easy to access for the animal to ensure that it can maintain adequate hydration. Failure to drink because the
water source is difficult to access may exacerbate other health problems in addition to causing primary dehydration.
Wildlife entering the enclosure may injure the animal directly or contaminate the enclosure. The facility should
ensure that the primate housing receives regular and timely maintenance.

3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There was no environment enhancement plan available for review. The only non-human primate being housed at
the facility, a spider monkey, had little in the way of environmental enrichment. The only objects in the enclosure
consisted of a den box, two empty food bowls, a suspended tire, and a rope ladder spanning the length of the
enclosure. There was no food in the enclosure at the time of the inspection.
Environment enhancement should be provided to promote the psychological well-being of non-human primates,
with primates being housed alone receiving special attention. The facility should ensure that a written plan for
environment enhancement, directed by the attending veterinarian, is available for review for APHIS inspections and
that the plan is followed as directed by the attending veterinarian.

3.82(d)
FEEDING.
Two plastic food receptacles in the primate enclosure were dirty. One receptacle was on the floor of the enclosure
and accessible to the wildlife entering through a defect in the floor. The second receptacle was attached to the side
of the enclosure near the den box and thus appeared difficult to adequately clean.
Cleaning and sanitizing food receptacles is necessary to prevent contamination of food by infectious organisms.
The facility should ensure that all food receptacles are cleaned and sanitized as specified in the regulations.Correct by August 29, 2014.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Wire fencing in one corner of the goat enclosure was in disrepair. One section of fencing above the animal's shelter
had been constructed without trimming the wire points. A second section had of fencing had come loose from a
board leaving a small gap and exposed wire points.
Animals may injure themselves in holes or gaps in fencing and on exposed wire ends. The fencing should be
maintained in good repair in order to protect and contain the animals.
Previous correction date: Correct within 30 days, by 1-17-2013.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was insufficient shelter from rain for one large pig. The only shelter for the pig were pieces of plywood cut to
fit into two separate corners of the enclosure. The area under the plywood was not large enough to protect the
entire pig from the rain.
Heavy and prolonged periods of rain can be expected in the Hawaiian islands. The inability to take shelter from the
rain may adversely affect the health and comfort of animals. The facility should ensure that sufficient shelter is
provided to the animals in order to protect them from rain.
