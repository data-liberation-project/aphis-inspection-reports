3.4(b)(4) DIRECT REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The 27 plastic shelter structures being used by 26 dogs in the outdoor housing area contain very little or no bedding
material. The inspector recorded a temperature of 17.0 degrees F using the Kestrel device at the time of inspection.
According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature last night was -2 degrees F. The forecast for the
low temperature tonight is 10.0 degrees F. Most of the dogs that are in the outdoor housing area on the east side
are small breed dogs. The licensee stated he could provide all the shelters with sufficient bedding material this
afternoon.
Dogs that are not provided with clean and dry bedding material during low ambient temperatures can have difficulty
maintaining a safe body temperature. The licensee must provide bedding when the ambient temperatures are below
50 degrees F and additional bedding when the temperature is below 35 degrees F.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an excessive accumulation of frozen animal waste, packed snow and ice covering most of the ground
surface within the outdoor enclosures. The affected enclosures are located on the northeast and northwest side of
the property. Within at least two enclosures the packed snow and ice is up to approximately 2 inches thick. At least
26 dogs have to walk on the packed snow and frozen feces to get from one end of the enclosure to the other. The
licensee stated the enclosures were last cleaned out about a week and a half ago when the temperatures were
above freezing. The licensee also stated the snow, ice and inclement weather has affected the frequency in which
the outdoor enclosures are cleaned.
Excessive accumulations of animal waste in the primary enclosures can increase disease risks and can result in the
dogs becoming soiled. The licensee must ensure that animal waste is removed from all primary enclosures on a
daily basis or more often if needed. The snow and ice must also be removed to prevent the dogs from becoming
wet and to help facilitate proper cleaning and sanitization of the enclosures being used.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
