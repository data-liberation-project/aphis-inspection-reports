2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Two adult female sheep have overgrown hooves. The toes on both sheep are long and in need of trimming. The
hind toes on the sheep with the black face are turning in an outward direction due to a lack of recent hoof trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
As part of the facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive
appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
These two sheep need to have their hooves trimmed by July 15, 2017.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The metal wiring attached to a gate in an enclosure containing three adult female cows was in disrepair. Portions
of the wiring were loose, creating gaps between the wire and the gate, and several sharp points were pointing into
the enclosure.
***A plastic slide in an enclosure containing six goats had three screw tips exposed. The screws were pointing
upwards on the slide bed where the goats could easily come into contact with the sharp points.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
At the time of the inspection, the slide was repaired by facility staff.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives, APHIS intern, and APHIS inspector.
