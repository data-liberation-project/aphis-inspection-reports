(b) Shelter from the elements. There are numerous nonhuman primate enclosures and shelters that do not provide
adequate protection from the rain, wind and cold. The shelters for the ringtail lemurs, most rhesus macaques,
vervets, and javan macaque also did not have a heat source for when the ambient temperature falls below 45 deg.
F. The night before this inspection the temperature dropped below 45 deg. F for more than 4 hours according to the
published weather data. Exposure to rain, wind and cold can cause discomfort and be a health hazard to the
nonhuman primates. Outdoor housing facilities must provide adequate shelter from any weather conditions that may
occur and heat must be provided when the ambient temperature falls below 45 deg. F for more than 4 hours to
ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

Sec. 3.131 Sanitation.
(a) Cleaning of enclosure
The bobcat enclosure, containing 2 animals, and the raccoon enclosure, containing 3 raccoons, has a build up of
feces within their enclosures. This contamination of feces can create a disease hazard for the animals. Excreta

manner of disorder. Rodents and pests can live and build living areas in the accumulations of debris around the
facility.
There is an accumulation of dog waste that was washed out of a dog kennel onto the ground and near the regulated
animal enclosures. This waste may harbor bacteria, attract unwanted insects and create a disease hazard.
