Watering
Five approximately 10-week-old mixed-breed puppies did not have continuous access to drinking water. When the water
receptacle was filled at approximately 2:30PM, all the puppies drank eagerly from the water, pushing one another out of
the way to get to the water. The puppy who drank the longest drank for 45 seconds before stopping. The licensee stated
that the puppies had water last night but that they knock over their water bowls. Puppies who do not have continuous
access to drinking water may become thirsty or dehydrated. Correct by 9/12/22 by ensuring that all dogs and puppies
have access to continuous drinking water. Corrected at the time of the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
