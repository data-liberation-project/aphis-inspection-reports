ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspector arrived at 2:10 PM on 8/10/16 to conduct an inspection based on the shop's hours of operation but
the shop was closed and there was no one on the premises. The inspector contacted the Licensee by phone and
learned that she had closed early and was at a distant off-site location and was not available to accompany the
inspector on an inspection.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other facility representative available
to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility
and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 8/11/16.
