3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The unopened bags of dog food are stored in a food storage bin and upon opening the bin a mouse was seen
running across the top of the dog food sacks. There is a large amount of spilled food laying around the food bags
and a large amount of mouse feces was mixed in with the spilled food. Mouse feces were also observed laying on
the food bags and across the top of the storage bin. The licensee stated that he does not have any mouse control
for that area, but does have a cat that has access to the area around the food storage bin. The presence of mice
could cause contamination of the food which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.
An effective program for the control of pests must be established and maintained. The licensee must develop and
follow an effective mouse control program that promotes the health and well-being of the dogs and ensures the dog
food will not become contaminated.
