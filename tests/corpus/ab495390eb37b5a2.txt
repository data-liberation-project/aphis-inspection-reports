MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on16-AUG-18 at 1500 hrs.
The program director informed the inspector during the last inspection (conducted 17 August 2017) that Brown
Mackie College was going out of business as of 30 August 2017. The inspector visited the place of (previous)
business during this attempted inspection and found the site was completely vacant -- no furniture, no people, etc.
The inspector then tried calling the number on file but it has been disconnected.
