**We arrived on the premises at 11:45 am. We spoke with some employees and they stated that the owner was
unavailable but they would contact him. We received a call from the owner that he was unavailable for an
inspection. We explained to the owner that this would be an attempted inspection and to provide optimal hours for
future inspections. We left the facility at 12:15 pm.
