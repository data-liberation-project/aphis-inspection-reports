3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient space was being provided to four enclosures located along the wall housing 25 or more weanling
guinea pigs in each. Enclosures measure 28 inches by 36 inches or 1008 square inches of floor space. Weanling guinea
pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at least 60 square inches of floor space per animal. Can house house more than
16 weanlings in this size enclosure.

Insufficient space was also being provided to three top enclosures in row 2 housing 20 or more weanling guinea pigs in
each. Enclosures measure 19 inches by 38 inches or 722 square inches of floor space. Can not house more than 12
weanlings in this size enclosure.

Inadequate space can cause stress, overcrowding, health problems, and increased aggression in animals. Licensee must
ensure that guinea pigs are provided with at least the minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent unnecessary
stress and discomfort. Correct by February 10, 2022.
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.

Guinea pig enclosures had accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding. Enclosures are currently being cleaned weekly.
The cleaning process (method and frequency) is not effective in removing this accumulation. Ineffective cleaning and
sanitation can expose the animals to disease hazards, and decrease air quality from high ammonia levels. Primary
enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and soiled bedding. In addition,
enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Licensee must ensure that enclosures are cleaned and
sanitized often enough to prevent accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding. Correct by February 3, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
