3.125(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
REPEAT
In at least 6 enclosures, there are blocks of wood being used as enrichment. The animals have chewed these wood
blocks to the extent that they are exposing nails which were inside them that now poses an injury hazard. Most of
these were removed during the inspection. Direct injury and infection can occur by exposing animals to sharp or
rusted objects. Remove any enrichment containing sharp or rusty objects.
DIRECT/REPEAT
Several occupied enclosures contained a tray on the floor in the past which the animals had direct contact with.
These trays have since been removed, exposing 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring underneath. Other enclosures
in the back room have always had 1 inch 1 inch flooring. Underneath one of these enclosures, the body of a
newborn chinchilla was discovered mostly buried in waste and decomposing. It is apparent that the chinchilla was
born in the enclosure above it, and fell through the 1 inch by 1 inch gap. The flooring does not protect the animals
from injury, as the gaps between the wire are much larger than the feet of the chinchillas. Materials that come in
contact with the animals must protect the animals from injury. Ensure that the enclosures are structurally sound and
maintained appropriately.
3.126(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Lighting
While some sections of the facility now have adequate lighting, there continues to be one long section in the backroom of the facility which does not have adequate lighting and a flashlight has to be used to properly inspect some
animals and enclosures. Without adequate lighting, there is no way to conduct daily observations of the animals
and enclosures. Adequate lighting must be available in areas where animals are present.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
Water Receptacles
There continues to be many sections of the watering line that has an excessive buildup of hair, cobwebs, and
excreta built up on them. Unclean watering lines can contaminate the water supply which can affect the animals in
a negative way. All watering lines must be cleaned or replaced in order to assure a clean supply of water to the
animals.
3.131(a) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures
There continues to be an excessive accumulation of excreta and food waste in several of the primary enclosures.
At least one animal could not find space in its enclosure where it could stand or walk without being in waste. That
animal was moved to another enclosure during the inspection. New enclosures have a buildup of hair and used
shavings accumulating just outside of the enclosure. The facility failed to maintain the primary caging of these
animals in a sanitary condition. Unsanitary conditions can lead to biological disease hazards and can affect the
comfort of the animals as well as their health and well-being. Eliminate the buildup of waste material from the
primary enclosures and maintain in a clean and sanitary condition.
3.131(c) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
Housekeeping
The facility has an overly excessive accumulation of soiled bedding, excreta, feed, non used cages, enclosure parts,
and construction material throughout the facility. Some of the trough areas have been cleaned since the previous
inspection, however others in the back room have not. There was an extremely unpleasant and strong ammonia like
smell inside the facility during the inspection. The licensee did turn on exhaust fans at the beginning of the
inspection, however, the inspector had to exit the facility twice during the inspection because of a burning sensationin his eyes and lungs because of the smell. These areas can contain insects or vermin, can contaminate clean
materials, or can make the atmosphere inside the facility unsafe to breathe. The facility must be cleaned and any
unused hardware must be moved somewhere away from active enclosures.
This was a focused inspection directed at non compliances listed on the June 9, 2014 report.
Veterinary care non compliances listed on the June 9 report have since been corrected.
Inspection was conducted on 7/23/2014
Exit interview was conducted on 7/24/2014
The licensee refused to sign the inspection report citing that it did not accurately depict improvements made at the
facility since the last inspection.
