On February 9, 2018, at approximately 11:20 am two adult chimpanzees (a male named Cory and a female named
Corny) had managed to escape their primary enclosure and were reported to local authorities as to be loose on the
property. Law enforcement and emergency response units promptly responded to the licensee's property,
established a no-enter perimeter, and were able to capture and return safely both animals to their enclosure. To
acquire details about the incident, I interviewed the facility's supervisor, an animal keeper, and state inspectors.
Also, I conducted a thorough review of the facility's administrative, training, and animal medical records, coming to
the conclusion that the incident was due to human error. The incident happened when a new employee that was
cleaning the primary enclosure, got distracted, left unattended the unlocked enclosure, and both animals moved
from an unsecured chute into the unsecured enclosure; animals push two gates and escaped. The new employee
lacked experience handling nonhuman primates (NHP), and was obviously in need of additional training handling
NHP.
Every facility subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3) maintaining apes and other NHP,
must have enough well trained employees to carry out the level of husbandry practices and care of NHP.
Even-though the licensee fired the new employee the same day on the incident, the facility is, with their current
manpower, able to handle proper husbandry and needed care of their resident NHP; additional animal caretakers
are to he hired.
This noncompliance was corrected prior to the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
