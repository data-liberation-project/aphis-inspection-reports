3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The structural support fence poles on the West side of the enclosure housing 2 lions named "Lexus" and "Lulu" are
leaning outward. Also, the fencing around the fallow deer yard is loose on the south and east sides near the
southeast corner post. These structural supports must be straightened and the fence tightened to ensure the
enclosures maintains their structural strength to properly contain the animals. This also must be completed to
satisfy generally accepted good repair standards expected of all facilities. The licensee must ensure all enclosures
are maintained in good repair and are structurally strong enough to contain the animals.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The indoor area for the cougars requires cleaning. There are cob/dust webs throughout this area and several
indoor enclosures for the animals are dirty and require cleaning. Failure to provide clean housing
facilities/enclosure for the animals can expose them to unnecessary disease risks. Correct this by cleaning an
maintaining this and all animal housing areas in sanitary conditions.
