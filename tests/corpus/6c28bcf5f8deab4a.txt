Facilities, general.
There was an opened floor panel approximately 1 foot wide by 3 foot long on the front section of the guinea pig trailer to
allow fresh air. The open floor panel does not prevent other animals such as rodents from entering, nor does it prevent
any loose guinea pigs from escaping though the floor and falling to the ground outside the trailer. Housing facilities must
be structurally sound to protect the guinea pigs from injury, prevent guinea pigs from escaping, and restrict other animals
from entering the trailer. The opened floor panel must be closed or covered with a material that prevents guinea pigs from
escaping and restricts other animals from entering the trailer. Correct by April 23, 2022.

Watering.
There was a buildup of dirt and debris around the base of the water valves, wire mesh supporting the valves, and
drainpipe below the water valves. The buildup of dirt and debris can increase the risk of bacterial and fungal diseases.
Licensee must ensure that water valves and devices are sanitized when dirty to prevent health risks to the guinea pigs.
