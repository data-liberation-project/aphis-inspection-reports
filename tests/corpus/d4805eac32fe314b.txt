2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Each breeder must maintain a program that provides adequate veterinarian care to dog's in their facility. A light
brown Chihuahua, identification number 4714653013, has a buildup of dark colored tartar covering most of the
upper
premolar and molar teeth on both sides. Also, the upper canine teeth have a buildup of dark colored tartar, too. A
buildup of tartar on dogs' teeth can lead to tooth decay and gum disease. Dental disease can damage gum tissue,
be painful and impact the dogs' ability to eat normal, affecting the overall health of the animal. The breeder must
have this dog seen by a veterinarian, to have the dogs' teeth properly cleaned and proper care continued. The
licensee must document the outcome of this cleaning and make it available to inspector upon request. Correct this
by 08-18-2016.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative and Karl Thornton, ACI.
