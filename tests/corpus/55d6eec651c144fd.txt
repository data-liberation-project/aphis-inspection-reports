ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:00pm on
05/09/2016. The licensee's wife was at home and indicated that the licensee was working late and would not be
available. No other responsible personnel were available to accompany the inspector. As suggestion for optimal
hours, the licensee's wife indicated that Mondays he works until 6:00pm and will not be available.
Lack of availability for inspection prevents any oversight by APHIS Officials in enforcement of the Animal Welfare
Act. Correct by establishing optimal hours for inspection with the home inspector, and ensuring that a responsible
adult is available during those times for inspection. Correct from this time forward.
