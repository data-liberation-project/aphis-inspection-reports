Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Ten of 18 guinea pigs house together in an above-ground enclosure were observed with multiple hairless skin
lesions/areas. The facility representative informed that all animals in the enclosure were recently acquired by a donation
from a local patron; apparently the affected areas were not noticeable at arrival. Both inspectors assessed the affected
animals’ condition, concluding that immediate medical attention was needed. The facility representative stated their
attending veterinarian (AV) was visiting the facility the next day, and the animals would be seen by the AV. To ensure
adequate veterinary care for all guinea pigs, the AV needs to examine, diagnose and treat as appropriate to alleviate the
ongoing medical condition and/or discomfort on the affected animals.

Facilities, outdoor.
Three enclosures containing three adult female rabbits with their respective kits/bunnies (13 total) were observed having
inappropriate shading, which was causing visible overheating and discomfort on the animals. The plastic shading cloth
was damaged and not protecting all animals from direct sunlight. When sunlight is likely to cause overheating or


discomfort, sufficient and effective shade shall be provided to allow all rabbits to protect themselves from the direct rays of
the sun. The shading cloth needs to be replaced or fixed as soon as possible.

Correct by: Facility personnel started fixing/replacing damaged shading at the time of inspection.
3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Five rabbit enclosures housing 24 animals were observed having several sharp/pointy metal wires around areas of the
attached feeders, waterers, and nesting boxes. Primary enclosures for rabbits must be structurally sound and always
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. All sharp/pointy metal wires in the affected enclosures must
be replaced/fixed as soon as possible.
