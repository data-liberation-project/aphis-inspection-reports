2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Male Westie (chip #105774846) was found in need of veterianry care on an inspection dated 16 October 2014.
The licensee stated he contacted the attending veterinarian to have this animal examined but the veterinarian was
not available until today (28 OCT 2014). Today the dog's foot appears to have improved and the pea sized mass is
no longer present. The dog is not limping and does not appear painful when this foot is palpated. The licensee
must still have this animal examined by the attending veterinarian to determine if any futher treatment is required for
this animal. Treatment recommendations and treatments must be documented and maintained for future review by
APHIS officials.
Failure to provide prompt appropriate care to the animals for medical concerns may lead to prolonged pain and
suffering.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED
