ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A geriatric lion was found to have a chronic, ulcerated sore on the scrotum. This lion should be evaluated by a
veterinarian to assess his health and appropriate treatment. Both lions on site should be checked on a regular basis
in order to identify any health problems in a timely manner.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two horizontal support beams across the middle portion of a geriatric lion's enclosure. An area of this
support beam has separated resulting in a gap. It is large enough to allow an unauthorized animal to enter the
enclosure and/or may lead to continued separation of the beams if not repaired. The gap should be reduced to
minimize the risk of injury to the animal.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At least 3 areas of the perimeter fence along the back wall of the animal compound is damaged. The chain link
fence has become separated from the top support beam resulting in large holes.These areas should be repaired.
The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a
secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
