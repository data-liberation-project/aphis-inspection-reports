SANITATION.
There is an area at the facility that houses badgers and fishers. One of the enclosures housing a breeding pair of
fishers has a plastic barrel placed on its side with the top cut off. This barrel is to serve as shelter for the animals.
Inside the barrel there was a large pile of excreta. The pile of excreta was approximately a foot wide and at least six
inches tall. The straw bedding in the enclosure appeared wet and soiled. The zookeeper reported the enclosure
had not been cleaned since spring because the fishers are aggressive. Excessive animal excreta/waste and soiled
bedding in enclosures increases the risk of disease in the animals. Enclosures must be cleaned regularly and
frequently to protect the health and wellbeing of the animals. Appropriate animal handling methods must be
employed and practiced to allow regular and frequent cleaning of enclosures.
