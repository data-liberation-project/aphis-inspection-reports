Item Veterinary Care 2.33 b 5
At the time of inspection the investigators' lab on the 6th floor was found to have outdated drugs to include
phenylephrine exp 12/14, rocuronium exp 5/15, epinephrine exp 5/15, atropine sulfate exp 2/15.
In addition the IACUC conducted their inspection in Apr of 2015 and did not see or remove or make mention of the
drugs that were either outdated or soon to be outdated.
The use of outdated drugs does not constitute adequate veterinary care and the IACUC needs to insure its
inspections are complete and in depth for the monitoring of drugs.
