ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:00 on
09-Nov-16.
Arrived at the facility around 10:00 am. I knocked on the door and there was no answer, I called the phone number
for the facility and left a voicemail message, I then waited half an hour. After half an hour had passed I once again
called and knocked on the door, there was still no answer.
