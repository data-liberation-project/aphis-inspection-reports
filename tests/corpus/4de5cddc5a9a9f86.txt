ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:45 PM on
05-Apr-18.Inspector attempted to contact licensee by knocking on the door, and calling the licensees cell phone and
leaving a message. This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection. The licensee
returned my call while still at the facility. The licensee was out of town and was not able to return for inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
