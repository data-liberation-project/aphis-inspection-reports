ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On February 13th, 2017, the licensee received a Havanese puppy that was returned from a buyer (originally sold on
February 6th, 2017). The puppy had been examined by a veterinarian and found to be positive for parvovirus. The
licensee transported the animal back to their facility but never contacted the attending veterinarian (AV) to have the
animal examined, confirm the diagnosis, or receive guidance for the care of the puppy. The puppy was seen by the
facility attending veterinarian 8 days later when the AV visited to the facility for another reason. Failure to
communicate with the attending veterinarian concerning potentially contagious diseases can result in failure to
control, prevent the spread of, and treat these diseases. The licensee must ensure that frequent and timely
communication with the attending veterinarian is provided for all future health concerns. Correct this by
communicating with your attending veterinarian and following guidance provided.
Correct from this day forward.
This was a focused inspection on one Havanese puppy.
Physical inspection conducted on March 2, 2017 with the licensee. Exit interview conducted by phone with the
licensee on April 18, 2017.
