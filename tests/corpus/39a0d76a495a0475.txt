Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records of guinea pigs on hand is only being done monthly for weanlings, and not for adults and newborns. Record of
deaths is only being kept monthly. Failure to keep complete records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony
by identifying animal losses by death or decreased number of animals born , and to track guinea pigs being used for
regulated activities to ensure their humane care and use. The facility must maintain records containing the required
information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired, and disposed
of including births and deaths. Correct by January 12, 2021.
