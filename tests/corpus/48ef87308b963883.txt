ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Havanese (Microchip # 096-810-265) has a wound on its right front foot. The wound is approximately 1
inch long and is located along the top aspect of the foot. The hair around the wound appears wet and discolored
with a red-pink tinged fluid. The area around the wound is mildly red and swollen. The dog does not appear to be
limping. Untreated wounds can lead to further medical complications and can cause unnecessary pain and distress
for the animal. The dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
