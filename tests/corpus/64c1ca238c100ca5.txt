2.31(d)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A review of the IACUC approved protocol, #08-03-16-19D showed that the method of euthanasia described does
not meet professionally accepted standards for humane euthanasia of non-human primates. The protocol describes
the euthanizing agent as pentobarbital, given IM. The registrant agrees that using pentobarbital via an IM route is
not a professionally accepted standard, but that the route of delivery had been overlooked during the PI preparation
and the IACUC review of the protocol. It is crucial that the IACUC carefully and diligently review all aspects of
animal use protocols to ensure that errors such as these are caught and corrected.
The IACUC must ensure, during its review and approval of activities involving animals that the proposed activities
are in accordance with 9 CFR part 1 and 2. If a deviation is required, an acceptable justification for departure must
be presented in writing, reviewed and approved.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
