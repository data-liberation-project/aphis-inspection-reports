2.1(a)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The facility is currently conducting regulated activity without a valid USDA license. This facility was previously
licensed with USDA. The facility failed to renew its USDA license and the license was canceled on 3/3/2015.
Documentation was obtained from a broker confirming that this facility wholesaled puppies to the broker on several
occasions; 4/30/2015 (1 puppy), 4/30/2015 (2 puppies), 4/22/2015 (3 puppies), 4/15/2015 (6 puppies) and 4/3/2015
(11 puppies). The facility owner stated that he had only missed the renewal date by 2 days and was not aware that
he was no longer able to sell to his broker without the license. He thought that he was able to sell to his broker as
long as he was in the licensing process. Although this facility is currently in the pre-licensing processes, they have
not obtained a new license and is unable to conduct regulated activity at this time. A valid USDA license is
necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and to comply with the Animal Welfare Act and
Regulations.

This facility must obtain a USDA license or discontinue regulated activities.

This must be corrected prior to any additional wholesale sales.

NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.

An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative and Animal Care Inspector Shannon Sebera.
