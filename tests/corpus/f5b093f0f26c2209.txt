WATERING.
The hard plastic water receptacle used for tiger, Princess, had heavy wearing with roughened edges and grooves
along the top with an accumulation of dirt and debris. Water receptacles with heavy wearing and grooves can trap
bacteria or other potentially harmful organisms and cannot be properly sanitized.
A system should be in place to ensure water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary as required or replaced as
needed for the health and well-being of the animals.
