HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of this inspection at least two litters of puppies that were purchased by this broker from other breeders
were housed in enclosures within a kennel building operated by another licensee. Housing of animals from two
separate businesses in the same building can increase disease transmission as well as make it difficult to correctly
identify which animals belong to what business. Housing facilities must be physically separated from any other
business. If a housing facility is located on the same premises as another business, it must be physically separated
from the other business. Correct by 30 Sept. 2015.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
