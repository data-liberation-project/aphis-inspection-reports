FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Attached to the large pasture is a smaller enclosure that contains feed bunks for the five elk and three deer. In this
area a section of the fencing has two broken fence posts that are leaning into the pasture area. The woven wire
fencing attached to the bottom of these two fence posts has become loose and has bent upward resulting in sharp
points that the animals could step on or become entangled in. Broken fence posts and damaged wire fencing could
cause injury to the animals and fail to contain the animals within the enclosure.
The enclosure must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals. The facility must repair or replace the damaged section of fencing. The facility must ensure
that enclosures housing the animals are always structurally sound and in good repair for the safety and well-being
of the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. There is a large opening in the fence for the five elk and three deer to move between the pastures. This opening is
completely covered by a large pool of water and the area around the water is extremely muddy. The animals must
cross the water and mud to access the different pastures.
West of the conservation building are two feed bunks for the five elk and one feed bunk for the three deer. The area
in front of each feed bunk has become excessively wet and muddy and there are multiple puddles of water in each
area. The animals must stand in the mud and water to access the feed that is provided in the bunks.

Walking across and standing in water and mud may cause the animals to become wet and soiled which could
negatively affect their health.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. The facility must establish a method for
quickly eliminating the standing pool of water in the opening between the pastures and the puddles of water in front
of the feed bunks. The facility must ensure that standing water is rapidly eliminated from all animal enclosures in
order to keep the animals clean and dry.

SANITATION.
The male elk has green netting from a bale of hay attached to his antlers and covering the front of his face. The
netting attached to the face of the elk could cause damage to the eyes, interfere with his field of vision, and affect
his ability to eat and drink.
The facility representative was given a verbal correction date of noon on March 19, 2016 to have the hay netting
removed from the male elk.
Within the pasture containing the five elk and three deer there are multiple sections of hay netting lying on the
ground within the enclosure. There are also five large round bales of hay that are stored in the enclosure which
have damage to their netting and some of the netting is hanging from the bales. The netting on the ground and
hanging from the bales of hay could cause the animals to become entangled in it.
In the same pasture there is a large metal fence panel that is lying on the ground and covered by tree branches.
During the inspection the elk were lying and standing around this piece of fencing. In a small pen that is only
accessible by the deer there is a large metal fence panel that is leaning against the primary fence. This metal panel
is not attached to the primary fence and some areas of it are bent and damaged. The animals could become
entangled in the metal fence panel that is on the ground or knock over the fence panel that is leaning on the primaryfence which could result in injury.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and facilitate husbandry
practices. Trash and unused materials shall be placed in appropriate areas and cleared from the animal enclosures
to protect the health of the animals. The facility must store the unused fence panels in an appropriate area away
from the animals and must remove the hay netting from within the enclosure in order to promote the health and
well-being of the animals.
