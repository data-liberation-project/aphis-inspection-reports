ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care was not available at the time of inspection. The facility had reached out last
week asking for a copy of the form and is in the process of replacing the form that is missing. Veterinary care and
visits to the facility were reviewed, but the written program of veterinary care should be available at the time of
inspection.
