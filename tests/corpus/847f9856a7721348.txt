3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
(b) At least 5 of the red self -feeders at the facility contained pieces of white, molded dry dog food. One of the
feeders had food that was caked together in the top half of the feeder. The licensee had cleaned and sanitized the
feeders since the last inspection. However, the feeders do not have lids and the licensee stated she is filling the
feeders with enough feed for 6 days. The metal container that the licensee uses for food storage is free from mold
and contaminated feed. Indicating that the food is not molding until it is placed in the feeders. Molded dog food and
unclean feeders have the potential to sicken dogs. The licensee shall ensure all of the food receptacles are
adequately and routinely cleaned and sanitized and that a lid or cover is used on top of the feeder to protect the
feed from moisture and contamination.
A focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee on June 30,2014. This inspection was
limited to both direct and indirect non-compliant items 2.40(b)(2), 3.1(c) (3) ,3.9 (b) and 3.11 (a) found during a
routine inspection on June 17,2014. The 12 animals itemized under 2.40(b)(2) have received adequate grooming
and treatment for skin conditions. The licensee cleaned the indoor enclosures and the outdoor enclosures were free
from dried feces (previously identifed under 3.1(c)(3) and 3.11(a)).
