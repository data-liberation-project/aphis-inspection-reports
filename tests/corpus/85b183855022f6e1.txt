3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces--(1) General requirements. (i)
Several surfaces throughout the sheltered facility were excessively rusted.
***There were two rusted support structures that were hanging under the outdoor portion of enclosures. These
support structures had each been supporting the wire flooring under and between two enclosures. Approximately
half of one of the rusted support structures and the majority of the other support structure were disconnected near
the back walls and hanging from under the enclosures. When the dogs walked on the flooring a small gap could
occasionally be visualized between the back wall and flooring. Also, there were portions of broken rusted wires in
the 1x1 inch flooring in one of these enclosures. The broken wires created larger holes in the wire flooring which
were big enough for a foot of one or both of the Yorkshire Terriers, housed in the enclosure, to have a foot pass
through. The holes in the flooring and the rusted support structures under the enclosures increase the risk of injury
to the dogs. TO BE CORRECTED BY: November 24, 2014.
***The solid walls on the backs of the outdoor portion, inside and under the enclosures, of the facility were
excessively rusted. There were holes visible in some of the areas of rust on the wall under the primary enclosures.
Rust was also present around/near the in/out doors inside of the outdoor portion of the enclosures. Excessive rust
can decrease structural strength and can prevent the required cleaning and sanitization which can increase the risk
of disease hazards. TO BE CORRECTED BY: February 17, 2015.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are kept free of excess rust that prevents the
required cleaning and sanitization or that affects the structural strength of the surface.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces (3) Cleaning.
***Some of the primary enclosures in the sheltered building, housing adult dogs and puppies, had a build up of dirt,
grime and/or hair on the outdoor portion and/or indoor portion of the facility. On the outdoor portion, most of theprimary enclosures had an accumulation of hair and/or feces hanging from the flooring of the enclosures. Also, the
solid walls under the primary enclosures on both sides of the outside of the building had a build up of dirt, cobwebs
and rust them. The in/out doors for many of the enclosures had a build up of dirt and grime on them.
Accumulations of dirt, grime and hair can increase the risk of disease hazards which could affect the health and
well-being of dogs. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of the housing facility are cleaned and sanitized as
necessary in order to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices and to reduce disease hazards.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: December 1, 2014.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f) Drainage and waste disposal.
***Inside the sheltered facility, there was a plastic barrel full of hair clippings and other trash materials that was
uncovered. Hair clippings and trash can attract pest and vermin which increase the risk of disease to the animals.
The licensee must ensure that all items of trash within housing facilities are kept in leakproof containers with tightly
fitted lids on them at all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: November 24, 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
