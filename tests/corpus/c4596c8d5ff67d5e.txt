2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently the puppy records do not have the female information included, or a puppy number system that allows the
puppies to be traced back to a specific female. The same numbers are used 1-15 for all puppies born to all females
which makes it difficult to tell who had what puppy. There are 3 dogs missing on the Acquisition 7005 form of the
inventory.
Complete and accurate records must be kept for the proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
The licensee must have puppy numbers assigned to each puppy that can be traced to the mother of the litter. All
Acquisition 7005 and Disposition 7006 records shall be filled out completely and updated with all animals sold or
added
to the inventory.
