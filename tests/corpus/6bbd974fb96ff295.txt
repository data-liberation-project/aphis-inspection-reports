3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is one outdoor enclosure on the north side of the facility housing two dogs with a large hole under the divider
fence that leaves a gap between the fence and the ground. This hole appears large enough for a dog to insert its
head under the fence. There is also a hole in the dirt under the egress door on the south side of the whelping
building leaving a gap under the building. Holes under fences and structures can cause injury to dogs who try to
crawl in the space between the fence and the ground. Holes under fences can also allow dogs to escape the
enclosure or other animals to gain access to the enclosure.
***
There is a shredded tarp hanging into an enclosure on the south side of the property housing two dogs. The tarp is
shredded on the edges and is within reach of the dogs. There are pieces of the tarp on the ground of the enclosure.
The dogs could chew on the tarp leading to injury and intestinal upset.
***
The licensee must maintain the facility in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals
securely.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is an outdoor enclosure on the east side of the facility housing three Labrador retrievers that has insufficient
shade. Lack of shade can be uncomfortable for the dogs and in some conditions, cause inability to regulate body
temperature. The licensee must provide areas of shade that are large enough to contain all the animals at one timeand protect them from the direct rays of the sun. This shade must be in addition to shelter structures in the
enclosure. To be corrected by 18 March 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is a section of a sheet of metal that is ripped and turned inward into an enclosure on the north side of the
facility. The resulting metal edge was ragged and appeared sharp. The was in the second enclosure from the west
and housed two dogs. There are also multiple protruding screw heads and a small protruding metal edge on the
wall of an enclosure housing a Labrador retriever and her puppies. Sharp metal edges or points can cause injury to
the dogs. The licensee must maintain all primary enclosures so that they have no sharp points or edges that could
injure the dogs.
