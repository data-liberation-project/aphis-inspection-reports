**** There is a Bull mastiff male named "Rambo" microchip number 491000013320777, that during the inspection I
observed a swollen right front paw and when he moved would put very little weight on it. Asked licensee to pull the
dog out to get a closer look. I could see on bottom of the paw on the pad a section of the pad is missing. This area
appears to be inflamed by the swelling and tender because the dog not wanting to put weight on the paw. This
injury has caused the dog to alter his walking gait and leads to joint alignment issues. While inside looking through
the paperwork the licensee called his attending veterinarian to schedule the appointment for today. The dog must
be seen by your attending veterinarian and be treated for the health issue.

**** Three pens have excessive rust on the metal surfaces, in some areas it has pitted the metal and other areas
the metal pipe section has rusted out creating jagged rusted edges. The rusted surfaces hinder the ability to clean
and sanitize properly. The excessive rust also compromises the structural strength of the enclosures. All surfaces
must be maintained on a regular basis to be free of excessive rust.
