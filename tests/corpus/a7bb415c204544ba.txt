FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Inside the African Lions indoor housing, in the second enclosure on the left, on the back wall are multiple area
where the paint is peeling off the back wall. The areas measures approximately 5(cid:29)" X 4(cid:29)" and 8(cid:29)" x 3(cid:29)". Peeling paint
creates a difficult environment to sanitize properly, allowing for microorganism to grow in addition posing the
possibility of ingestion. A program of maintance must be utilized to identify and correct this noncompliance in a
timely manner, to insure a safe enclosure for the animals and that this noncompliance does not repeat.
-Due to the potential birth in this enclosure and the season, a six month correction has been given.
