HOUSEKEEPING - THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE STILL IN NEED OF CLEANING, REMOVAL, REPAIR,
AND/OR REPLACEMENT:
1. One refrigerator, which is utilized for storing food items for the animals, again has accumulations of spilled liquids
and food. Spilled items leave the refrigerator in an unsanitary condition. Refrigerators must be cleaned and
sanitized to prevent food borne illnesses and to ensure that uncontaminated food is provided to the animals for their
health and well-being.
2. The linoleum floor, in the room holding two pigs and sugar gliders, remains torn in several locations.
Fecal material and other debris can accumulate in these damaged areas. The damaged linoleum and missing tiles
must be removed, repaired or replaced to keep the floors in good repair in order to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representatives.
