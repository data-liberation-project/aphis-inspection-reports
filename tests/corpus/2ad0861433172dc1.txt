RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were no records of guinea pig births at the facility. Dealers must maintain records on animals purchased,
acquired, sold, transported, held, died, euthanized, offspring born, or otherwise disposed of by the dealer. Records
must be kept and maintained on animal births to help keep track of animals, and to assess the facility animal care
program. Correct by July 25, 2019.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Enclosures had accumulations of feces and dirty/wet bedding. Too much feces and dirty/wet bedding is
accumulating between the cleaning interval. The accumulation of feces and dirty bedding exposes the guinea pigs
to potential infections with bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are cleaned
and sanitized often enough to prevent accumulation of feces and dirty/wet bedding. In addition, the enclosures must
be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by July 23, 2019.
