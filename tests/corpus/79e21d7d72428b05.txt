SANITATION.
The indoor wire enclosure housing the 2 prairie dogs during the time when it is too hot to be outside, has a sliding
waste pan to catch any feces and urine. The sliding waste pan is filled with fecal matter and urine soaked
newspaper. The facility representative stated that the cage is only cleaned once a week.
Excreta should be removed from primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. It is necessary to maintain a clean
enclosure and remove and replace newspaper when they are soiled and stained to prevent odor and reduce the risk
of disease to the animals.
