Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A superficial wound approximately 1 cm x 2 cm on one Prevost squirrel's tail was observed during inspection. This animal
had recently returned from the AV’s hospital, where its’ tail had been amputated due to apparent ongoing self-trauma.
This is one of two Prevosts who have undergone tail amputation surgery due to self-trauma. The other Prevost whose tail
had been amputated appeared to be in good health. The two additional Prevosts had normal hair and normal-appearing
tails. The AV had not been made aware of the tail wound until after the inspector noted the wound during inspection.


The three wolves on the premises each have open wounds and thick crusty scabbing along the tips of their ears. These
wounds appear consistent with chronic fly strike. An employee at the facility stated that staff flysprays the ears of the two
more compliant wolves almost daily with and applies SWAT ointment about once a week. One wolf cannot be handled
without sedation so receives more limited care. The wolves were not under the medical care of the AV and no medical
treatment for the wounds had been prescribed at the time of inspection. The AV had not been notified about the severity
of the flystrike wounds on these three animals at the time of inspection.




Unresolved self-trauma and ongoing flystrike can result in significant distress and discomfort for the animals. Per the
regulations, each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: Daily
observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being; Provided, however, That daily observation of animals may
be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior,
and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

Sanitation.
Multiple rats were noted to be actively feeding from the fresh produce bowl in the cavy/chicken enclosure in the upper
barn. The licensee indicated that they do have a pest control program in place, and traps were visible. However, the
current program is inadequate for controlling the rat population. Per the regulations, a safe and effective program for the
control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
