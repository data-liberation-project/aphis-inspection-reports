FEEDING.
Pelleted food for the animals is being stored in a covered container in a small room with no roof. Two gasoline
engine leaf blowers were being stored directly above the food container. A variety of cleaning items including mops
and buckets were also being stored in the room. The food contained clumps of pellets. Food stored in such a
manner may be exposed to rain, heat from the sun, and chemicals such as motor oil and gasoline and their vapors.
Food should be stored in such a manner that it is kept wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination.
Consuming food that has become degraded by exposure to the elements, or contaminated with chemicals, may be
detrimental to the health of the animals.
