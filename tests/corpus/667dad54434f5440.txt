Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 AM and 1:45
PM on July 26, 2022.

Spoke with a relative in the morning who stated I just missed the licensee. The relative stated she didn't know how long
the licensee would be gone. I called and left a message on the licensees cell phone.
Returned to the facility at 1:45 PM. No one answered the door, or responded when the inspector yelled hello out back.
Another message was left on the licensees cell phone. Waited 30 minutes for and left the facility.
