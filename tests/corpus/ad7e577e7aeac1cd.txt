INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The guinea pig protocol describes the names and dosages of sedatives to be administered during animal use but
does not contain enough information to determine when the sedation is to be administered. The sedative narrative
refers to exsanguination, however, facility personnel stated during this inspection that guinea pigs are not
exsanguinated under this protocol.
All protocols to conduct activities involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the
animals so that it may be clearly determined that the activities are in accordance with the requirements and
standards as described under the Animal Welfare Act. The protocol should contain clarifying information regarding
the administration of sedatives. Correct by: December 4, 2017.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC chair and IO.
