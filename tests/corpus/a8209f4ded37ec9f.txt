FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The primary enclosure fence for the sheep currently held in quarantine is not structurally sound. A tree fell on the
perimeter fence as well as the enclosure fence destroying the fence sections. Damage to the fences may allow the
animals to escape their enclosure or allow unwanted animals in. The fence shall be repaired to protect the sheep
and hold them securely within their enclosure. Correct by September 10, 2018;
***There is another section of fence that was damaged by a tree in the corner on the right side of the gate near the
dumpster. The large pigs are allowed access to this section to allow them access to additional shade. The fence is
no longer structurally sound and may allow the pigs to leave their enclosure. The fence shall be repaired to
maintain the pigs securely within their enclosure and prevent access from unwanted animals. Correct by
September 10, 2018.
***I observed a goat jump on a raised stand that was leaning and wobbly. The stand wobbled enough that the goat
jumped off. The legs of the stand were becoming detached which would allow the stand to fall and possibly cause
the goats to become injured. The stand shall be removed, repaired, or replaced to protect the goats from injury.
