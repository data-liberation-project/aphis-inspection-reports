2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female Boston Terrier (m/c# OAO2164504) had excessively long toenails, which were causing the digits to
twist to the side when she stood on a solid surface. Excessively long toenails can be painful and can affect the gait
of the dog. The licensee must ensure that toenails are trimmed to a comfortable length.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
An empty primary enclosure had an accumulation of old, moldy dog food on the floor. The licensee didn't know how
long it had been since this enclosure had been cleaned and sanitized. The building had a strong moldy odor and
the lactating female in the adjacent enclosure was coughing. Moldy food can cause odors and harbor pests that
can carry diseases that can affect the health of the dogs. The licensee must clean and sanitize all surfaces in
housing facilities when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.

3.3(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The licensee had opened the door to a building previously used as a sheltered building to allow the 3 Australian
Shepherds within free access to a fenced pen outside. The air conditioner had been turned off and the temperature
inside the building was 93.1 degrees F. Excessive ambient temperatures cause discomfort and can result in
overheating that can lead to serious health conditions in dogs .
Sheltered buildings must be sufficiently cooled to protect the dogs from temperature extremes and the temperature
may not rise above 85 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive hours.

WATERING.
The licensee was using plastic swimming pools for the dogs to use for drinking and to cool themselves. Three
plastic swimming pools and one rubber container, being used for drinking water by a total of 8 dogs, had green
algae or dirt in them, which can affect the potability of the water and create disease hazards. The licensee must
ensure that water receptacles are cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt,
algae, and other disease hazards.

The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and an Animal Health Officer with the MO
Dept. of Agriculture.
