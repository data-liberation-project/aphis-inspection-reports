3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Excessive rust was observed on one galvanized metal gate frame. Two dogs are in contact with the affected
surface area located in outdoor housing. The affected surface was rough and jagged in appearance. Rust can
erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces to the point that the metal surfaces can no longer be readily cleaned and
sanitized. Excessive rust affects the structural integrity or strength of all metal surfaces. Surfaces that come in
contact with dogs must be free of excessive rust. Failure to adequately clean and sanitize any surface that is rough
or rusted could play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces be free of excessive
rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitation or affects the structural strength of the surface. Correct by
5/30/19.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* An estimated 20 ft. section of eight ft. high woven wire fencing is bent in half. One camel is in contact with the

animal. In addition, this could also lead to potential injury to the animal creating a negative impact on the animal.
The licensee must ensure that outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. Correct by 5/23/19.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 5/16/19 were conducted with the licensee.
