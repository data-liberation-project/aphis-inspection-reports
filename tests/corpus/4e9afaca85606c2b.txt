FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A rabbit hutch currently being used to house the two rabbits is not structurally sound and maintained in good repair.
-There are several areas of sharp, pointed wire mesh ends and an approximately 3 inches wide by 12 inches long
opening or gap at the back part of the hutch.
- There is an area of wire meshing with sharp, pointed ends near a water bowl in the front part of the enclosure
which is not fastened to the underlying wood support beams.
Failure to maintain primary enclosures in good repair can lead to injury to rabbits, including falling through floors,
puncture wounds from wires, and trapping limbs in openings or gaps. A system of timely maintenance and repair of
facilities must be in place to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of
other animals.

WATERING.
A water bowl inside the rabbit enclosure had a moderate accumulation of brown organic material along its sides and
bottom. Also, a water bottle hanging on the small, wire exercise pen for the rabbits contained a heavy, buildup of
brownish-green organic material on the inside walls.
All watering receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty, and at least once every 2 weeks to ensure the health and
well-being of the animals. A system should be in place to ensure all water receptacles for all animals are cleaned
as often as necessary to be in compliance with the Act.

SANITATION.
There were two empty rabbit enclosures which contained an accumulation of dried feces, straw material, cobwebs,
dirt, and debris. These empty enclosures were located directly adjacent to the enclosure currently being used by
the two rabbits.
Decomposing organic/waste material may create noxious odors, attract pests, and potentially create disease
hazards thus adversely impacting the health and well-being of the animals housed nearby. Premises (buildings and
grounds) shall be kept clean in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
A system should be in place to ensure areas surrounding animal housing areas are cleaned as required to protect
the health and well-being of the animals.
