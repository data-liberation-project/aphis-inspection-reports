FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Excessive rust and large areas of missing paint and paint chipping were observed at multiple areas on the
floating/walking platform located in the main dolphin show pool (this platform constitutes the western section of the
enclosure). Outdoor housing facilities for marine mammals must be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from ingesting contaminants, physical injury and potential health problems. All surfaces in a primary
enclosure must be maintained in good repair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program. The affected
areas observed should be repaired/maintained as soon as possible ensuring the dolphins are protected from
contaminants and debris while being corrected.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
All natural seawater pools at the facility were observed to have minimal or no shade for resident dolphins. Minimal
shade for the comfort of the animals was provided by naturally growing mangroves. A 32 year old Atlantic
bottlenose dolphin named "Stormy" was observed in his pool with sunscreen (zinc oxide) ointment applied on his
head for sunlight protection and to prevent sunburn. The shade provided to "Stormy" by the small mangroves in his
enclosure is inadequate. In order for "Stormy" to get away from the sun, he must seek shade by the small
mangroves shallows and remain virtually motionless.
Additionally, the tarp material providing shade over the main California sea lion pool and enclosures was torn/ripped
in several areas, creating a safety hazard for both animals and the public. This is due to deteriorating shade cloth
and the possibility of it falling into the pool, and potentially entangling animals or allowing ingestion of the material.
Local climatic conditions need to be taken into consideration when providing shelter and shade for all marine
mammals kept outdoors. Appropriate shelter/shade needs to be provided to all marine mammals in order to protect
them from the weather and from direct sunlight.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility's perimeter fence was found in need of repair along most of the northeast portions. There were several
gaps and one large hole measuring approximately 12" x 24" inches under the fence. Two chain links gates that are
part of the perimeter fence of the facility are damaged. One gate has a significant gap between the fence and gate
that is large enough for unwanted animals or persons to pass through. The plastic fencing placed on top of
extension arms was found to be damaged and bent along most of the perimeter fence and broken cable ties holding
the plastic fencing to the chain link were found on the ground and hanging from the fence. Vegetation and small
trees were observed growing within and above the chain-linked fence's foundation, compromising the integrity of the
fence. Facilities must be enclosed by a sound perimeter fence so that it protects marine mammals by restricting
animals and unauthorized persons from going through it, over it, or under it and having contact with the marine
mammals, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility when
appropriate.

SANITATION.
A multitude of different objects (to include boats, trailers, construction equipment, building materials, cages, and
others) were observed scattered throughout the facility grounds, mostly in non-exhibit areas, but in very close
proximity to the perimeter fence. Housekeeping at the facility is paramount and needs to be performed to prevent
potential infestations by pests/vermin and to ensure debris doesn't enter into the animal exhibits. Buildings and
grounds, as well as exhibit areas, must be kept clean and in good repair.
