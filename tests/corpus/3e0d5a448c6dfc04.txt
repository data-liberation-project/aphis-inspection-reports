2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* Billie Bob, a male Yorkshire Terrier, (DOB 09-13-2013 ID #30), was observed to have a large amount of thick,
dark brown organic material covering the majority of upper cheek and canine teeth. This buildup of organic material
obscured individual tooth identification and the gum line is receded and red.
**Bear, a male Yorkshire Terrier (DOB 12-07-2010 ID #20), was reluctant to open his mouth. He has a thick, dark
brown organic material covering the majority of the upper cheek and canine teeth. The receding gum tissue was of
a deep red color.
Excessive tartar buildup on teeth and other indications of dental disease such as reddened or receding gums may
lead to discomfort, difficulty chewing and/or other health issues. These two dogs were to have been seen by a
veterinarian no later than 12/31/17 to obtain a diagnosis and treatment plan. Licensee must ensure that these two
dogs are evaluated by a veterinarian and a dental treatment plan is established and maintained to minimize
discomfort, pain and prevent other health issues. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be available for review
upon request of the inspector.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
Additional topics of discussion included a compliance visit and medical documentation.
