ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The licensee obtained a black bear cub and began exhibiting the animal prior to updating the Program of
Veterinary Care (PVC). The licensee had not maintained bears in the past. Therefore, the PVC did not document
an appropriate preventive medical program for the bear, including but not limited to: appropriate quarantine,
vaccinations, diagnostic testing, zoonotic disease prevention measures, and special dietary needs. The bear was
confiscated by local officials after it bit multiple students at a petting zoo and is no longer present at the facility.
** It is important to address the specific, unique medical concerns of bears (and all species) in a PVC in order to
prevent veterinary and public health problems.
*** The licensee must ensure that the PVC is updated each time a new species is obtained.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
* The licensee obtained a three-month-old black bear cub without having adequate experience about how to care
for the species. The licensee also didn't have important knowledge about that individual bear, like its medical
history. When asked if she had any training on bears, the licensee stated "no" and said her only experience with
bears was volunteering to help feed infant bears for a few days many years ago at an exotic animal auction. The
licensee stated she originally had no intention of exhibiting the bear and was only planning to care for it temporarily
as a favor to the bear's owner. She fed the bear what the owner recommended (Esbilac puppy formula, grapes,
banana, and sweet potato) but failed to consult with her Attending Veterinarian or an equivalent professional with
bear expertise to determine if that diet was appropriate for the infant bear. Less than two weeks after acquiring the
bear, without knowing its medical history or seeing its health certificate, the licensee exhibited the animal at a
petting zoo. The bear was handled by numerous students and eventually had to be confiscated by local officials
because it broke skin on 19 students and its rabies status was unknown. The bear almost had to be euthanized but
was spared when public officials determined by viewing it's entire life history (which was not known by the licensee)that it was very improbable the animal had rabies.
** Bears and other potentially dangerous animals require special care, diets, and handling, especially at a young
age. Numerous health, welfare, and safety issues could arise if bears are maintained by perosnnel with inadequate
knowledge and experience.
*** The licensee must be able to demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of all wild or exotic animals
maintained.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
* In late April, the licensee brought a three-month-old black bear cub to a petting zoo on a university campus. The
bear was handled by numerous students and 19 of those students had their skin broken when the cub bit and/or
scratched them. The bear was not vaccinated for rabies and its rabies status was unknown. Public health officials
confiscated the bear cub several days after the petting zoo episode and it almost had to be euthanized to determine
if it was rabies positive. Many of the students began post-exposure prophylactic shots based on the direction of
public health officials and medical professionals. The bear's life was only spared from euthanasia after government
officials determined by reviewing the bear's entire life/medical hisory that it was highly improbable the bear was
rabid. The licensee was unaware of the animal's full life/medical history and therefore could not know that the
animal was free from rabies prior to exhibiting it.
** Allowing a bear cub to be handled in a petting zoo when its rabies status is unknown, could result in possible
rabies exposure, painful shot treatments, and/or death of both the animal and humans.
*** The licensee must ensure that all animals at the petting zoo are handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the
animal and to the public.

This was a focused inspection only concentrating on the black bear cub which was no longer present at the facility
on the date of the inspection. The inspection and an exit interview were conducted with the licensee on 17 July
2014. A second verbal exit interview was conducted with the licensee via telephone on 28 July 2014.
