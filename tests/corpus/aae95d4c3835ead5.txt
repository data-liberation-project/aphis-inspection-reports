Barney, an approximately 2 year old male cinnamon black bear, was observed with large patches of hair loss
around his neck, face, and halfway down both the right and left sides of his body. During this inspection Barney
was also observed scratching himself in the areas of hair loss.
USDA inspection dated January 30, 2015, indicated Barney(cid:25)s condition existed over essentially the same areas of
the body. The inspection of January 30, 2015 also stated the attending veterinarian was contacted and the
condition was treated back in November 2014. It was also stated the patches of hair loss were much smaller at that
time.
Mr. Steele produced a document dated February 11, 2015 showing Barney had been seen and evaluated by his
veterinarian. The veterinarian performed a skin scrape and prescribed shampoo and omega 3 fatty acid
supplementation.
Although documentation indicates Barney(cid:25)s hair loss problem was seen by a veterinarian, it continues to be an
ongoing or reoccuring problem since at least November 2014. Hair loss can be an indication of an underlying
medical condition which may include parasites, allergies or some other disease process. Hair loss and associated
scratching indicates Barney is experiencing skin irritation and discomfort.
Barney(cid:25)s hair loss needs to be addressed again by the attending veterinarian and diagnostics run to determine the
underlying cause and a treatment regime started to correct this condition.
