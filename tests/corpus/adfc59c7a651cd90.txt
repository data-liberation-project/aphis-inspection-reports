FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The east side of the perimeter fence at the facility is in disrepair. The east fence, comprised of six foot tall woven
wire, is sagging down from the top in several areas. The sagging has resulted in the fence being approximately four
to five feet in height in these areas. The fence must be kept in good repair as it acts as a secondary containment
system for the animals.
Repair or replace the affected areas of the perimeter fence.
