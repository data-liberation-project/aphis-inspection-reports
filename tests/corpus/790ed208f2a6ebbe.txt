2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male grey and tan Yorkie (microchip number 096-849-356) has a heavily matted right eye. The fur around
the eye is covered in a black crusty matter to such an extent that it is difficult to visualize the eye. A moist and
greenish colored discharge is also present covering the entire surface of the eye.
An adult male black and white Boston terrier with no official identification has an abnormal right eye. The eye has a
protruding "bubble-like" bulge covering the entire area of the pupil and iris. The interior of the eye is cloudy and
blue-grey in color. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection and trauma and can be
painful. The dogs must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and an appropriate treatment plan administered.
Documentation should be made available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment
plan must be part of this documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care
at all times.

2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The black and white male Boston terrier with the abnormal right eye does not have an official form of identification.
Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the
inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are officially identified by collar, tattoo or microchip.

2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Official dogs on hand sheets (7005's) have 3 Siberian huskies recorded but there were 18 adult huskies counted by
the inspector. When the records and the dogs at the facility don't match it makes the records incomplete. Complete
and accurate records are needed to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the
ability to trace dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all times at theirfacility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Condition and site.
The area in the three sided shelter used to store feed had a pile of empty feed sacks on the floor. This can attract
pests and provide a place for rodents to nest and breed. The empty feed sacks need to be removed from the facility
and disposed of properly to reduce nesting areas for rodents and to demonstrate proper husbandry practices. All
housing facilities and areas used for storing animal food and bedding must be free of accumulations of trash and
discarded materials.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces.
There is a metal self-feeder in the enclosure containing a white French bulldog that is rusted on the bottom portion.
The rust is pitting and flaking on the surface of the feeder. Rusted surfaces cannot be sanitized properly and can
lead to disease hazards for the dogs. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing
facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility--that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Within the three sided shelter is a primary enclosure containing a white French bulldog. There is an accumulation of
cobwebs inside the enclosure along the top corner against the wall. There is also a layer of dust and dirt on the
surfaces of the enclosure. Not cleaning and sanitizing the enclosures on a regular basis can lead to disease
hazards for the dogs. Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized
at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste,
excreta, and other disease hazards.
