2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care is incomplete in that it does not provide enough details, and during this
inspection, the dog part of the program could not be found. Each section needs to be more complete with details of
medications provided for parasite control including drug names and dosages. If products are used off label, this has
to be approved by the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian needs to state how often he is to visit the
facility and what vet care needs to be provided for these animals to ensure an appropriate vet care plan is being
provided and followed.
2.50(c) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are currently 9 wolf/wolf hybrids at this traveling exhibit. Although all of the animals are microchipped, the
reader is not available, and no variance to use microchipping was obtained. Some of the animals have photo
identification, but there are no tags on the cages or with the photo identification. If the microchip method is going to
be used as official identification, a reader has to be available and a variance obtained. As an alternative, photo
identification along with all the required acquisition information and an official tag can be used.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee. Inspection conducted at Coastal Fair, Ladson, SC.
