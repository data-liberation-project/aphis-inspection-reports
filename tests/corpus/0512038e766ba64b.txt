3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
Extra supplies of dog food are currently stored on the floor and against the wall in the “picture room” and “quarantine
room”. Cleaning cannot be properly done under and around the supplies not allowing for adequate protection against
contamination or vermin infestation. All supplies of food must be stored off the floor and away from wall to prevent
contamination or infestation and to facilitate effective cleaning measures.
3.2(b)

Indoor housing facilities.
Upon entering the air conditioned rooms A and B used to house puppies, a strong ammonia odor was detected. The odor
was strongest in room B but was easily detected in both rooms by the inspector even while wearing a N95 mask that
decreases odor perception. The odor started to dissipate once the doors to the rooms were opened. Ammonia inhalation
can be detrimental to animal health, especially the respiratory systems of dogs housed indoors. The licensee must keep
the housing facilities sufficiently ventilated for the health and well-being of the dogs by minimizing odors, drafts, ammonia
levels, and moisture condensation.
3.8

Exercise for dogs.


The dog exercise program was not documented fully and was not approved by the attending veterinarian. An exercise
plan ensures that all animals are receiving an adequate opportunity for exercise and physical movement. The applicant
must develop an exercise plan with the attending veterinarian that documents the frequency, method, and duration of
exercise for each dog.
