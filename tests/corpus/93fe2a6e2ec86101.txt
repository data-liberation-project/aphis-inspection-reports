2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Three hedgehogs are currently undergoing treatment without authorization from the attending veterinarian. The licensee
noticed increased respiratory sounds and began the hedgehogs on a course of oral by antibiotics. Although the antibiotics
used were recently prescribed by a local veterinarian, the prescription and dosing were written for a different species at
the facility. With the recent retirement of their past attending vet, the licensee stated they were in the interim of finding a
new veterinarian, resulting in the use of antibiotics on hand at the facility.

Medications used on animals that were not appropriated dosed, or specifically prescribed for its condition, are not safe or
appropriate methods since unexpected results may be yielded. This could result in the animals experiencing side effects
or unrelieved symptoms due to incorrect administration.

The licensee must ensure that all animals showing signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a timely manner
a veterinarian as part of the facility’s program of veterinary care; and that the facility uses appropriate methods to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries at all times.
