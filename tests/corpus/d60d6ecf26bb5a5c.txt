MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling. In January 2014 a husbandry technician transferred 2 of 3 rabbits from their enclosures to clean
enclosures but failed to transfer the third rabbit prior to the enclosures sanitation in a rack washer resulting in the
animal's death. The facility corrected this incident by developing measures to prevent recurrence including ongoing
training, a new procedure of removing and inverting bottom enclosures, and assigning 2 staff members to confirm
the cages are empty before sanitation.
This incident has been addressed by the facility.
The inspection was conducted on 23, 24th June 2014 and an exit briefing with the Assistant Director on June 24
2014.
