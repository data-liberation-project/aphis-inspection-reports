Sanitation.
Enclosures numbered 27, 28, 29, 30 and 71 housing a total of 23 adult guinea pigs and 4 offspring had wet bedding/moist
pad by the automatic water valves. Wet bedding can cause discomfort to the animals and can expose the guinea pigs to
potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal and parasites. Correct by ensuing that enclosures are kept clean and
sanitized often enough to prevent wet and soiled bedding. In addition, primary enclosures must be sanitized at last once
every 2 weeks. Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
