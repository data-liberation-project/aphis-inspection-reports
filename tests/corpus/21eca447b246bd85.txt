***There was a pig in an outdoor enclosure that had an approximately 3-4 inch laceration behind the front right leg.
Additionally the animal had several swollen mammary glands on its left side. The licensee stated that this animal
currently has mastitis. This animal is currently not being treated and the attending veterinarian has not been
contacted. Injuries that are not treated maybe painful and can lead to prolonged suffering, infection, and other
veterinary care health problems.
***One pig in the finishing house had a very thin body condition as evidenced by visible ribs as compared to litter
mates. The animal appeared to be lethargic and reluctant to move compared to its litter mates. The licensee stated
that he had been treating the animal for three weeks with no change in condition. He stated that he had not
contacted the attending veterinarian regarding this animal. Thin body condition can signify inadequate nutrition or
other underlying disease or pain.
The licensee must have these animals evaluated by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on June 26, 2015, to obtain accurate
diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be
provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic
tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with
the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the
medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.3.125(a)

structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals by falling through the hole or a leg entrapment. All
structures must be maintained and kept structurally sound. The affected structures must be repaired or replaced.

***The enclosure housing 15 adult pigs did not have adequate shade to protect all of the animals from direct
sunlight. The shade structure was approximately 10' x 10' and was not adequate size for all the animals to be in the
shade at the same time.
***In another enclosure housing 24 pigs did not have an adequate area for shade. The provided shade area was
approximately 3-6 inches deep in mud. There was no area of shade provided in which the animals could remain dry.
