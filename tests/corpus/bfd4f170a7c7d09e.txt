PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors, walls and doors on the outside portion of the primary enclosures were moderately worn. The primary
enclosures in this area are constructed of primarily of coated wire. The wire coating has been worn or chewed off
over portions of the floors, walls and doors. In the majority of these areas the exposed wire is rusted. These areas
of the kennel are no longer in good repair. The areas where the coating is damaged provide crevices that organic
material can become entrapped preventing adequate cleaning and sanitation. Additionally, the rust which has
formed over the exposed wires also prevents them from being readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by repairing or
replacing these damaged areas. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be readily cleaned and sanitized in
accordance with Sec. 3.11 (b) of this subpart, or be replaceable when worn or soiled.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
During the inspection it was noted that the wash-down areas had a heavy buildup of tan matter. There was a
moderate amount of feces and urine present within the wash down area. This buildup is an indicator of dried urine
and feces that has built up over time. Improper cleaning and sanitization of the wash down contributes to the odor
and disease hazards within the facility. This facility must establish and maintain a routine for proper cleaning and
sanitation for the facility to include all wash downs.
