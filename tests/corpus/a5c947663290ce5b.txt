2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Program of Veterinary Care was not available for review at the time of this inspection. Licensees' with part time
attending veterinarians must have a formal written arrangement with a veterinarian (PVC) that addresses the
preventive care for all regulated species. This is required so that USDA personnel can confirm that the licensee is
working with a veterinarian and is following the recommendations from that veterinarian.
A program of veterinary care needs to be developed for this facility by the attending veterinarian that includes
recommendations for all regulated species at the facility. Examples of some of the topics to be covered in the PVC
are:
*The veterinarian's schedule for visits to the facility.
*Parasite control program if appropriate for the species.
*Vaccination recommendations if appropriate for the species.
*Routine medical testing if appropriate for the species.
*Instructions on necropsies for unexpected deaths.
*Any other medical/husbandry recommendations the veterinarian feels necessary for this facility.
*Emergency contact information.
The PVC must be signed and dated by the attending veterinarian. This document must indicate to USDA
representatives that the licensee and the veterinarian have an active working relationship.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensees must ensure that the attending veterinarian has adequate authority to provide appropriate veterinary
care. One of the resident bobcats at this facility has had a chronic ear infection for years. The attendingveterinarian has repeatedly recommended a procedure to correct this infection. The licensee has refused to allow
this procedure due to the expense.
The attending veterinarian must be able to use appropriate methods to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases and
injuries regardless of expense. If expense is an issue the licensee should reevaluate their ability to adequately care
for the animal and possibly rehome the animal.
The bobcat with the chronic ear infection needs to be evaluated and appropriately treated by the attending
veterinarian immediately.

EMPLOYEES.
This facility has a high turnover rate of supervisors with animal care experience. When these turnovers occur there
are extended periods of time where there is no knowledgeable full time employee overseeing the facility and the
animals. Records on animal health and husbandry are sparse making it difficult for intermittent employees to
provide consistent acceptable levels of care for the animals.
The intermittent supervisor at the time of this inspection was unaware of the bobcat(cid:25)s chronic ear problem. This
facility needs to establish a better method for transitioning between supervisors and ensure that animal welfare
does not suffer when these transitions occur.
