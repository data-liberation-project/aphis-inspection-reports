Handling of animals.
On October 11, 2022, a rabbit in a floor-housing enclosure was injured when it’s left rear foot was caught in the hinge side
of the enclosure door as the animal care technician was leaving the enclosure and closing the door behind her. The
technician immediately opened the door and called veterinary staff to examine the rabbit. The rabbit had sustained
multiple open fractures of a digit. Due to the nature of injuries and the questionable ability of the rabbit to be used in
future study, the decision was made to euthanize the rabbit. Handling of all animals, including care during interacting with
pen or floor housed animals, needs to be done as carefully as possible and in a manner that does not cause trauma or
physical harm.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.
