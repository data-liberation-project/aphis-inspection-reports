3.110(b)
VETERINARY CARE.
Two male California Sea Lions were acquired approx. 4 months ago. At the present time they are housed
individually, and are not being continually housed in pools that have the minimum required MHD, depth, and surface
area. Only a tub of water measuring 6' L x 5' W x 2' deep is provided in each enclosure. Additionally, the dry
resting area does not provide sufficient amount of space when they are confined to their primary enclosures. These
animals are only allowed access to compliant pools of water and dry resting area(s) for limited times during the
day/night.
The attending veterinarian has not provided a written justification as to why these animals cannot be afforded a
compliant MHD, pool of water, and dry resting area.
Marine mammals that are isolated or separated for nonmedical purposes must be held in facilities that meet
minimum space requirements as outlined in Sec. 3.104. Holding facilities used only for medical treatment and
medical training need not meet the minimum space requirements as outlined in Sec. 3.104. Holding of a marine
mammal in a medical treatment or medical training enclosure that does not meet minimum space requirements for
periods longer than 2 weeks must be noted in the animal's medical record and the attending veterinarian must
provide a justification in the animal's medical record. If holding in such enclosures for medical treatment and/or
medical training is to last longer than 2 weeks, such extension must be justified in writing by the attending
veterinarian on a weekly basis.
