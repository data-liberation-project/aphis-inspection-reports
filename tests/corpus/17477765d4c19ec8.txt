Female Bichon puppy is observed lying in her enclosure while all her litter mates are actively moving around. The puppy
appears lethargic and dull and physical inspection of the animal by the Veterinary Medical Officer revealed that her
extremities, including her ears, are cold to the touch, her abdomen is swollen and she has a rapid respiration rate with an
increased effort on inhalation. A small amount of discharge is coming from the nose. The facility representative had not
noticed the puppy's condition and she has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and is not under any treatment.

Female Golden retriever puppy (tag #707, DOB 06-01-21) appears lethargic, dull and depressed. Physical inspection of
the puppy revealed her extremities, including her ears, are cold to the touch while her body feels hot. All four legs are
swollen, as well as her muzzle, which has a spongy feel to it. Palpation of her abdomen revealed that it may be full of
fluid. The dog is housed with 15 other puppies, but she remained laying on the ground while the majority of the other
puppies actively moved around the enclosure. The puppy is being treated for a cough, intestinal parasites and external
parasites, but she has never been physically examined by a licensed veterinarian and a veterinarian has not evaluated
the dog for her current condition.

Female Golden retriever (tag #576, DOB 07-10-21) appears lethargic, dull and depressed. The puppy's extremities,

including her ears, felt cold to the touch while her body felt hot. Discharge is coming from the nose, the 3rd eyelids on
both eyes are elevated, and the puppy was observed to be drooling. The puppy was also coughing nearly continuously
during the inspection of the animals and the enclosure. The puppy is being treated for a cough, intestinal parasites and
external parasites, but she has never been physically examined by a licensed veterinarian and a veterinarian has not
evaluated the dog for her current condition.

Female Golden retriever (tag #581, DOB 07/2021) is emaciated. Physical examination of the puppy by the Veterinary
Medical Officer revealed very little fat covering her frame and her ribs, hips, and backbone were easily felt and the
backbone is prominent with sunken muscles along both sides. The Veterinary Medical Officer determined the animal has
a Body Condition Score of 3 out of 9. The puppy's extremities, including the ears, felt cold to the touch while her body felt
hot. A small amount of discharge was noticed from both nostrils. The puppy is being treated for a cough, intestinal
parasites and external parasites, but she has never been physically examined by a licensed veterinarian and a
veterinarian has not evaluated the dog for her current condition.

Lethargic, depressed behavior could be an indication that an animal is ill and feeling unwell. During the inspection of the
facility on July 29, 2021, the licensee stated to the inspectors that this site has experienced confirmed positive cases of
Parvovirus in several of their dogs throughout the month of July. Discharge from the nose, abnormal body temperatures,
and poor body condition could indicate an underlying health issue including serious diseases.

Female poodle (tag #371) has an emaciated body condition. The dog has very little fat or muscle covering her frame and
the ribs, backbone, and hip bones are easily felt beneath the haircoat. The Veterinary Medical Officer who physically
examined the animal determined it had a Body Condition Score of 3 out of 9. The facility representative has not noticed

the condition of this animal and she has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and is not under a treatment plan.

Emaciated body condition could indicate a serious underlying health issue.

Male Australian shepherd (tag #272) has poor dental health. Nearly the entire surface of the upper left cheek teeth are
coated in a thick brown tartar. The majority of the surface of the upper left canine tooth and front teeth are also coated in
a dark brown tartar. The entire surface of the lower left cheek teeth are covered in dark brown tartar. The gums are
moderately reddened with a darker red line running along the gum line of all the upper left teeth. The inspectors were not
able to view the right side of the dog's mouth as the animal became to dangerous to handle. The facility representative
had not noticed the condition of the dog's teeth and he has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and is not under
a treatment plan.

Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to further health issues.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times. The facility
representative had the dogs transported to a licensed veterinarian at the time of the inspection.

Female Cavalier (#325) has extremely overgrown toenails. The toenails of the front feet have grown excessively long and
have developed a severe curve.


Female Pomsky (#582) has extremely overgrown toenails. The toenails of the left front foot have grown excessively long
and have developed a severe curve.

Overgrown toenails could cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as affect the dog's natural gait.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must trim the dogs' toenails to an appropriate length and ensure that the toenails of all dogs are properly maintained at all
times.

The licensee and facility representative told APHIS officials that there have been cases of Parvovirus at their kennel that
has been on-going for the past few months. During the current inspection, a random sampling of just five litters of
puppies revealed that no less than eleven puppies had died from Parvovirus according to the facility representative. The
licensee has also sold puppies which have tested positive for Parvovirus and Distemper. The inspector asked the facility
representative if the attending veterinarian is aware of the Parvovirus issues and he said he did not know if the Attending
Veterinarian knew. The inspector called the Attending Veterinarian who confirmed that he was not aware of the
Parvovirus cases and the licensee had never spoken to him about it.

Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems, in a timely manner, can result in prolonged pain and
suffering and the increased risk of development of serious medical conditions.

A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of

animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The licensee must communicate with
the Attending Veterinarian regarding the Parvovirus issues and positive results for Distemper in order to regain control of
the diseases and to protect the lives of the adult dogs and puppies.

To be corrected by: From this day forward the licensee must communicate all problems, issues or concerns related to the
health and well-being of the dogs to the Attending Veterinarian.

Time and method of identification.
Numerous litters of puppies are co-mingled, but no official form of identification has been applied to the animals. The co-
mingled litters include:

A mixed group of eight weaned puppies consisting of at least four different breeds have no form of identification.

A mixed group of one Bernadoodle, one Pomsky and one poodle puppy have no form of identification.

A mixed group of six puppies consisting of two Samoyeds and four Yorkie-type puppies which have no form of official
identification.

Failure to apply an official form of identification to each puppy interferes with APHIS official's ability to identify animals and
trace their movements. Official identification is also necessary to complete required paperwork including medical records.

A class "A" dealer must identify all dogs under 16 weeks old by the use of an official tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo, or

a plastic-type collar containing the required information. APHIS Officials also accept microchips or written identification
attached to the enclosure (cage cards) for puppies under 16 weeks old provided that these puppies are maintained in
distinct litters and provided that the cage card contains all of the required information. The licensee must apply an official
form of identification to each puppy and the licensee must ensure that all dogs are properly identified at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
Four enclosures in the whelping building have gates that are not properly secured. The gates are latched only at the
bottom leaving the upper half of the gate free to be pushed or pulled open resulting in a gap large enough for a dog to
stick its head or legs through. At least 25 dogs are housed in the affected enclosures.

One enclosure containing one adult Boston terrier and two puppies has a large gap in the wall beneath the access door.
The puppies are small enough that they could potentially place their head or leg into the gap.

Gaps in fencing or walls that are large enough to allow a dog to place its body parts through could cause the animal to
become entrapped or injured.


The tile on the back wall of an enclosure, containing one adult dog and two puppies, has fallen from the wall and broken.
The pieces of the tile have been placed on the top edge of the enclosure divider and are at risk of falling into the
enclosure or into the enclosure on the other side of the divider which contains one adult dog and three puppies.

Falling tile could cause injury to the dogs should it land on them or break into smaller pieces that the dogs step on or
consume. The facility representative removed the broken pieces of tile at the time of the inspection.

Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be
kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals
from entering. The licensee must eliminate the gap beneath the access door and have all the gates properly secured to
ensure the dogs have no risk of entrapment or injury. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs

webs hanging from the ceiling and walls and attached to the items used for the dogs. Many of the spider webs have
pieces of insulation attached to them.

The dark colored material and spider webs could collect dust, dirt and disease causing agents.

Housing facilities and areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste

material, junk, weeds, and other discarded materials. The licensee must remove the dark colored material and spider
webs from the storage closest in order to reduce the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs.

collected on the immediate outside of the building. A large number of insects are swarming around the pool and climbing
up the walls of the building.

The inspectors moved a shelter in one covered outdoor enclosure and found a large pile of feces and other organic
material beneath it that had failed to drain from the enclosure. The inspector smelled a foul odor that was permeating
from the feces pile. Two huskies are housed in this enclosure. The enclosure directly next to the huskies has liquid
draining down the back wall from the sheltered building.


Drains and drainage areas that are not properly maintained could result in a buildup of waste that could attract pests,
create odors, soil animals, and increase the risk of disease hazards.

Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All
drains must be properly constructed, installed, and maintained. The licensee must alter all the drains in a manner that
moves the pool of waste away from the exterior of the sheltered building and also eliminates the area of waste in the dog
enclosures. The licensee must ensure that all drains are working properly at all times.

Surfaces of enclosures that have potential contact with dogs must be impervious to moisture in order to allow for proper
cleaning and sanitizing of the surface to prevent the buildup of debris and other materials that can harbor contaminated
and potentially disease-causing agents.

All walls and other surfaces in contact with animals must be impervious to moisture. The licensee must alter the wooden
window frames in a manner that makes them impervious to moisture in order to allow proper cleaning and sanitization of
the surface to occur.

Primary enclosures.

All of the enclosures in the whelping building, housing approximately 111 adults and 87 puppies, have non-compliant
flooring. The floors are constructed of composite boards that are approximately 3 to 4 inches wide, but the gaps between
the boards are wide enough that the legs of puppies and adult dogs will easily fall through them. The inspectors observed
the feet and legs of numerous puppies and adult dogs pass through the openings in the floors. The non-compliant
flooring had been identified by inspectors months previously, but the licensee has done nothing to bring the flooring into
compliance even after the inspectors reminded him at subsequent inspections.

Openings in the flooring that are large enough to allow the dogs' feet and legs to pass through could cause serious injury
to the animals.

Primary enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that does not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any
openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the floors in a manner that will not allow the feet of the dogs to pass

Two Golden retrievers have caked food inside their metal self feeder. The caked feed is embedded into a dried black
substance.

Six puppies have caked and deteriorating feed inside their metal self feeder.

One adult Shiba Inu has an excessive amount of wood shavings mixed into her feed. The amount of shavings in the feed

is large enough to interfere with the dog's ability to eat the food without also consuming shavings.

Four puppies have an excessive amount of wood shavings mixed into their wet food. The puppies cannot consume the
food without also ingesting the wood shavings.

Six golden doodles have an excessive amount of wood shavings covering their food. The dogs cannot access the food
without potentially consuming the wood shavings.

Four adult dogs have an excessive amount of wood shavings covering their food. A thick layer of shavings are piled on
top of the feed and the dog's cannot consume the food without first penetrating the layer of shavings.

Contaminated food may interfere with a dog's desire to eat and its ability to receive adequate nutrition which could result
in poor body condition, illness, and other serious health issues.

Food receptacles must be located so as to minimize contamination. Measures must be taken to prevent molding, caking
and deterioration of the feed. The licensee must remove all moldy, caked, and contaminated food from the feeders and

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
One outdoor shelter, accessed by a total of 16 puppies between 8 and 12 weeks of age, contains straw bedding material.
The majority of the straw bedding is dark in color and compacted together in a solid pile and the inspector had to pull the
layers of straw apart. The layers of straw were wet, dirty, moldy and the material has a strong odor of mold. Blue plastic

material was found mixed into and laying on top of the straw bedding. All 16 puppies with access to this contaminated,
dirty bedding material are under treatment for a cough, intestinal parasites and external parasites. The inspector
observed one of the sick puppies lying in the bedding material with its nose burrowed down into the contaminated straw.

Bedding material contaminated by waste, mold, dirt, and plastic may cause the animals to become wet and soiled, as well
as raise the risk of disease hazards and irritate or worsen existing medical conditions.

Pens, runs, and outdoor housing areas using material that cannot be sanitized using the methods provided in the
regulations, such as gravel, sand, grass, earth, or absorbent bedding, must be sanitized by removing the contaminated
material as necessary to prevent odors, diseases, pests, insects, and vermin infestation. The licensee must ensure that all

top of this wall block wall. Large amounts of rodent feces are located in the enclosures that have no dogs. No pest
control is located around the covered outdoor enclosures. Failure to control pests such as rodents could cause
contamination of food sources, as well as raise the risk of disease hazards.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that
are pests, must be established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective plan to control the mice and the
licensee must ensure that all pest control programs are effective at all times.

APHIS officials identified 24 non-compliant items during the inspection which includes 8 dogs in need of veterinary care.
The facility currently has approximately 3 staff members including the licensee to provide care for over 262 dogs. The
facility does not have enough employees to maintain compliance. Failure to have a sufficient number of employees to
maintain the facility in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act could have a serious impact on the health and well-being
of the animals.

Each person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations maintaining dogs must have enough employees to carry out the

Veterinary care for dogs.
According to the facility representative, this kennel is currently experiencing an outbreak of Parvovirus resulting in the
deaths of numerous puppies and multiple puppies originating from this facility have tested positive for Parvovirus and
another puppy has tested positive for Distemper.

Review of the Program of Veterinary Care revealed that vaccination for Parvovirus should be given at 4 weeks of age and
6 weeks of age. The licensee is vaccinating for Parvovirus at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks of age.

The schedule for vaccinating for Distemper in the Program of Veterinary Care is 5 weeks and 7 weeks of age. The
licensee is vaccinating for Distemper at 4, 5, 6, and 7 weeks of age.

Failure to follow the vaccination schedule in the Program of Veterinary Care, which has been reviewed and signed by the
facilities Attending Veterinarian, does not ensure the puppies are receiving appropriate protection against serious and
deadly diseases including Parvovirus and Distemper.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes a schedule for the vaccination of contagious and /or deadly diseases of
dogs. The licensee must follow the vaccination schedule documented in the Program of Veterinary Care to ensure the
puppies are receiving adequate protection against contagious and/or deadly diseases.


The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete. The section for parasites states:

Ectoparasites: 10% weekly- Frontline spray
Bloodparasites: 10% every other monthly
Intestinal parasites: 10% every other monthly (fen/benmetro and Toltazurl)

The facility representative was not sure what the statement for ectoparasites is supposed to mean and he has not been
using Frontline spray. The facility representative did not know what the blood parasite and intestinal parasite statements
are supposed to mean.

The sections for blood parasites does not define the plan for sampling and treatment. The section for intestinal parasites
does not define the plan for sampling and the plan for treatment of adult dogs and puppies.

An incomplete Program of Veterinary Care does not ensure that prevention and treatment of parasites is conducted
appropriately which could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian that includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests (including fleas,
worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm). The licensee must define in writing a complete plan for sampling and treatment

The licensee uses cage cards to document when and what type of vaccinations the puppies receive while at the facility.
The licensee sold puppies who then tested positive for Parvovirus and/or Distemper. The inspectors received APHIS
form 7006 which listed each of these sick puppies along with an official identification number. The inspectors requested
the cage cards for these sick puppies in order to review the vaccinations that had been administered to the puppies, but
the identification numbers on the cage cards and APHIS form 7006 did not match and the inspectors were unable to
determine if the vaccination records belonged to the sick puppies and if the puppies had ever received the vaccinations.

Female Doberman (tag #487) was previously under a treatment plan. The medical record documenting the treatment she
received does not include her official identification number.

Female Husky (ear tattoo #73) has a medical record containing information concerning an abnormality. The record has
#321 documented as her official identification number, but the dog has #73 tattooed inside her ear and has never been
assigned any other identification number such as a metal tag. The facility representative said they have always referred
to her as #321 as that is what he thought her ear tattoo was.

Medical records and other documents which lack proper animal identification interferes in the ability of APHIS officials to
determine if an animal has received adequate veterinary care including vaccinations for serious and potentially deadly
diseases.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. These
records must include the identity of the animal, including identifying marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s

breed, sex, and age. The licensee must ensure that all documents, including cage cards and APHIS form 7006, contain
the proper identification number in order to allow APHIS officials to determine which animal the paperwork belongs to.
3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee is treating 16 golden retriever puppies for fleas with Ivomec pour-on. The facility representative stated that
he mixes the Ivomec pour-on with oil and does not have an exact dosage for applying it to the animals. The facility
representative presented written instructions for the Ivomec pour-on that were approved by the Attending Veterinarian, but
the instructions do not include a dosage or the approval for the product to be mixed with oil. An incomplete treatment
plan does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Female Doberman (tag #487) was previously receiving veterinary treatment and was re-evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian during the week of September 6th, and it was determined that she requires further treatment. There is no
medical record of this examination or of the new treatment plan. Failure to create and maintain a medical record
interferes with APHIS officials ability to ensure the dog is receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. Should a
problem be identified, these records must include the date and a description of the problem, examination findings, test
results, the plan for treatment and care as well as any treatment procedures performed. The licensee must ensure the
plan to use the Ivomec pour-on is complete with all necessary details and the licensee must also create a medical record
for the Doberman documenting the evaluation and treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all treatment plans are
fully and completely documented at all times.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
