FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor primary enclosure fence for 3 reindeer has taken on storm damage from fallen trees. The fence is still
secure and the damage is to the upper areas. The licensee has acquired a contractor to remove the tress which will
take time because the entire area had extremely high winds and flooding over the weekend. The licensee must
replace or repair the upper fence areas that are bent to maintain the fence in good repair.
(A longer the normal correction period is granted due to inclement weather) Correct by 4-20-2017
(The exit interview was conducted with the licensee).
