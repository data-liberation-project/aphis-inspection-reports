FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A perimeter fence of acceptable height, 8 feet for dangerous animals and 6 feet for all others, is not in place at this
facility. The bears, leopard and cougar are partially enclosed by a perimeter fence 8 feet high and other species
including capybara, fox and otter are only partially enclosed by a fence at least 6 feet high. A perimeter fence of
specific height is required to keep unauthorized persons and animals out and to function as a secondary
containment system in case of escape.
Perimeter fence construction was taking place during this inspection. The facility is building an eight foot fence that
will enclose all animals and is anticipated to be complete within thirty days. Correct by: December 14, 2017.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
