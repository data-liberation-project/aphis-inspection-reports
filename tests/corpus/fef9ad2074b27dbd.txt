ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the whelping building of the kennel facility there is a three month old female Poodle, chip # 0802482720, which
needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The animal had been sold and returned the previous week.
The animal was observed with a matted left eye, a dull hair coat and it's movements were very slow. The dealer
stated she had been treating the animal since it's return but it had not been evaluated by the attending veterinarian
nor did the dealer have any treatment records. The animal must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and the
dealer must maintain written documentation of the evaluation and all treatment.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The kennel facility consists of one indoor whelping building and a sheltered building. In the sheltered building there
are both ground and raised wire enclosures with interior and exterior enclosure portions. The doorway inserts and
or framing for thirty enclosures have rusted with worn and sharp edges and surfaces. These worn rusty doorway
edges and surfaces need to be repaired or replaced to insure all materials can be readily cleaned and sanitized.
Interior surfaces and any surfaces that come in contact with dogs must be free of excessive rust that prevents the
required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface; and be free of jagged edges
or sharp points that might injure the animals.
