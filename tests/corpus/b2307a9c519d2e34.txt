ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a female pug (#508) with a mass protruding from her vulva. The mass is pink, generally moist, and has
several patches of slightly dry and crusty looking areas. There is one area to the bottom of the mass that has a
small amount of oozing blood present with a crusty area. The dog appears healthy and does not seem to be painful
at the time of inspection. Licensee had noticed the mass approximately one week ago and had not started treatment
or contacted the attending veterinarian.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Following the inspection, the licensee contacted the attending veterinarian for treatment and set up an appointment
for the dog to be evaluated on Dec. 15, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Licensee.
