ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care could not be located at the time of the inspection.
The written and signed Program of Veterinary Care, (POVC), is a document that may be needed by the licensee
when preventive veterinary care is needed. This should be available at the facility where the animals are kept. The
POVC must be followed by the licensee and made available at time of USDA inspection to ensure that adequate
veterinary care is provided to the animals.
If copies of the original POVC are not found or provided by your veterinarian then a new POVC (blank provided by
inspector on 04/19/2017) must be completed and signed by your veterinarian.
