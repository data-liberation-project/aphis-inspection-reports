2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several expired medications were present at the facility. The Albon oral suspension 5% was currently in use, and
expired 10/2016. Expired medications may not have the potency necessary for treatment of a medical condition,
and their use is not considered adequate veterinary care. The medication supply must be monitored to ensure that
expired medications are discarded so that they are not inadvertently used for the animals.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
