Requirements and procedures.
Item 2.25 a
On Dec 6, 2020 Royal Air Maroc conducted a USDA regulated transport of a dog to JFK airport in NYC. The airline was
found to be operating and transporting regulated animals without a valid certificate/registration. Each carrier must
register with the Secretary of Agriculture by completing and filing a properly executed registration form; the registration
has been furnished by this inspector.

NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID REGISTRATION IS OBTAINED.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
