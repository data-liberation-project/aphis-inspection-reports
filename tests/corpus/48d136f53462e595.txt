HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures that house dogs are not structurally sound. Two pipe framed gates used to contain animals in two
enclosures are rusted along the bottom. These rusted pipe frames have gaps and are almost rusted through,
compromising the structure of these gates. The owner must repair or replace these areas of the gates to make
them structurally sound. This will help ensure the safety and good care for animals in these enclosures. Correct by
