***There was a female bloodhound named Daisy May (#0A01214630) with discharge surrounding each entire eye.
On closer observation the discharge appeard to be green to yellow, thick and mucoid-like. Also, dry crusty green
material was observed lining the bottom lid of the right eye. The fur in the corner of each eye appeared dark brown
to black with crusty material. According to the licensee, she had noticed this dog's eye condition and it had been
present for 2 to 3 weeks. Licensee stated this condition occurs every time this dog whelps. Injuries and infections of
the eyes are usually painful and may lead to loss of vision. The condition affecting Daisy's eyes occured every time
she whelps but no contact with a veterinarian had been made prior to this inspection and, therefore, appropriate
methods to control or treat this animal's condition have not been implemented.
There was a male sheltie named Blue ( microchip number 038568359 ) has an injury to his face and nose area. The
lower portion of his nose and muzzle on the right side has been removed as a result of an accident. The injured
edge of the nose and muzzle is no longer adhered to itself and a gap is present. The edges of the gap are rough,
thickened and hairless. One area of moist tissue is visible at the front edge of the wound. The licensee reports it
happened a long time ago and a re-injury occurred aproximately 3 days ago and was due to a fight between the
fence. The attending veterinarian had not been contacted and according to the licensee, the veterinarian is on
vacation but was scheduled to be on the property in a week. This dog has not been evaluated by the veterinarian at
the time of inspection.
These animals must be seen by a licensed veterinarian for a complete physical exam and appropriate treatment
administered for these conditions

3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The chicken wire dividers lining the Yorkshire terriers outside enclosure were not securely fastened and sagging in
many areas. In some cases, the wire itself had broken creating sharp points, while in other areas of the enclosures
the wire used to attach the divider to the enclosure wall was broken. The loose chicken wire could potentially allow
an animal to become injuried or entrap a limb between the chicken wire and the enclosure fencing. All structures
must be kept in good repair. These chicken wires must be reattached, replaced or removed.
