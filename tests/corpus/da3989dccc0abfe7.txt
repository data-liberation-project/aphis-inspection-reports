2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee is not properly identifying puppies that are less than 16 weeks old. Two 4-week-old puppies from the
same litter did not have any form of identification. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet
recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must
properly identify puppies with an acceptable form of identification, which include a cage card (if litters are not
comingled), a microchip, a collar and tag, or a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written.

buildup of dirt on the outside and grime on the inside of the shelters in the outdoor facility. Dirt and grime can
harbor diseases that can affect the health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces that come into
contact with the dogs are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards
and practices.
