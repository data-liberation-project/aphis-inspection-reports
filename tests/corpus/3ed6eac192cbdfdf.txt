A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:15AM on
27-Jul-17.Inspector knocked at the door at the animal facility address and received no answer. The inspector waited
30 min in the driveway of the facility. The inspector then drove to the Licensee's residence address and knocked on
the door. A female at the residence indicated that the Licensee was not available and asked that a call be placed to
the Licensee's cell phone The inspector then called the number on file and left a message for a return call on the
Licensee's cellphone. The inspector waited 30 minutes in the driveway of the residence before leaving the area.
Lack of availability for inspection inhibits the regulatory process. The licensee must ensure a knowledgeable,
responsible adult is available during regular hours to accompany inspection.
