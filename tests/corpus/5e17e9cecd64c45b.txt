2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On 3/12/22 the licensee vaccinated all of her adult dogs, including pregnant dogs, for distemper and rabies. The program
of Veterinary specifically states not to vaccinate pregnant dogs. The licensee stated 3 or 4 of the dogs vaccinated on that
date were pregnant. Not following the Program of Veterinary Care doesn't ensure the Attending Veterinarian has the
appropriate authority to ensure that adequate veterinary care is being given to all the dogs. The license must discontinue
vaccinating pregnant dogs as per the Program of Veterinary Care and must follow all instructions in the Program of
Veterinary as written.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 3/12/23 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
