MISCELLANEOUS.
Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspector arrived at 12:30 PM on 4/13/15 to conduct an inspection but the designated contact person for the
registrant was not on the premises. The inspector was able to reach the contact person by phone and learned that
he/she was out of state and would not return for several days.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other facility representative available
who could locate and provide access to the IACUC documents and other records required to be kept by the AWA
and
the Regulations.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility
and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This was the FIRST attempted inspection of this registrant. Report delivered by e-mail 4/16/15.
