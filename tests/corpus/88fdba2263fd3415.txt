3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The standard method for providing food and water to the rabbits is a food hopper and automatic lixit watering system, but
bowls may also be added to the enclosure for some rabbits. Many primary enclosures had a flat, ~1 ½” x 3” rectangular
shaped hard plastic bar secured to the front of the enclosure that is the base for a “quick lock” style food/water bowl, but
there was no bowl present. The rectangular plastic bar in at least 12 enclosures had pointed and/or sharp edges from the
rabbits chewing on the plastic. The pointed and/or sharp edges can cause an injury to the rabbits' face, mouth, or eyes.

Per this Section, primary enclosures for rabbits shall be maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury. The
primary enclosure includes the enclosure itself and any objects such as food/water receptacles and enrichment items that
are present inside the enclosure. The plastic bars for the “quick-lock” style food/water bowls should be removed or
replaced when worn or damaged to protect the rabbits from injury. Correct by 7/13/22

Watering.
Husbandry staff had been in rabbit housing area #26 to refill water receptacles just prior to the inspection team going into
the area. The APHIS inspector noted that 7 water bowls had a green colored material coating the inside of the bottom


and sides of these bowls.

Per this Section, sufficient potable water shall be provided daily and all watering receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty.
Water that is contaminated by the presence of foreign material can result in decreased water consumption by the rabbits
and subsequently can affect their health. This item was corrected during the inspection by cleaning the water receptacles
and refilling with fresh water.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
