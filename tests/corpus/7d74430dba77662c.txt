ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Four dogs in the main kennel and whelping boxes a cavalier identified as "Lexi", a white bichon identified as #28
"Benny", a black and white bichon identified as #13 "Brady", and a yorkshire terrier identified as #35 "Megan" were
noted to have matted fur and long nails. Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin which is painful and cause
potential skin irritations. Long nails may get caught in the wire mesh which could lead to injury. Long nails may also
cause abnormal splaying of the toes which can lean to chronic foot problems. These dogs need to be groomed on a
routine basis to prevent these mats from developing and to keep the nails an appropriate length for the health and
safety of the dog.
**In addition, #13 "Brady" was noted to be thin with prominent back bones and hip bones on back end and easily felt
ribs. He is a young adult animal (4 years), and has access to ad lib food. There may be an underlying health
problem that is causing him to lose weight or preventing him from gaining weight. This dog should be assessed by
the attending veterinarian to appropriately diagnose and treat any issue.
*** In addition, # 25 Megan was noted to have accumulation of tartar and redness of the gums. Routine dental care
needs to be addressed at this facility for adequate prevention and control of dental problems. This dog should be
assessed by the attending veterinarian for appropriate dental care.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***The wood frames of the wire mesh enclosures have several areas of wood that have been scratched and
chewed. Some parts of the wood frame appear to be urine stained. These surfaces are not impervious to moisture.
These areas need to be repaired and sealed to repel moisture to facilitate cleaning and sanitation of the kennel.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***Young puppies are coming out of the whelping boxes onto the wire mesh. Their feet can pass through the holes
in the mesh, which may predispose to injury. An additional surface needs to be placed into the wire mesh portion of
the enclosure to prevent their feet from passing through the openings in the mesh.

***Much of the wire mesh flooring in the kennel has coating that is coming off the wires. This exposed metal wire
may predispose to injury, as well as corrode over time and compromise structural integrity. This coating needs to be
addressed to keep the enclosures in good repair for the safety of the animals.
