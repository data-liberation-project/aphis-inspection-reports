Facilities, outdoor.
A male giraffe is housed in a large enclosure that has no shelter. The enclosure has no trees or other natural structures to
provide a wind break or shade. Employees stated the giraffe arrived on 12/9/2021 and would only be at this site
temporarily but did not know when he was scheduled to be moved. The temperatures were in the 40's for at least one
night after the giraffe arrived and a cold front with rain and low temperatures in the 40's is predicted within the next 72
hours. Giraffe are very sensitive to wet and cold conditions ( temperatures below 50 ) . Exposure to such conditions is
likely to cause discomfort and distress. A shelter that provides adequate protection for the giraffe must be provided to
prevent discomfort.
