Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During this inspection, the following animals and conditions were observed:

-In the 4th pen, stack 1A, there was a tan and white female adult guinea pig housed with 2 other guinea pigs with hair loss
and numerous scabs between its' eyes. The area of hair loss was approximately 1 inch in diameter.
-In the 5th pen, stack 2A, there was a red male adult guinea pig housed with 2 other guinea pigs with chronic thickening of
the skin of the right ear with some patches of thickening on the left ear.
-In the 5th pen, stack 8B, there was a red and white adult guinea pig housed with 4 other guinea pigs with hair loss and
reddened skin on the bridge of the nose approximately 1/2 inch in diameter.

In five of the pens and beneath one rack, there were 4 skeletons, 1 carcass, and 1 partial disintegrated carcass with hair
and some skin remaining.

The licensee reported that he had not observed any of these conditions prior to the inspection and none of the animals
were currently being treated. He also admitted to not cleaning the pens in over 2 months.


Failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can result in a delay of
care provided to animals and can prolong animal health problems and add suffering. All animals must be observed daily
to assess their health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending
veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.

The three animals with veterinary conditions identified above require examination by a veterinarian to prevent worsening
of the conditions. Additionally, the licensee must provide documentation of such examination and treatment to APHIS
officials upon request. Remains uncorrected.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
No inventory records were available at time of inspection. A total of 220 adults and 1 weanling were counted during the
inspection. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal
losses by decreased number of guinea pigs born or raised. The licensee must maintain records containing the required
information for animals which discloses the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired, or disposed of including births
and deaths. Remains uncorrected.
3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Structural strength. At least ten guinea pigs were observed loose on the floor of the guinea pig room and underneath the
dirty racks. Enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair so as to contain the animals and protect
them from injury. Loose guinea pigs are susceptible to injury and even death. Remains uncorrected.
3.25(d)

Facilities, general.

Waste disposal. The room adjacent to the guinea pig room used for emptying enclosure trays, dead animals, and waste
was filthy. A bucket was on the floor containing dirty bedding and dead guinea pigs. This room had hay, dirt, racks of dirty
soiled trays, extensive cobwebs and the floor was covered with waste and debris. The floor of the animal room contained
spilled hay, a pile of grass clippings, dirt and debris. The animal room and waste disposal area needs to be cleaned and
maintained to support good animal husbandry and health. Correct by ensuring the animal room and the waste disposal
area are operated and maintained so that animal waste, food waste, bedding, dead animals, and debris are properly
disposed of and operated to minimize disease hazards and odors. Correct by August 29, 2022.
3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
There were two loose partitions in the upper sides of the 1st pen, rack 2B that were detached with gaps. There were also
areas of protruding pointed ends on the partitions. Some of the smaller guinea pigs were observed to be escaping into
other pens near the PVC pipe for the feeder. Failure to maintain enclosures in good repair can allow animals to escape or
become injured if caught on the exposed wire. The licensee must ensure that enclosures are structurally sound and
maintained in good repair. Correct by August 29, 2022.
3.29(d) Direct

Feeding.
Food receptacles. The majority of the PVC pipe feeders in the back corners of the pens were caked with moldy feed,
feces, and debris. Failure to clean and sanitize the feeders can contaminate the food and can cause health risks in the
animals. All food receptacles must be kept clean and must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by August
25, 2022.
3.31(a)(1) Direct

Sanitation.

There were accumulations of feces, soiled bedding, carcasses, and moldy food in all guinea pig enclosures. At least six of
the enclosures contained soaked wet bedding. The licensee stated he had not cleaned the pens in over two months nor
sanitized the enclosures in over two months. The cleaning process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective.
Ineffective cleaning and sanitation can expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards and health risks. Primary enclosures
must be cleaned often enough to prevent accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, and debris. In addition, enclosures
must be sanitized at least every two weeks. Correct by August 25, 2022.
3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.
Housekeeping. The floor and area underneath the racks contained loose hay, dirty shavings, feces, dirt and debris. Dirty
water was pooling under the racks and onto the floor. Animal facilities must be kept clean to prevent unnecessary disease
risks. Ineffective cleaning and housekeeping can expose the animals to disease hazards, pest problems, and health
problems. Correct by ensuring the premises are kept clean, including: removing dust, dirt, debris, hay, droppings, and
clutter from the floor of the animal room, cleaning surfaces; and maintaining a level of general cleanliness to support good
animal husbandry and health. Remains uncorrected.
