2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is a three foot high post and rope barrier across the front of the brown bear enclosure that allows the public to
photograph the bear while an attendant feeds it.
This barrier extends from the double entrance of the enclosure to within eight feet of the end of the viewing area.
This eight foot gap needs to be closed off because it allows the public to touch and extend cameras through the
main enclosure fence while the bear is in the enclosure.
This presents a dangerous situation for the public and does not comply with the regulations for sufficient barriers
between the viewing public and the bear.

SANITATION.
The outside cages housing mink have had food placed on top of the cage for the mink to reach through and feed.
Two of these cages have large areas on the top of the cage that have old and dried meat residue on them. The
indoor area housing mink has one corner that has an accumulation of fecal matter that needs to be cleaned and
removed from the enclosure.
Even though the facility has a regular schedule of cleaning, it needs to be done more frequently to maintain a
cleaner environment for the mink. A regular schedule of cleaning as often as necessary, of all cages needs to be in
place to maintain a clean enclosure free of any food or fecal accumulations that could encourage the growth of
bacteria, mold, or fungus. This will minimize the potential of disease hazards for the animals in the enclosures.
