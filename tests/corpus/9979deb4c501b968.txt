Personnel qualifications.
At the time of inspection, in barn 9, a rabbit in pen 156 has a lump that is actively bleeding– with the diameter measuring
approximately the size of a silver dollar- along the inside right rear foot. There is hair loss along the underside of said foot
with old scarring, and hair thinning along the top side. The animal is slow to move at times, but otherwise appears to be in
good condition. After speaking with the caretakers, it was noted that all the animals were fed and checked earlier in the
morning. Another set of daily observations were to begin later in the afternoon. The first caretaker did not notice the
lump/bleeding when he picked it up to check it earlier in the morning. Failure to notice injuries and/or medical issues, can
lead to unnecessary discomfort, negatively impact the overall well-being of the animal, and even death. The research
facility is responsible for ensuring that all animal technicians and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and
use are qualified to perform their duties. The facility addressed the issue and AV completed training with the animal
caretakers the next day.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.


At the time of the inspection, in barn 9, the rabbit in cage number 42 is squinting, and has swelling and redness around its
left eye, along with a buildup of green discharge and mucous. The hair around this eye is wet, and there are green crusts
along some of the eye lashes. The animal appears to otherwise be in good condition. After discussing this rabbits’
condition with some of the caretakers, it was noted that the animal was being treated for the issue since the beginning of
November 2021, whereby it would receive an application of a topical antibiotic once or twice every week or so. The
caretakers mentioned it would get better, then come back again since it was first noticed in early November. The
attending veterinarian (AV) was never notified of the ongoing condition and its duration of over a month. Failing to notify
the AV of unresolved conditions can lead to long-term discomfort and negatively impact the well-being of the animal. A
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is needed so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the AV. The AV was made aware of the animal’s condition and is
being treated.
