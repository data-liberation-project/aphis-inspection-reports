Veterinary care for dogs.
Program of Veterinary Care presented at time of inspection did not mention the regularly scheduled visit by the attending
veterinarian to all premises nor that a complete head to tail examination of each dog would occur, that vaccinations for
rabies would be given, that sampling and treatment of parasites (including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia and heartworm)
would be done nor did it include a schedule for the sampling. The Program of Veterinary Care did not mention any
schedule of when preventative care and treatment (including eyes, ears, skin, teeth, hair coat and nails) would occur.

An appropriate Program of Veterinary Care must include a regular visit by the attending veterinarian to inspect all
premises, a complete head to tail examination of each dog, vaccinations for deadly diseases, sampling for parasites and
preventative care to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that includes regular visits by the attending
veterinarian, vaccinations, a plan for the routine sampling of heartworm, intestinal parasites and ectoparasites. It must
also include a schedule for preventative care. The licensee must add regular visits by the attending veterinarian, a
schedule to vaccinate the dogs, to have the dogs sampled for parasites and a schedule for preventative care to the


Program of Veterinary Care for Dogs.
