ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:20 pm on
23-Oct-17.
** I called the facility and left a message at about 12:20 pm. The owner returned the call that he was unable to leave
his occupation. I let him know that this would be an attempted inspection. I left the area at about 1:00 pm.
