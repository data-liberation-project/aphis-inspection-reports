ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are 3 Yorkies Robert (M), Julie(F) and Sherry(F) that are black/brown that have multiple matts covering their
eyes and body. While the majority of matts are loose around the body, the matts covering their eyes need to be
trimmed to allow the animals to see properly and to avoid causing discomfort and agitation to their eyes and body .
Sherry's' eyes are red and raw in appearance with a clear watery discharge that appears to be from the hair being
pulled by the matts surrounding her eyes. She also has multiple 'gummy' type matts all over her legs, feet and head
that need to be trimmed.
Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort if left to tighten due to lack of trimming. Dirt and debris can be caught up
in the matts and provide a source of infection or irritation to the animal, especially if around the eyes, nose and
mouth.
The licensee must keep all regulated animals hair coats trimmed and orderly as often as necessary to prevent matts
from developing and to trim around the eyes if the hair or matts collect causing vision loss and/or irritation. The
veterinarian needs to be contacted about the eye condition for the named Sherry.
