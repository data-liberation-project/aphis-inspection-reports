2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 10-month-old white and tan male English Bulldog named Chase born on 08/23/17 was found to have a large “hot
spot” involving most of his chest. The area was dark and red, hard and firm to the touch and involved matted fur.
The licensee said Chase had not been examined by the attending veterinarian since her last visit on 06/08/18 which
was before Chase had any medical issues. Licensee said she was treating Chase with Vetericyn Spray which was
unlabeled and had an expiration date of 11/2017. Also on the premises was a bottle of Gentocin spray that the
licensee said she also uses for skin conditions that was labeled for another dog and had expired on 10/2017. The
program of veterinary care did not specify any protocol for treating skin conditions.
Skin infections can readily spread and cause itching and irritation that can be painful. The licensee must have
Chase examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care in a timely manner and are treated with properly
labeled and effective medications.
