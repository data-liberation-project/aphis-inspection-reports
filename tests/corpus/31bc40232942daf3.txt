2.75(b)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for animals at hand containing required information on acquisition, addition and/or disposition of these,
were not available for inspection. There were no records or information on the recent acquisition of one juvenile
bobcat, one juvenile Virginia opossum and two recently born juvenile North American river otters. The licensee
shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose information on purchased or
otherwise acquired animals, and that are in his or her possession/control. The Record of Animals on Hand (APHIS
Form 7019) and Record of Acquisition, Disposition, or Transport of Animals (APHIS Form 7020) are forms which
may be used by the licensee to keep and maintain the information required by federal regulations. The licensee
needs to obtain/document the required information on all recently acquired animals as soon as possible.
