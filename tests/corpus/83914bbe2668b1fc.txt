FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Elephants at the facility are sometimes housed over night without shelter from rain when the temperature is above
50 degrees Fahrenheit. Staff at the facility stated that during heavy periods of rain the elephants are either locked in
the barn or have access to the barn. Due to the conformation of the elephant enclosure, only one elephant at a time
may be offered access to both the barn and the outdoor enclosure. On the day of the inspection, one elephant had
been locked out of the barn the previous evening with no access to shelter. The local low temperature overnight had
been approximately 55 degrees Fahrenheit with a rain total of 0.04 inches. According to staff at the facility,
elephants have been routinely locked out without shelter during light periods of rain in the past. They also stated
that they intended to build a shelter for the outdoor enclosure with a probable October 2015 completion date.
The local climate has abundant rainfall. Exposure to rain (especially at cooler temperatures) may cause discomfort
to animals. The facility should ensure that all elephants have access to shelter during inclement weather to afford
them protection and to prevent their discomfort.
