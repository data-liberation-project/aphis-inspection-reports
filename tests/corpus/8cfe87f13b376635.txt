RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
The records for the semiannual facility inspection, conducted October 16, 2014, identified and documented minor
deficiencies found throughout the animal holding areas. However, some of these noted deficiencies did not have
correction dates listed. Correction dates inform the Institutional Official of the time in which the IACUC expects the
deficiencies to be corrected. The registrant must ensure that the semiannual reports are complete and contain a
specific plan and schedule with dates for each of the deficiencies noted.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: The next IACUC meeting
This inspection was conducted March 16-17, 2015.
The exit interview was conducted on 17 March 2015 with facility representatives.
