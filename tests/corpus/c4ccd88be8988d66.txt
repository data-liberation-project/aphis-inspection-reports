MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on02-Jul-18 at 2:45 PM.
Arrived at the facility and called and left a message for the facility representative. Waited half an hour and left my
card at the door. Received a call back later in the afternoon that the facility representative was on the other side of
campus and unavailable.
