RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
At the time of this inspection there was not a written protocol for the activity using covered species. Anytime a
covered species is used in research a written protocol must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to the
use of the animal. Some of the concepts that should be included in the protocol are:
* Identification of the species and approximate numbers to be used in a given timeframe.
* A rationale for involving the animals chosen.
* A complete description of the proposed use of the animals.
* A description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that which is
unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research
* Provisions for the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs where indicated and appropriate to
minimize
discomfort and pain
* Description of euthanasia method to be used.
A written protocol for this activity needs to be developed and reviewed by the IACUC. The IACUC must maintain
records of all protocols reviewed and whether approval was given or withheld.
To be corrected immediately.
