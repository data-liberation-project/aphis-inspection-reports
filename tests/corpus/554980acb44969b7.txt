3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The surfaces at the entrance of the walkway area in front of rows 1 through 4 of the breeding room are not
constructed of materials that will allow them to be readily sanitized. Interior surfaces and any surfaces that come in
contact with the dogs must be constructed in a manner that will allow them to be sanitized. The surface paint has
started to chip away from the floor and is leaving 2 large areas that can’t be properly sanitized. The licensee must
replace or repair these two surface areas to allow for proper sanitation to protect the health of the 72 adult dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
3 screened in windows of the whelping room are covered in dust, dirt, hair and debris. Premises including buildings
must be kept clean to facilitate adequate husbandry practices required per this section of the regulations. A dirty
whelping room with windows open with screens covered in dirt can cause veterinary care problems to the puppies
and mothers housed in this area. The licensee must use a soap or detergent and clean off the 3 dirty screens.
