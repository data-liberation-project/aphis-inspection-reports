2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
In accordance with 2.126(c) a written itinerary is required to be submitted to the Regional Director at
ACWest@aphis.usda.gov no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate
information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's
approved site. As defined in the regulation, the itinerary shall include the following:
(i) The name of the person who intends to exhibit the animal and transport the animal for exhibition purposes,
including any business name and current Act license or registration number and, in the event that any animal is
leased, borrowed, loaned, or under some similar arrangement, the name of the person who owns such animal;
(ii) The name, identification number or identifying characteristics, species (common or scientific name), sex and age
of each animal; and
(iii) The names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the animals will travel, be housed, and be exhibited,
including all anticipated dates and locations (with addresses) for any stops and layovers that allow or require
removal of the animals from the transport enclosures. Unanticipated delays of such length shall be reported to the
AC Regional Director the next APHIS business day. APHIS Regional offices are available each weekday, except on
Federal holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
As a Class C exhibitor with no reported primary site, submitting an itinerary for the traveling animals is crucial to
ensuring that the animals are maintained in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. Ashley Hoskins brought
"Bruce" the male intact pug to the Western Fair Association Convention and Trade Show inAnaheim, CA Jan 3-6, 2018. There have been no itineraries submitted to the Regional Director or
ACWest@aphis.usda.gov in 2016 or 2017.
The addresse and the dates when the animals are there must be reported in advance to the Regional Office in order
to facilitate Animal Welfare Act Inspections. Itineraries must be submitted to the Regional Director with the required
information no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel or move. Exhibitors who repeatedly provide less than 48
hours(cid:25) notice will be subjected to increased scrutiny under the Act.
To be Corrected from this day forward.
