ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult female Shih Tzu X Poodle (#4771791D4A) had a left eye that was covered with a large mat. The mat
consisted mostly of hair and covered the majority of the eye with only the corner of the eye, near the nose, barely
visible. There appeared to be an excessive amount of clear discharge in the corner of the eye continuing in the fur
down the nose. According to a facility representative, the dog's eye condition had not been noticed prior to it being
pointed out during the inspection. During the inspection, facility representatives removed the mat covering the eye.
Once the mat was removed the dog would squint the left eye in the bright sunlight and would frequently blink once it
was out of the sunlight. The eye appeared to have a pinkish haze throughout the inside of the eye. Some of the
eye discharge also appeared to be green and mucous-like in the fur below the eye. This dog's eye condition could
be due to an injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition which could cause discomfort and/or could lead to
blindness. In conjunction with the exit interview, the licensee provided documentation from a veterinarian that the
dog had been examined by a veterinarian and a treatment plan had been established. The licensee must ensure
that the treatment plan is followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
