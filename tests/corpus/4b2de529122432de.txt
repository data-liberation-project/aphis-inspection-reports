2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
In December 2017, an eight month old Asian small clawed otter was kept in an enclosure that was off exhibit from
the general public. An employee was tending to the animal's general husbandry by washing and filling up a circular
metal tub (approximately 3 feet in diameter) with water. While tending to the otter, the employee dropped the tub on
the animal and the otter died due to the injuries caused by this incident. Following the incident, proper disciplinary
action was taken and the facility developed preventable measures.
The handling of animals should be done in a manner that prevents trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. All animals must be handled in ways that prevent stress or physical harm to their well
being.

3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of inspection, there was still a lack of perimeter fencing around several outdoor housing enclosures,
which include servals, lynx, a hyena, and camels. Perimeter fencing must be of sufficient height (6 feet) for
potentially dangerous animals. The fencing is important to keep unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from
the facility. Perimeter fences must be properly constructed as a secondary containment so as to protect and contain
the regulated species and prevent unwanted entry by animals and unauthorized persons.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
