EMPLOYEES OR ATTENDANTS.
At the time of the inspection, zoo employees stated that a temporary employee responsible for water quality at the
polar bear primary enclosure pool was not aware that one of the chlorine pumps was not working during her shift.
Zoo employees also stated that this same temporary employee failed to contact any of the water quality staff about
this chlorine pump failure and that it was detected at the end of the shift by a supervisor.
During inspection, the zoo veterinary staff stated that they were unaware that the water quality at the polar bear
primary enclosure pool was being maintained by "shocking" the pool with chlorine on a monthly or more frequent
basis. The zoo veterinary staff also stated that they were unaware that the ozone system for the polar bear primary
enclosure pool was not functional due to the wait for replacement parts which had been ordered by the water quality
staff.
Communication between individuals on the water quality staff and the veterinary staff is not occurring in a timely
fashion. Failure to communicate information regarding the polar bear primary enclosure pool could potentially result
in a water quality issue which could affect the health and well-being of the two polar bears. Adequately trained
employees, responsible to management and working with the attending veterinarian, must be utilized to maintain
proper marine mammal husbandry practices. To be corrected by: May 22, 2015.
3.108(b)
EMPLOYEES OR ATTENDANTS.
There is no documentation of the training of a temporary employee who failed to notice a non-functioning chlorine
pump for the polar bear primary enclosure pool. Failure to document employee training and lack of proper reporting
protocols could potentially result in a failure to communicate important information which could affect the health and
well-being of the two polar bears. The facility must provide and document participation in and successful
completion of an employee training course which includes information on proper reporting protocols, recordkeeping,
and notification of veterinary staff. To be corrected by: May 22, 2015.
