HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There was a Husky observed sticking its(cid:25)' head through the square openings of the panel divider inside the little
kennel building. The panel divider, with square openings large enough, that allows for the dogs to stick their heads
through could cause injury to the dogs from getting stuck in the openings or fighting between enclosures. Facilities
must be designed to prevent injury to the dogs. The divider must be replaced or the openings repaired. This will
prevent injury to the four adult dogs.

3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The automatic watering receptacle in the old pig pen kennel or north kennel, housing two adult dogs, metal
surface is excessively rusty. The metal surface is rusted to the point there is flaking.
* The metal panel divider, for the little kennel housing four adult dogs, is excessively rusty. The metal pipe framing
along the bottom of the divider is corroded away in areas.
* The western most enclosure in the main kennel, housing two adult dogs, has metal pipe framing for the panel
fencing that is excessively rusty. The excessively rusty surface is pitting in areas.
These excessively rusted and flaking metal surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. The disease
hazards can increase for the dogs because of improper cleaning and sanitization. The structural of the surface is
also affected. This can allow for dogs to fight under the metal piped framed panel dividers when corroded away.
The metal frame panel fencing, dividers and automatic watering receptacle must be free of excessive rust that
prevents required cleaning and sanitization. These metal surfaces must be treated or replaced. Metal surfaces that
can be properly cleaned and sanitized will reduce the disease hazards for the dogs. Structurally sound metal framed
panels will keep the dogs secure. 3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The old pig pen kennel or north kennel, housing two adult dogs, has an approximate 2 foot long by 1 foot wide
hole in the back wall. This large hole has chewed plastic around it and is allowing for large gaps to be exposed.
The gaps create by the hole can allow for waste to harbored and prevent required cleaning and sanitization.
* The plastic divider inside the little kennel, housing four adult dogs, is excessively chewed along the top edge.
This indicates these surfaces are not being maintained on a regular basis. These surfaces cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized. Improper cleaning and sanitization can cause disease hazards for the dogs. These surfaces
must be treated, repaired or replaced. These surfaces must be impervious to moisture. All surfaces impervious to
moisture can be readily cleaned and sanitized. Proper cleaning and sanitization will reduce the disease hazards for
the dogs.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The inside and front wall of the little kennel building, housing four adult dogs, has an accumulation of brown grime
on the plastic and tin surfaces. This indicates that daily spot-cleaning and frequent sanitization is not taking place.
Improper cleaning and sanitization can increase the disease hazards for the four dogs. Hard surfaces must be
spot-cleaned daily to prevent accumulation of excreta and grime. Required cleaning and sanitization will reduce
disease hazards for the dogs.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* The old pig or north kennel, housing two adult dogs, has no shelter with a roof, four sides and a floor. Although
the dogs have a shelter to protect them from the sunlight, there is no four sided shelter with a floor to protect them
from the extreme cold weather elements. Without adequate protection from the elements, the dogs could suffer in
the extreme cold weather elements. A shelter must be provided with a roof, four sides and a floor to protect the
dogs from extreme cold weather elements. Proper shelter from the cold weather elements will allow for the dogs to
be comfortable.
To be corrected by, 30-August-2014.3.4(c) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* The old pig pen kennel (north kennel), housing two adult dogs, has approximately ½ to ¼ inch wide by 1 to 4 foot
long cracks in the concrete flooring. Inside the cracks, there is brown to black waste and or debris. The large
cracks in the concrete with waste and debris indicate the concrete flooring is not impervious to moisture. The
concrete flooring for the outdoor enclosures is worn. The large cracks prevent the concrete flooring from being
readily cleaned and sanitized. Therefore, this can cause disease hazards for the dogs housed in the enclosures.
Concrete flooring that is worn with large cracks must be repaired or replaced. The concrete flooring must be
impervious to moisture for required cleaning and sanitization. Proper cleaning and sanitization will reduce disease
hazards for the dogs.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The automatic watering receptacle in the old pig pen kennel (north kennel) has an accumulation of green algae in
the water. There is an excessive accumulation of green algae inside two plastic water bowls in the main kennel.
The algae and green slime indicate the watering receptacles are not being cleaned and sanitized often enough.
This can cause disease hazards for the six adult dogs housed in the all the mentioned enclosures. Watering
receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized more often to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris and slime. More
required cleaning and sanitization of watering receptacles will reduce disease hazards for the dogs.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
This inspection will be sent both regular and certified mail.
