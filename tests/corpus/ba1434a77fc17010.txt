2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-An adult female Maltese (0A02492440) was observed with matting of her fur from approximately the midpoint of the
back towards her tail and down her back legs. This area of hair appeared to have patchy hair loss as well. On
closer observation there were live fleas observed on the dog and some of the skin appeared red and scaly.
-An adult female Maltese (037890890) had thin hair and red skin lesion on her rear legs. There were sections of
skin along both rear legs of the dog below her knees, that appeared inflamed, bright red and moist. The fur in this
region of the skin lesions also appeared wet. A live flea was observed on the dog.
-An adult male Dachshund (0A02093065) had a dental condition and hair loss. The the dog had a build up of
yellowish brown to dark brown material on its teeth. This abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the
cheek teeth and extended into the gumline. The gums were reddened along some of these teeth. There was a
horizontal line of greyish white material noted in the area of the gum tissue above some of the upper cheek teeth on
both sides of the mouth. This dog also had hair loss around the base of the tail extending down the back of the
dog's legs and tail. A few small to pinpoint sized scab-like and red circular lesions were observed on the exposed
skin which also appeared flakey.
-An adult male Schnauzer (0A02624979) had matting of his hair coat located generally across his entire body. The
mats varied in size. Some of the mats were tightly adhered to the skin. The hair also appeared thinner with the
dog's skin easily visible on the animal's chest and legs.
The red skin lesions, scab-like lesions and scaly skin can indicate an infection or other veterinary medical condition
that could cause discomfort. Matting in dogs can increase the risk of skin sores and can cause discomfort. The
abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This can be
painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal.
The licensee was not aware of the dog's with the skin lesions or the dog with the dental condition. No treatment was
currently being given to these dogs for their skin conditions. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian regarding
the conditions of adult female Maltese dogs (0A02492440) and (037890890) and must have the male Dachshund
(0A02093065) examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and
appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must ensure male Schnauzer (0A02624979)
is groomed and must establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all dogs. The licensee must develop and
establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the
facility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by:November 1, 2017
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
-An adult large breed dog was housed in an outdoor enclosure without any bedding material provided inside the
shelter unit. According to the licensee, there was no bedding material in the shelter unit overnight. According to the
National Weather Service the high temperature in the area for the past 24 hours from the time of inspection was
recorded at 57 degrees Fahrenheit and the low temperature was recorded at 38 degrees Fahrenheit. The cold
temperature and lack of bedding increase the risk of negative health impacts on the dog. When the temperatures
drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit all the animals must be provided with bedding. When the temperature drops
below 35 degrees Fahrenheit all the animals must be provided with more bedding, enough so that the animals can
burrow down into the bedding to stay warm. The licensee was verbally instructed to provide bedding to the shelter
of the affected dog as required by this regulation from this point forward on October 25, 2017.
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
-There were several dogs at the facility that were observed with live fleas on their skin and/or fur. These dogs were
also occasionally observed scratching at their sides and some had patchy areas of hair loss and some had skin
lesions. Fleas increase the risk of diseases in the dogs and can cause discomfort to the dogs. The licensee must
establish and maintain a safe and effective program of pest control so as to promote the health and well being of the
animals at all times.
This inspection and a preliminary verbal exit interview were conducted with the licensee on October 25, 2017. An
exit interview was completed with the licensee on October 26, 2017.
