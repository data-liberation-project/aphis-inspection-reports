ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* There were six 16 oz. bottles of Giardicox fluid that had no expiration date recorded on the label. The dispense
date of 4/23/15 had been recorded on the label. The medications were intermingled with other products that are
currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. Medications must be labeled with appropriate
and accurate information to ensure that the contents and dosage rates of the container can be known with certainty
and not used past their expiration date. If the expiration date is unknown, the effectiveness of the dosage level and
expected results when expired drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated.
The licensee must ensure that all medications are labeled with an expiration date.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* There was no record of inventory present on (unweaned) puppies born at the facility. No inventory information
was attached to 12 enclosures containing 54 (unweaned) puppies. In addition, the cage card information on 12
enclosures containing 44 (unweaned ) puppies did not have puppy identification, breed or the sex. Complete and
accurate records are needed to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability
to trace all puppies. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all puppies at their facility.
Correct by 7/2/15.
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The metal edging surrounding the entryway to five enclosures is corroded and showing excessive rust. In
addition, 21 wire enclosure gates are showing surface rust. In addition, eight galvanized divider panels are
corroded and showing excessive rust. Forty eight dogs are in contact with the affected areas located in outdoor and
indoor housing. The surfaces were rough in appearance. Rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces to the
point that the metal surfaces can no longer be readily cleaned and sanitized. In addition, excessive rust affects the
structural integrity of all metal surfaces. Licensee must ensure that all metal surfaces are free of excessive rust.
The licensee moved at least eight dogs to different enclosures during the inspection.3.1(c)(1)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The divider panel in one enclosure has broken, protruding wires with sharp points. One dog is in contact with the
affected wiring located in sheltered housing. Sharp points could injure the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosure wires be free of sharp points that might injure the animals. The licensee moved the dog to a different
enclosure during the inspection to correct this NCI.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, Kendall Lundy ACI and Robert Bacon
ACI.
