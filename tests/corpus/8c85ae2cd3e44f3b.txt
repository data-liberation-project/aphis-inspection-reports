ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:50pm on
28-Aug-19.
I arrived at the facility at 1:50pm. I knocked on the door and there was no answer. I called the phone number and
there was no answer. I waited an hour and no one came home. I left my business card at the door.
