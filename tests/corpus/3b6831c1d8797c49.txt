humane care and use of animals at least once every six months. The Animal Welfare Act should be used as a basis
for the evaluations. This semiannual evaluation is necessary to assess facility adherence to regulations and
standards and comply with the semiannual reporting requirement to the Institutional Official. In the future facility
program reviews must be conducted by the IACUC every six months.
