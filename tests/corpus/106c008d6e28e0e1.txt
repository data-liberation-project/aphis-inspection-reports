ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12 pm on

I spoke with Mr. Miller at the facility. He is recovering from major surgery and requested the inspection be
postponed.
