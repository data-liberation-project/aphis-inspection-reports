3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
According to facility representatives, on or around December 1 , 2020, a 2-year-old male Bennett's wallaby escaped the
facility. Immediately after escape, the animal had been successfully recaptured and placed back into the facility, but then
escaped again within a day. Despite representatives seeing the wallaby near the property intermittently for several
months, the wallaby was not able to be recaptured, and eventually, the wallaby was no longer seen as of Spring 2021.
Although no obvious fence holes were observed during the inspection, a facility representative commented that perhaps
the wallaby was able to exit through a small opening that was present at the corner of the facility. No structural changes
were made after the wallaby's escape.

In order to prevent injuries, hazards, and potentially life-threatening situations, animal housing facilities must be
structurally sound and maintained in good repair so the animals can be contained and protected.

The housing facilities for the wallabies must be made structurally sound and in good repair, to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
