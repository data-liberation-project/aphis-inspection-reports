2.31(c)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to inspect all facilities involved with animal care and use at least once every six
months. The IACUC is also responsible for ensuring non-compliant facility issues are repaired within a timely
manner. The following two facility issues were identified during this inspection.
" The ceiling between the two cage washers in the "dirty" wash room has peeling paint and what appears to be
damaged sheet rock. According to the licensee the steam from the large cage washer is not properly vented which
is causing the ceiling problems. The licensee explained that money has been budgeted for a new cage washer but
one has not been ordered and a definite repair date is somewhere in the future.
" Animal room 137 has an area of water damage on its ceiling.
All premises associated with animal care and use must be kept clean and in good repair in order to facilitate
required husbandry practices. An improperly vented cage washer is an improperly functioning cage washer which
may not be adequately cleaning cages. Chipping paint from the ceiling in the animal room could fall into an animal
cage causing health issues. The integrity of both of these ceilings is damaged which could allow rodents and other
pests entry into the facility. The cage washer needs to be replaced or repaired and both ceilings need to be
repaired.
