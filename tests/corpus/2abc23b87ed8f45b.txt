Indoor housing facilities.
Labrador Retrievers are being housed in indoor buildings with only open windows and fans being used for cooling. At the
beginning of the inspection (around 1:00 pm) the outside ambient temperature was 94 degrees F. The temperature in
the "New Building" was 91.8 F; the temperature in the "Small Building" was 89.3 F; and the temperature in the "Large
Building" was 89.7 F. The “Large Building” has air conditioning but it had not been used all summer, while the other two
buildings are not equipped with air conditioning. About 2 hours into the inspection, the air conditioning in the “Large
Building” was turned on. Four hours after the first temperature check, I rechecked the temperatures in the three buildings.
The “New Building” was 95.4 F, the “Small Building” was 93.7 F, and the “Large Building” was 86.4 F. Also, a female and
her eight 10-day-old puppies were housed in a garage with open doors and fans. The initial temperature in the garage
was 92.3 F and it was 94.6 F four hours later. While all the adult dogs were panting, none of the dogs or puppies had
signs of severe heat stress or stroke.

Excessive heat can cause problems ranging from decreased appetite and excessive panting to heat stroke and death.
The registrant must ensure that the temperature inside buildings housing dogs doesn’t rise above 85 F for more than 4
consecutive hours when dogs are present.



To be corrected by August 14, 2021. The registrant called an air conditioning company during the inspection to set up an
appointment.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
