3.125(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 15 May 2017 a female tiger escaped from an exercise enclosure in the rear area of the facility. The tiger was
discovered loose on the premises by an employee during evening feeding. The employee immediately retreated
and called an emergency code on the radio. No park visitors were present due to the late hour. The facility owner
and other employees responded immediately and located the tiger in a corner of the facility near the perimeter
fence. With her proximity to the perimeter fence, and the high danger if she was to escape the facility under cover
of darkness, the licensee made the decision to shoot and kill the animal. This was accomplished with a single
round from a rifle by the licensee.
The facility did not know how the tiger escaped from the pen. The enclosure is a common exercise yard in the
middle of multiple pens, recently built by the facility, and used by numerous animals in rotation. The fencing of the
enclosure meets current requirements for height on three sides. On the fourth side there was a narrow sheet metal
ledge along the inside of the fence. This ledge is actually the border of the metal roof of an adjacent set of pens
which extends through the exercise yard fence. The ledge is approximately a foot wide, and ten feet in height. The
facility has since removed this ledge, and there are no other obvious structural problems with the enclosure.
This was a focused inspection to address this specific incident. The exercise enclosure clearly failed to contain this
tiger. After her escape, the facility did react appropriately according to their emergency protocols. The facility also
immediately contacted their USDA inspector to self-report the incident. As mentioned, the facility removed the
sheet metal ledge following the focused inspection.
The facility must take all necessary steps to ensure the exercise enclosure and all other park enclosures are
sufficient to contain the animals.
Correct from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
