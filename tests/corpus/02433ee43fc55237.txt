ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***
A young male Rottweiler, ID#32315, was observed with an open wound on the end of his tail at the tail dock area.
The wound had a granular appearance around the outer edge and was open, reddened and inflamed in the inner
area of the wound. According to the licensee the puppy was held back two weeks ago because of this wound. The
licensee stated that he had been putting NuStock on the wound and it would close but then reopen. The licensee
has not consulted with a veterinarian for care or treatment on this wound. The unhealed wound could be a sign of a
medical condition that requires veterinary care. The licensee must have this puppy evaluated by a veterinarian for
an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate
veterinary care at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sanitization of food receptacles
***
The licensee has two large plastic barrels used for storage of open bags of food. On the inside wall of the food
barrels there is an accumulation of a dark sticky substance. On the underside area of the lid of one of the food
barrels there appears to be several dark spots which are consistent with fly spat. When questioned as to when was
the last time these barrels had been cleaned and sanitized the licensee could not remember. This accumulation of
the dark sticky substance and fly spat on the lids could become a disease hazard to the dogs. The licensee must
clean and sanitize these food storage barrels and ensure that primary enclosures, food and water receptacles are
cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta
and other disease hazards.
