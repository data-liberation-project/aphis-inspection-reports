**Three dogs had excessive matting of their haircoats. An adult male mixed breed dog named One-eyed Jack (no ID)
had excessive matting of the hair on his neck. A female Poodle named Ginger (no ID) had excessive matting on its hind
legs. A female Poodle named Cinnamon (no ID) had excessive matting on its back. Matted hair can result in skin and/or
eye problems, can be painful, and can compromise the haircoat's ability to provide protection from the heat or cold. The
registrant must remove the matted hair from this animal and must establish an effective program of haircoat maintenance.

**Three medications were past their expiration dates. These medications were in the storage area with the rest of the
medications. Tylan 50 expired June of 2018; Gentamicin Sulfate expired March of 2021; and 50% Dextrose expired
November of 2020. Expired medications may have lost their efficacy and ability to provide appropriate prevention or
treatment of medical problems. The registrant must ensure that all medications are within their expiration dates.

Records: Carriers and intermediate handlers.
The registrant did not have copies of health certificates for 60 dogs that she had transported in 2021. Copies of health
certificates are necessary to ensure that each dog delivered for transportation was examined by a veterinarian within 10


days and determined to be free of any infectious disease or physical abnormality that would endanger other animals or
public health. The registrant must keep and maintain copies of health certificates for each dog that is transported.

Primary enclosures.
Seven dogs in the holding facility did not have adequate floor space.
*A male Australian Shepherd (no ID) in pen #30 was 25 inches from his nose to the base of his tail. He required 6.67
square feet of floor space, but only had 4.0 square feet.
*A female Schnauzer (no ID) in pen #25 was 20 inches from her nose to the base of her tail. She required 4.69 square
feet of floor space, but only had 4.0 square feet.
*A female Poodle that was 15 inches long and a Havenese that was 15 inches long were housed together in pen #10.
They required a total of 6.12 square feet of space, but only had 3.5 square feet of floor space.
*A male mixed breed (no ID) in pen #6 was 19 inches long. He required 4.34 square feet, but only had 3.66 square feet
of floor space.
*Two poodles (no ID) housed together in pen #5 were each 16 inches long. They required 6.72 square feet of space, but
only had 3.66 square feet of floor space.

Adequate floor space is necessary to allow normal postural movements for the well-being and comfort of the dogs. The
registrant must ensure that each dog has adequate floor space when in the holding facility.

Primary enclosures.


Seven adult dogs in a total of five enclosures (pens #6, 10, 18, 25, and 30) in a holding facility only had 1-4 inches of
head space. Adequate head space is necessary to provide enough room for the dogs to comfortably make natural
postural movements. The registrant must ensure that the interior height of each primary enclosure is at least 6 inches
higher than the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position.
3.14(c)

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
The registrant accepted 40 dogs for transport in 2021 without the sellers certifying in writing that the dogs had been
offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the registrant for transport. This certification must also
include the identification of each dog. Without this certification, none of the 12 dogs currently in the holding facility had
any form of identification on themselves or on their enclosures. The registrant must not accept any dog for transport
unless the seller certifies in writing that the dog was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the
transporter and provides the dog's identification number.
