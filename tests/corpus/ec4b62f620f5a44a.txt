CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
In the adult dog building containing 68 dogs there is an excessive accumulation of feces underneath the enclosures
at the west end of the building. The accumulation of feces can cause odor problems, attract pests, and other
disease hazards. The feces must be removed from under the enclosures daily or as often as necessary to reduce
disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
