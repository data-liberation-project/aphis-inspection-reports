3.1(d) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Housing facilities must have access to reliable electric power for heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, and for
carrying out other requirements per the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) regulations. This facility has no means of
electric power. At the time of this inspection today the inside temperature of this facility was 92.6 degrees, the
outside temperature was 94 degrees. The owner must put into place and maintain the availability for access to a
form of electric power or method to be used when temperatures exceed the AWA regulations. A form of electric
power on a as needed basis can help ensure the good health of the dogs in this facility and help to maintain
husbandry standards.
3.3(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
When dogs are in this sheltered housing facility the ambient temperature must not fall below 45 degrees for more
than 4 consecutive hours or rise above 85 degrees for more than 4 consecutive hours. During this inspection
process today (08-24-16) the inside temperature of this facility, taken by my Kestrel 4000, was 92.6 degrees at 214
pm, outside temperature was 94 degrees. On the return visit today at 6 pm to conclude the inspection of this facility
the inside temperature of this facility was 91.8 at 614 pm. The outside temperature was 93 degrees. The owner
must develop a method (could be fans, air-conditioning, water misters, etc.) and ensure that the ambient
temperature does not exceed 85 degrees for more that 4 consecutive hours. Correctly controlling the temperature
in the sheltered facility will help provide for the dogs health and well-being. Correct by 08-27-2016 3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Enclosures and concrete runs that house dogs must be sanitized at least once every two week and more often if
needed to help prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, and stains. A good job of cleaning and sanitizing
enclosures and concrete runs can help to eliminate diseases and keep dogs healthy. The concrete runs need more
than the feces removed daily. The concrete runs need to be cleaned and sanitized as well to help remove feces
and urine stains. The owner must clean and sanitized all concrete runs where dogs are present to prevent
diseases, odors, and crusted feces.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on Aug 24, 2016
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility owner and Karl Thornton, ACI.
