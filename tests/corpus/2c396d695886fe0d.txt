REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
This SEARCH inspection was a focused inspection to verify the conduction of un-registered AWA Regulated activity
by Cabo Verde Airlines (aka “TACV”).
Information was received by APHIS Animal Care in November 2016 that Cabo Verde Airlines was transporting
animals into the Providence, RI airport housed inside kennels that were transported as cargo in the hold of the
planes. Although there were no animals in transit on the incoming flight or the outgoing flight on the day of the
inspection, several personnel at the Cabo Verde Airlines ticket counter acknowledged that dogs have in fact been
transported as cargo in kennels inside the hold of the planes on both incoming and outgoing flights through the
Providence airport.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the transportation of animals as cargo by air is an activity regulated by the
Animal Welfare Act and a valid USDA registration as a Class “T” carrier is required. Carriers that transport animals
as cargo must be registered with the USDA to ensure compliance with the transportation standards and to ensure
the welfare of the animals being transported.
The airline must complete the new registration form that will be sent by the Regional Office and then promptly return
it to the Eastern Regional Office for processing prior to any further transportation of animals by the airline.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID USDA REGISTRATION IS OBTAINED.
NOTE – Exit briefing held on-site 3/28/17 at the Providence airport ticket counter with representatives of the airline.
