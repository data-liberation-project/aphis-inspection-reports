ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 2 dogs that were very thin. The vertebrae, hips and ribs were easily seen. Each had a definite
abdominal tuck. The dogs had been treated with dewormer and their food changed to puppy food, however, the
dogs were still thin. Weight loss can be the result of parasites, lack of adequate nutrition, or an underlying medical
condition. The licensee must have these dogs evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment, must keep a
record of the treatment, and must have the records available to APHIS officials upon request.

COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
In one of the outdoor enclosures was a 3 month old Basset Hound puppy, a 4 month old Pug puppy, and a
Dachshund that was approximately a year old. Puppies that are housed with an adult dog that is not their dam
could become injured by the older dog or be kept away from food, water, and shelter. Puppies that are 4 months of
age or less may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs other than their dam or foster dam.
