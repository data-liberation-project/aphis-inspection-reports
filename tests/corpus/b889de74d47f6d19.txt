2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee no longer uses the services of her previous attending veterinarian as of July 2014. While the licensee
has chosen a new attending veterinarian, that veterinarian has not visited the facility nor completed a new program
of veterinary care. The regulated mammals have been without the services of an attending veterinarian for approx.
4 months.
You shall formalize an agreement with a veterinarian of your choice quickly if you no longer have an attending
veterinarian and not wait for 4 month's time. That veterinarian shall visit the facility, examine the animals, and
complete a program of veterinary care.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The kinkajou has been moved into a new outdoor enclosure. This chain link top was not fastened down leaving a
few small holes: one in the right rear top corner, & another on the top left side. During the inspection, this kinkajou
was seen outside of it's enclosure running on top of the adjacent bobcat cage. The bobcats were actively chasing
it.
The kinkajou door was closed. It is unsure of where the kinkajou was able to get out of the enclosure, but these two
areas cannot be ruled out. (The kinkajou was subsequently captured and placed inside the house temporilary).
Regardless, all enclosures shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to contain the animals
and protect them from injury
3.131(d)
SANITATION. There is a large fire ant mound (with thousands of fire ants) directly adjacent to the front fox/skunk enclosure. Many
of these fire ants were observed inside this enclosure. The areas taken up by these fire ants was approx. 20%-25%
of the floor space of this enclosure.
The licensee stated that she sprays the top of the mounds with a safe insecticide. This procedure alone is not
sufficient to reduce the fire ant populations.
These fire ants can bite and inflict pain and discomfort. This risk is increased due to the amount of floor space that
is being occupied by the fire ants. A safe & effective pest control shall be instituted to reduce the fire ants in and
around the enclosures. Consult with a professional pest control company if necessary.
