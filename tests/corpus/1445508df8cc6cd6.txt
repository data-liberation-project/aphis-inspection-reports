3.6(a)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
Two dogs are housed at night in an indoor area that serves as their primary enclosure and it has an electrical outlet with
power cords plugged into the wall that are within easy reach of the dogs.

Access to cords could result in electrical shock injuries. Primary enclosures for dogs must be free of any hazards that
could cause injury. The facility did remove the power cords during the inspection.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The following problems were identified with the perimeter fence at the zoo:

- Gaps underneath the fence measuring from 4" to 6". These were found underneath gates, and underneath chain-link
and vertical bar fencing. There were two areas that showed evidence of small animal traffic through the gap.

- Gaps in the fencing including at junctions between two different types of fencing, or at corners, and also there was
fencing that consisted of vertical metal bars, and the distance between the bars was 4" in width.



- Two areas of fencing were identified where the height of the fence was around 7', rather than the required 8' for facilities
that have dangerous animals.

Additionally at the red wolf facility there were two gates with 4" to 5" gaps underneath the gates.

The perimeter fence for facilities that house dangerous animals must be 8' in height on both sides of the fence. The
perimeter fence must keep people and animals from passing under or through the fence, and also act as secondary
containment for exhibit animals in the event that they were to escape their enclosures. Failure to maintain the perimeter
fence up to these standards could put the exhibit animals at risk of escape, and of exposure to unauthorized visitors,
including animals that could transmit disease or cause injury.
