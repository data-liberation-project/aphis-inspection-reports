3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
A number of enclosures were in disrepair or constructed in a manner that could cause injury to the dogs. An enclosure
containing a 4 month old dog had a post that was broken and dislodged from the ground. This post is what the door gate
latches onto. The dog in this enclosure was able to stick its head in between the post and the wall. To get its head out, it
had to pull somewhat forcibly. This is a potential safety hazard as the dog could potentially get its head stuck in between
this post and the wall. The dog in this enclosure either needs to be removed from this enclosure or the post needs to be
fixed so the dog can't get its head in between the post and the wall.

An enclosure containing a female dog and seven puppies had part of the back wall that had a chewed up hole in the wall.
The chewed up part could cause an injury if the dog in that enclosure continues to chew the wall. In addition, the wall
cannot be easily sanitized and cleaned in the condition it is in. The dogs in this enclosure either need to be moved to
another enclosure or that section of the wall needs to be fixed.

An outdoor enclosure containing four adult dogs had an overhang on the top of the fencing to prevent the dogs from
climbing over the fencing. Some bars at the top ended at a point which could result in an injury to the dog should they rub
their head or eyes up against this part of the fencing. The dogs in this enclosure either needs to be moved to another

enclosure or the fencing needs to be fixed so there are no sharp points protruding out.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
Hutch-like shelters within the outdoor dog enclosures only get cleaned out once a year. When the licensee opened the
door to one of the hutch-like shelters, there was debris on the flooring and it appeared to be dirty. Not properly sanitizing
these shelters every two weeks increases the risk of the spread of disease. All shelters located within the outdoor
enclosures must be sanitized once every two weeks. Correct by 10/10/22.
3.9(b)

Feeding
A food container for an enclosure containing six dogs was chewed up. A chewed up food container can't be easily
cleaned and sanitized. The food container needs to be replaced or repaired so it can be easily sanitized. Correct by
10/3/22.
3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The licensee informed me he never removes the excreta from the outdoor primary enclosures. Not removing the excreta
on a daily basis in unsanitary and contributes to the spread of disease. Excreta must be removed from all outdoor
enclosures on a daily basis. Correct by 9/27/22.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.

Rabies shots have not been given to any of the adult dogs. Not vaccinating against rabies doesn't ensure the dogs are
adequately protected from the disease. The licensee must get all adult dogs vaccinated against rabies. Correct by
10/24/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

End of report.
