ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A female Chihuahua (#941000013547671) had overgrown toenails. Some of the nails on the paws, especially
two on outside digits, had grown so long that they had curled around and were approaching the pads of the feet.
Overgrown nails can cause changes in gait and stance and increase the risk of discomfort. The licensee must
develop and establish an effective nail trimming schedule as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the
animals in the facility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. To be
corrected by: November 8, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility representative.
