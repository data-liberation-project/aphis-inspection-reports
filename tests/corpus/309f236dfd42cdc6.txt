Records: Operators of auction sales and brokers.
The APHIS Forms 7005 that the licensee was using to maintain records were missing some of the required information.
For example, there were two dogs missing a USDA approved form of identification. Also, USDA license numbers were
missing for at least five licensed persons from whom animals were received. Complete and accurate records are required
for tracking and tracing purposes. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly
disclose the required information concerning each animal.
3.3(e)(1)(ii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
A sheltered facility contains wooden blocks which are not impervious to moisture within the outside portion of the
enclosures. The wooden blocks are located at the entrances of the in/out access doors within at least three enclosures
housing dogs and function as steps for the dogs to go in and out of the building. These wooden blocks could allow water
to be soaked into them. Surfaces which are not impervious to moisture increase the risk that they are not able to be
properly cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces not properly cleaned and sanitized can increase the risk of disease hazards.
The licensee must ensure that outdoor floor areas in contact with animals, when the floor areas are not exposed to the
direct sun, or are made of a hard material such as wire, wood, metal, or concrete are impervious to moisture at all times.


3.6(c)(1)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
There was a primary enclosure housing an adult female Yorkshire Terrier with five newborn puppies that did not have the
required amount of minimum floor space. The primary enclosure measured 24x20 inches, providing a total of 3.33 square
feet of floor space. The adult female measured 15 inches in length and, if housed by herself, would require 3.06 square
feet of floor space. A dam with puppies requires an additional amount of floor space that provides each nursing puppy
with at least five percent of the minimum floor space requirement for the dam. Therefore, the five puppies each require
0.15 square feet of additional floor space. The total amount of floor space required for the dam and her five puppies is 3.8
square feet, however, the enclosure only provided 3.3 square feet. Each bitch with nursing puppies must be provided with
the minimum amount of floor space in their primary enclosures as required in this section in order to ensure their comfort,
health, and well-being. The licensee must ensure that all animals have access to at least the minimum floor space
required by this section at all times.
