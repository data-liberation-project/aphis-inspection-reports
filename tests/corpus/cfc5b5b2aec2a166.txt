SANITATION.
The outdoor housing area where two hairy armadillos are present, has an accumulation of empty feed sacks and
other discarded materials. Chickens and other birds that have access to the area, are roosting and defecating on
the surfaces where the armadillos' enclosure is located.
The licensee stated that he would move the armadillos to an indoor housing facility.
Unsanitary living conditions exist if the affected areas are not kept clean. Accumulations of trash should be placed in
designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. The licensee must ensure that all
buildings and grounds are kept clean to facilitate required husbandry practices.
