FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chain link fencing for the pig enclosure was not completely attached to the bottom horizontal support bar,
creating a gap. The pig was observed sticking its head through the hole. This condition can possibly cause injury
to the animal. Enclosures must be maintained in proper repair in order to safely contain the animals and protect
them from injury. The licensee corrected the issue and fixed the fence before the inspector left the facility.
***********Corrected at the time of inspection
Exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
