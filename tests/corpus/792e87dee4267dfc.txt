ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One brown female miniature bulldog with collar ID 186-368 has a white opaque circular lesion in both eyes that
obscure the inner structures of the eye. The lesion in the left eye is both raised and contains areas of pigment.
These ocular abnormalities indicate illness. Appropriate methods must be used to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to diagnose and treat this dog.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Eleven enclosures with puppies were loaded in the transport vehicle. Of the eleven enclosures, seven contained
more than 4 puppies:
Enclosure #2 contained five small breed puppies.
Enclosure #4 contained eight small breed puppies and was too crowded. The puppies did not have enough room to
make normal postural adjustments without bumping into each other.
Enclosure #5 contained eight small breed puppies and was too crowded. The puppies did not have enough room to
make normal postural adjustments without bumping into each other.
Enclosure #7 contained five small breed puppies.
Enclosure #9 contained five small breed puppies under slightly cramped conditions.

Enclosure #10 contained nine large breed puppies (Labrador retrievers and German shepherds). The pups were
severely overcrowded and could not move without stepping on and over each other.Enclosure #11 contained six small breed puppies under slightly cramped conditions.
Transporting too many puppies together in one enclosure increases their stress and puts them at higher risk for
injury and disease. No more than four dogs of comparable size may be transported in the same primary enclosure.

PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
Inside a white Enterprise cargo van, there are 11 cages with dogs not securely placed. Three of the cages were
placed on top of another cage with one of those cages being tilted and askew. The driver said he thought the one
cage shifted from backing up the van. There is nothing restricting the cages from moving freely inside the van and
the cages could easily move, slide, tilt, and turnover. The cages do not ensure the safety and comfort of the
animals. The primary enclosures of all dogs in transportation need to be securely placed to prevent injuries and
guarantee the welfare of the dogs.
