Multiple animals were observed to have veterinary care issues during the inspection. Most of the animals with
veterinary care issues had not been observed to have these issues prior to inspection. This has resulted inveterinary care issues going untreated. A daily observation process needs to be put in place so veterinary care
issues can be immediately identified and treated per the Attending Veterinarian's instructions.
