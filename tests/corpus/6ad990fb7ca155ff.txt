2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is no program of veterinary care. The licensee stated that his daughter had it with the court papers. I asked
that he fax or email it by the end of the week. I still have not received it and therefore do not know if the plan is
being followed as written by the attending veterinarian.
Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian. In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian the formal
arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the
exhibitor.
Have your veterinarian complete a program of veterinary care to ensure that the wolf is receiving proper routine
veterinary care and that the veterinarian is available for emergency veterinary care.
