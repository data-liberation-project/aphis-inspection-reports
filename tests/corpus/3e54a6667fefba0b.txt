2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 pm on
12-APR-17.
I called the contact number for the license holder, knocked on the facility door, and honked the vehicle horn upon
arrival at the facility. All attempts to contact the license holder were unsuccessful. I sat in the facility driveway for
30 minutes before leaving.
A responsible person shall be available to accompany the inspection during business hours.
