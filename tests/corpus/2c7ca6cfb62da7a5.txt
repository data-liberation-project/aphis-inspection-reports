2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The black and white female goat in the third pen from the entrance has
excessively long hooves, especially on the front feet. The lateral hoof on both front feet are curled up and inward.
Overgrown hooves may cause foot problems and lameness. The feet must be trimmed to prevent discomfort and to
maintain the health of the animal.

FEEDING.
Section 3.82(a) Feeding: Dry cat food filled the food dish for the marmoset. Once the APHIS official identified the
diet, the facility escort/animal caretaker removed the cat food. The marmoset was given canned marmoset diet,
primate food pellets and a small amount of banana. Feeding animals an inappropriate diet may cause nutritional
imbalances and lead to health problems. The marmoset must be fed a diet appropriate for its species, size, age
and condition of the animal, and for the conditions in which the nonhuman primate is maintained, according to
generally accepted professional and husbandry practices and nutritional standards. Correct from this day forward.
Note: The capuchin cited on the January 28, 2016 inspection report was seen and treated by the attending
veterinarian.
An exit briefing was conducted with the animal caretaker.
