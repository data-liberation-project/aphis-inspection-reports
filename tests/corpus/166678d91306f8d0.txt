Sanitation.
*** There was an excessive number of flies in both guinea pig enclosures hovering around the animals and food. The
licensee has one fly strip hanging up, but it doesn’t seem to be effective for pest control with the current number of flies in
the room. The licensee needs to address this, so the pest control program is effective at controlling and reducing the
number of flies for the comfort of the animals.

Facilities, indoor.
*** The rabbit has a primary enclosure but is also able to leave the enclosure and move around a room with several other
species. The rabbit has been actively chewing at the back wall and has chewed paint and drywall away. This can be an
ingestion hazard and this section of wall is no longer impervious to moisture which impacts the ability for the room to be
effectively cleaned and sanitized. This needs to be addressed to facilitate cleaning of the room and for the safety of the
rabbit.

Facilities, general.

*** The wire chinchilla enclosure housing three chinchillas has broken wires at the ramp area and on a shelf. The wires
are protruding into the enclosure which can be a safety issue for the animals and affects the structural integrity of the
enclosure. This enclosure needs to be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals.

Sanitation.
*** The blue rabbit enclosure is filled with feces that need to be removed. The animal can leave the enclosure and move
around the room, but the accumulation of feces contributes to a strong odor in the area. This enclosure should be cleaned
more frequently to reduce this accumulation.

Sanitation.
*** The rabbit has the ability to move around a room where two chinchilla enclosures are placed on the ground. The
chinchilla enclosures have no solid floor and there are chinchilla and reptile feces directly on the tile where the rabbit has
access as it moves around the area. The premises where the rabbit is housed should be kept clean to facilitate good
housekeeping practices.

Sanitation.
*** The hedgehog enclosure needs to be cleaned. The wheel is covered with feces and the tile floor is dirty and stained
with feces. There is no bedding available to soak up urine and feces and there is limited area where the animal can walk
and stay clean.

*** The chinchilla enclosures are also dirty and need to be cleaned. There is dust and debris throughout the wire mesh
and the floor is dirty and stained with feces. These enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis.
Cleaning for these species must be done as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize
disease hazards and reduce odors.
