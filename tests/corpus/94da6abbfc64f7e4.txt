2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***DIRECT. A female Yorkshire Terrier (4943133E1A) was exhibiting a green, crusty discharge on the edges of the
eyelids of the left eye. Upon closer examination of the eye, the surface of the eye appeared dry and the entire
conjunctiva was red. The licensee was not aware of the eye problem and had not consulted a veterinarian about it.
Eye conditions may cause pain and discomfort to the dog, can worsen quickly and can result in a permanent lesion
or even blindness if left untreated. The licensee shall have the dog examined by a licensed veterinarian regarding
the condition, document the diagnosis and execution of any treatments. All documentation must be available for
review upon future inspection.
TO BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 4, 2017.
*** Some of the dogs were exhibiting some soiling of the hair coat around the eyes, mouth, inguinal area, and
rectum. The three month old puppies had balls of fecal material attached to the hair coat around the anus. An adult
Maltese female had dark matting along the muzzle, around both eyes and on her jaw. The soiling of the hair coat
may cause underlying skin issues, blockage of the rectum and adverse medical conditions if left unattended.
Licensee shall implement a proactive grooming regimen to prevent soiling of the dogs.
