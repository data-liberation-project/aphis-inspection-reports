SANITATION.
***There were tall weeds and/or grass surrounding many of the animals' enclosures. Some of the weeds and grass
located adjacent to potions of the wolves' enclosure reached at least 3-4 feet in height. Tall weeds and grass can
harbor insects, rodents and vermin which can increase the risk of disease in the animals. The licensee must keep
the premises clean and in good repair in order to protect the health of the animals and to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices at the facility at all times. To be corrected by: June 5, 2017.
