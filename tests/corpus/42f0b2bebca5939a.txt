FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wooden stall door in one outdoor enclosure ("IP stall") has 4 inch vertical gaps on both outer edges of the door.
These vertical gaps create a space where the three animals housed in this pen (one adult female goat and two
young mouflon) could potentially become injured by entrapping a leg or foot. Outdoor housing facilities must be
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To

by vermin such as in a container with a tightly fitting lid. To be corrected by: August 7, 2015.
