ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) has not been reviewed since 8/2012. The PVC states that a fecal exam for
parasites will be done annually, but it has not been done at that frequency.
Following the PVC as developed by the Attending Veterinarian (AV) in conjunction with the licenssee is important to
ensure the health and well-being of the animal.
Correct by following up with the AV and updating the PVC by 3/14/2014.
The animal was not on exhibit at the time of inspection.
The inspection was accompanied by a facility representative. The exit briefing was conducted with both licensees.
