ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30pm on
28-Mar-18.
I arrived at the home at 2:25pm and knocked on the door. No one answered. I called the only number in the file and
it was no longer in service. I waited for 30 minutes. When I was leaving at 2:55pm, I stopped at another home on
the same driveway belonging to the licensee's mother. I left my business card with her and requested that the
licensee call me to give me his new phone number.
