ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:45 pm on

While at the facility, talked to a family member who let me know the licensee wouldn't be available till later that
night.
