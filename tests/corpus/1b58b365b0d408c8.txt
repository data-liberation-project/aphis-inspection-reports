2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An approximately 1 1/2 year old female Golden Retriever (#71) was holding up her left front leg while standing and
sitting and also favored the left front leg while walking. On closer observation, the fourth digit on the left front foot
appeared abnormal compared to the rest of the digits. The tissue surrounding the nail was firm and appeared
enlarged/swollen and reddened with an overall mass-like appearance. The redness of the skin was more significant
on the inside portion of the toe and the fur was darker red in this area. The nail appeared to be pushed to the side
and/or growing at an angle. The pad beneath the toe was also irregular in appearance. There was a hole-like
lesion on the top of the pad, just beneath the nail, where it appeared like a section of the pad was missing. The
edges of the pad's tissue in this area were irregular. The pad was also a reddish pink color closest to the lesion and
a yellowish discharge-like material was noted along the edge of this lesion on the pad. The licensee had recently
hosed down the concrete in the enclosure and the dog's entire foot was wet. When asked at the beginning of the
inspection if any of the dogs were under veterinary care, the licensee replied "no". According to the licensee this
dog had been seen by a veterinarian but couldn't remember when. When asked if this dog was currently receiving
treatment the licensee replied "no" and she said she could not remember what she had given for treatment.
According to written documentation provided by the licensee at the facility, the dog was examined by a veterinarian
on March 22, 2015. Treatment recommendations were given at that time and included to "soak or scrub" and to
give "Amoxicillin twice daily for at least 14 days". Also included on the veterinarian documentation was: "Dx
possible nail bed infection or possible tumor". According to the licensee, she would see the dog favor the foot off
and on. Although this dog was examined by a veterinarian in March (approximately 6 months ago), the dog is
currently not receiving treatment and is currently showing signs of discomfort. This dog's condition could be due to
injury, infection and/or another veterinary medical condition which could be painful. The licensee must have this
animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an
appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate
veterinary care at all times.
