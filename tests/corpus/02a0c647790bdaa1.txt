3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Kennels 7,4,5,3, and 19 have rusty door wire that needs to be replaced. Rusting wire can break and produce sharp
edges that could harm the dogs and rust prevents proper cleaning and sanitizing of the runs. A regular program of
maintenance needs to be in place and followed.

3.3(e)(1)(3)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Kennels 1-7 and 12-19 all have surfaces that are no longer impervious to moisture. This prevents the proper
cleaning and sanitizing of the runs and provides places for molds, mildew, and parasites to grow. These runs need
to be sealed to make them impervious to moisture. A regular program of keeping all surfaces moisture proof needs
to be in place and followed.

3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The kennel has an exercise yard and follows a regular exercise program for the dogs at the kennel. However, this
exercise program is not documented in written form or signed by the attending veterinarian. Regulations require
that kennels have a written program of exercise that has been reviewed and signed by the attending veterinarian.
Exercise provides dogs with the ability to run and play which improves overall health and socialization.
