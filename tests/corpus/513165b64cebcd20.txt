ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Four dogs had problems with their eyes. A female Golden Retriever (Animal ID #3) was squinting with both eyes.
Both eyes had a mucous discharge. The eyes were clearly bothering the dog. The licensee stated that the
Attending Veterinarian has not seen the dog since last year. Another female Golden Retriever (Animal ID #7) also
had a mucous discharge coming from both eyes. The right eye was worse than the left eye. A third female Golden
Retriever (Animal ID #6) also had a mucous discharge coming from both eyes. The left eye was the worse of the
two. A fourth female Golden Retriever (Animal ID #5) had a white spot on her left eye. She was squinting a little
and also had a little bit of mucous discharge coming from her eyes, although it wasn't as much as first three dogs.
Eye problems can be painful and can indicate underlying health problems that may be contagious to other animals.
The licensee must ensure that these animals are evaluated and treated per the Attending Veterinarian's
instructions.
