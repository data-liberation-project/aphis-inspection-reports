3.26(d)

Facilities, indoor.
There were several window frames and ceiling support beams with exposed bare wood not sealed or painted.
Bare wood is not impervious to moisture and cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards
for the guinea pigs.
Interior building surfaces must be constructed and maintained so that they are impervious to moisture, can be readily
cleaned and sanitized, and won’t absorb moisture or odors.
