degrees F at the time of inspection (about 10:30 am). The temperature in the new round sheltered building is 49.7
degrees F. The heat was not turned on in these buildings over night and only the screen door was closed on the
round building allowing airflow into the building. When searching for the licensee's zip code in noaa.gov, the
recorded low temperature last night was 38 degrees F. There a bean-bag bed in one enclosure in the large dog

poodle and golden-doodle housed within it. Lack of adequate head spaces limits the ability of the dogs to make
postural adjustments and move freely. The licensee must ensure that the interior height of a primary enclosure must
be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position.
One dog was moved from this enclosure at the time of inspection. To be corrected by 28 April 2017.
