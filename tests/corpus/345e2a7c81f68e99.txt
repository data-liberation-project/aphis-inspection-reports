Study activities continued on a study despite the fact that the amendment that covered the study activities had
expired. Protocol 15-022 expired on March 3, 2018 and was not reviewed and approved until March 6, 2018. The
individual study protocol under the above umbrella protocol approved for 25 animals also expired on March 3, 2018
and was not reviewed and approved until March 8, 2018. A modification adding five additional animals to the
individual study was approved October 17, 2017 and expired on March 3, 2018. This modification had not been
reviewed and approved at the time of the inspection.
Correct from this time forward.
2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Results of abnormal nonhuman primate (NHP) blood work were never conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The
blood work was run by the facility and provided to the client PI as part of the study, but not communicated to the
veterinarian. The animal was later euthanized because of significant health issues.
NHP 13-1646R developed diarrhea and had abnormal blood work findings. Blood work conducted on this animal
was not reported to the attending veterinarian. During the time that this animal’s clinical issues were being pursued,
the veterinarian did not have access to relevant blood work results. The animal’s condition continued to deteriorate,
and it was euthanized two weeks later.
Failing to notify the attending veterinarian of clinical issues and abnormal medical test results in a timely manner
may have a negative impact on animal health. The facility should ensure that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health are promptly conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.Additional Inspectors
