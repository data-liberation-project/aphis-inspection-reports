RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee has not been keeping any puppy records that properly identify each puppy born in order to trace them
back to the female or dates sold. There is not adequate record keeping of the births and sales of the puppies at the
facility. The Inventory (7005) forms are missing the address information on the all of the animals, including several
ID numbers/names. There have been 3 litters sold that do not have any Disposition (7006) records filled out.
Complete and proper records are required for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
All records of inventory animals should be kept on the 7005 forms with complete ID numbers/names and full
addresses of who they were purchased from. All animals sold/donated/transferred that leave the property should be
on a Disposition (7006) record, with all pertinent information provided on the documents.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are 4 German Shepard runs that have an excessive buildup of feces spread around the cement floor and
wires, which has resulted in the dogs feet and legs being covered with feces in varying degrees. While they are spot
cleaned daily, these 4 runs need to be cleaned more frequently due to the amount of feces buildup daily and due to
the behavior of the dogs. In order to prevent the spreading of feces on all of the surfaces and dogs themselves, the
runs need to be cleaned more than once a day. There is a wooden structure that houses 6 Beagles and 1 pug that
has 3 months buildup of feces under the slatted floor, which has resulted in the debris being within5- 6 inches of the
dogs floor, under their feeding and sleeping area.
The buildup of feces within the enclosure and under the outdoor pen can be a source of bacteria and disease that is
in direct contact with the regulated animals. This can become a possible health hazard for the dogs if not cleaned
frequently enough to prevent the buildup under the pens, or within the runs that allows for the dogs to walk and lay
down in the debris. The buildup of feces under the wooden kennel is a source of possible disease due to increasedflies and vermin that can inhabit that area in close proximity to the dogs. There is no way for the dogs to get away
from that area as it builds up over weeks or months.
The licensee must clean out the run areas more than once a day for those animals that are spreading their feces
throughout the kennel, causing them to become covered with feces on the feet, legs and belly. The outdoor kennel
with the beagles needs to have the catchment area cleaned out more often that once every 3 months. There should
not be feces buildup within inches of the regulated animals flooring for weeks at a time.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Currently the licensee is only sanitizing once per month the surfaces coming in contact with the dogs, and food and
water receptacles. There were several feeders that had a buildup of black debris or hair inside of the feeders that
need to be sanitized more frequently.
It is important to sanitize at least once per 2 weeks, or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime
and to decrease the potential for disease, bacteria and parasite exposure.
The licensee must increase their sanitization to at least once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the
buildup of feces, dirt and grime on any surface the dogs come in contact with, including food and water receptacles.
