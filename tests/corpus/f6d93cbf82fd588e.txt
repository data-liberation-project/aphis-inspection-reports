2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC's semi-annual animal facility inspection and program review was conducted on an interval of greater
than six months. The previous two inspections were conducted on 23 August 2013 and 8 May 2014 respectively.
This interval is approximately 8.5 months between inspections. Also, the report that was submitted to the
Institutional Official did not contain a reasonable and specific plan to correct identified deficiencies, nor did it contain
scheduled correction dates. In order to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act standards, reports of the
IACUC's evaluations of the program for humane care and use of animals and the research facility's animal facilities
must be prepared and updated at least once every 6 months upon completion of the required semiannual
evaluation, and must contain both a reasonable and specific plan for correction of deficits, and a schedule of
correction deadlines.
