3.75(a) Critical

Housing facilities, general.
On August 6th 2021, a two year old female rhesus macaque was found dead in an outdoor compound. Her body was
found with the lower left leg trapped inside a gap on the wall 8 feet above ground, near the door leading to the indoor
area. The gap was created at the junction where two panels of sheet metal overlapped horizontally and were attached to
the concrete wall. The facility’s internal investigation concluded that the primate's death resulted from having her leg
trapped in the wall gap. This enclosure was not constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
juvenile rhesus macaque. Housing facilities for non-human primates must be designed and constructed so that they are
structurally sound to safely contain the species of non-human primates housed in them. At the time of inspection,
corrective actions and preventative measures had been implemented.
3.75(f)

Housing facilities, general.
Approximately 14 outdoor enclosures housing rhesus macaques had an excess build-up of food waste under and around
the self-feeders.
- In the S1 compound, a layer of disintegrated food waste coated the concrete located below the biscuit feeding platform.
A white fuzzy film of mold-like substance was seen overlaid over the food waste and staining the concrete beneath.


- In the S7 compound, a large amount of food waste was seen accumulating in the trenches located around the perimeter
of the outdoor space. In the trench, spanning the length between the two biscuit feeding platforms and beyond, a large
amount of disintegrated primate biscuits mixed in with leftover enrichment items was accumulating. A thick layer of
greyish white mold-like material was seen covering the food waste creating a uniform mass.
- Other enclosures similarly had a large amount of food waste accumulating in the trenches around the perimeter. In one
compound in particular, the waste accumulation was preventing the drainage of standing rainwater from the previous day.
During this inspection, numerous flies were seen over the accumulation of food waste. Primates were also seen
interacting and sitting on the accumulated waste. According to the husbandry staff, the food waste was last removed
during the previous cleaning approximately 3 to 4 weeks ago. The accumulation of old food provides an area for pest
reproduction which can cause irritations to the nonhuman primates. Furthermore, the nonhuman primates may come into
contact with or possibly consume the moldy food. Housing facilities must provide for regular and frequent collection,
removal and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead animals, debris, garbage, water and any other fluids and
wastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risk. A plan for more frequent removal of the food waste
must be established. To be corrected by November 8th, 2021.
3.84(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
During inspection, the following areas in need of cleaning and repair were found:
- The AC vent located above the food prep table in the kitchen was coated entirely by an accumulation of dust and other
contaminants. Additionally, the openings of AC ducts in several behavioral procedure rooms and indoor enclosures were
observed to be significantly coated by a buildup of dust, dirt and/or other filtrates.
- Some blackened food waste was found wedged in two corners of a food trailer used to store food for the non-human
primates.


- In an indoor room housing rhesus macaque, the metal grate covering the AC duct had come almost completely loose
and was coming apart.
These areas are not being maintained in a manner that protects animal health and welfare. Facilities must be kept clean
and in good repair in order to protect the non-human primates from injury, to facilitate the required husbandry practices
and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents, pests and vermin.
To be corrected by October 9th 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
