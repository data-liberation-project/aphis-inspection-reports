ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* There was a capuchin with large patches of complete hair loss on its back. The licensee stated the animal had the
hairloss when he purchased it a few weeks earlier. The licensee was told by the previous owner that the animal's
hair was pulled out by its cage mates. This animal has been housed with at least three other nonhuman primates
since it arrived at the licensee's facility yet has not been examined by a veterinarian yet.
** The hair loss on this animal could be due to parasites or some other medical condition which could be transmitted
to the other primates in its enclosure.
*** The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian so appropriate diagnostics and an
accurate diagnosis and treatment plan can be determined. The licensee should appropriately quarantine new
animals and have them examined by a veterinarian when necessary. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 12 May 2014.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* On 2 May 2014, a male capuchin escaped its enclosure and then the building where it was housed. The animal
was chased around the town for approximately 7 hours. According to the licensee, at least once he came within 10
feet of the animal but was unable to capture it. Throughout the day, the licensee tried five times to tranquilize the
animal with a pistol air gun. All five times the licensee missed. According to the licensee, he had never used the
tranquilizer gun before and did not know how to use it. Since the licensee was unable to successfully tranquilize the
animal, it eventually had to be shot and killed by law enforcement due to public safety concerns.
** Being familiar and trained with emergency equipment, such as a tranquilizer gun, is critical to prevent more
extreme measures from needing to be taken when animals escape.
*** The licensee must ensure that adequate guidance and training are provided to personnel involved in the care
and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, and tranquilization. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 23 May 2014.3.75(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* On 2 May 2014, there was a male capuchin which managed to escape its enclosure when the licensee opened it
to swap out enrichment items. The licensee stated it is fairly common for the primates to escape when he has to
open their enclosures. According to the licensee, "maybe every fifth time" an animal will manage to escape and he
will have to catch it and return it to its enclosure. After the capuchin escaped its enclosure on 2 May 2014, it also
managed to also escape the building through an air vent. The air vent was covered with a wire mesh, except there
was an intentional tear in the mesh to allow a pipe to pass through. This tear left an opening in the wire mesh which
was approximately 7 inches tall by 2 inches wide and could be opened further. The animal was able to quickly
escape through that opening and was then running loose in the town. After being chased for approximately 7 hours,
the capuchin was eventually shot and killed by law enforcement due to public safety concerns.
** Buildings housing exotic animals, such as nonhuman primates, should be maintained so that they contain the
animals securely to prevent the animals from escaping into the public where they become a threat to people and
themselves. This security of the building is especially important when the facility has a history of animals escaping
enclosures repeatedly.
*** The licensee must ensure that all buildings housing the nonhuman primates contain the animals securely. This
non-compliant item was corrected prior to the inspection.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There was one enclosure on the far end of the warehouse which had a large, white rope hanging from the top
which was soiled brown. There were enrichment items in the animal housing room which have not been used for
some time according to the licensee. Those items were not clean and appeared to have rodent feces collected in
them. There was also a carrier on the ground in the animal housing room, just a few feet away from some of the
primate enclosures, which had also not been used for some time, according to the licensee. That carrier was soied
with fecal material and organic debris. The sink in the animal housing room which is used to clean the food and
water receptacles and the enrichment items was not clean and had a build-up of organic debris near the faucet.
** Unsanitary conditions in the housing area can lead to disease transmission.
***The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to
satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 16 May 2014.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES. * On 2 May 2014, there was a male capuchin which managed to escape its enclosure when the licensee opened it
to swap out enrichment items. The licensee stated it is fairly common for the primates to escape when he has to
open their enclosures. According to the licensee, "maybe every fifth time" an animal will manage to escape and he

managed to also escape the building. After being chased for approximately 7 hours throughout the town, the
capuchin was eventually shot and killed by law enforcement due to public safety concerns.
** Exotic animals, such as nonhuman primates, which are not contained securely in their enclosures at all times
pose a safety risk to both themselves and their caretakers.
*** The licensee must ensure tht all enclosures are constructed and maintained to keep the animals contained
securely. This is a REPEAT non-compliant item.
The inspection was conducted on 8 May 2014 with the licensee. An exit interview was conducted on 9 May 2014
with the licensee.
