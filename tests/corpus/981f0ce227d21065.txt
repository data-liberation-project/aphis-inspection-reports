ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1545 on
09-Apr-18. I went to the licensee's house. A relative informed me he was not home. The relative informed me of
where I could find him. I tracked the licensee down, but he was working and was not able to leave to conduct the
inspection. I told him I would try back another time.
End of report.
