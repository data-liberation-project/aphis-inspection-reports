2.126(a)(4) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
During this inspection the inspector was prevented from gathering the evidence needed to evaluate the facility. After
receiving numerous verbal challenges from members of the public and from employees of this licensee about taking
videos of the handling of animals during the auction, one individual purposely stood between the inspector and the
animals so as to block the ability to take videos during this inspection.
Interfering with the inspection process by blocking the video taping of areas of non-compliance hinders the inspectors
ability to enforce the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). This operator of an auction must allow APHIS officials to inspect and
photograph ( to include video) the facilities, property and animals as they consider necessary to enforce the provisions of
the act, the regulations and the standards of the AWA.

Correct from this date forward.
2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
A ring-tailed lemur was handled inappropriately during the auction. During the auction, an individual in the auction arena
attempted to remove the lemur from its travel enclosure. This individual was holding the enclosure in one hand and
attempting to pull the lemur out of the enclosure by its tail. The lemur resisted coming out of the cage, so the individual

held the lemur’s tail and preceded to pull harder. Again, the lemur resisted even more by grabbing both sides of the
enclosure with its forefeet. Finally, after the individual gave one last hard pull the lemur came out of the enclosure. While
this was happening, the enclosure was observed shaking.
Rough and inappropriate handling of animals can result in stress, injury, and trauma. All facility personnel must handle all
animals as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive
cooling, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

Correct from this date forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
