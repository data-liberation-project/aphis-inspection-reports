2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC completed facility inspections on August 24th 2017. No completed semi-annual evaluation reports have
been sent to the Institutional Official. It is important to involve the Institutional Official in the IACUC's evaluations of
the research facility and to inform them of the status of the facility's programs to allow the Institutional Official to
follow up on correction of significant deficiencies. This ensures that appropriate authority can be exercised by the
Institutional Official when needed to support the facility's continued humane care and use of animals. The IACUC
must prepare reports based on the facility program review and inspection, update them every six months, submit
them to the Institutional Official in a timely fashion, and have them available for inspection by APHIS officials.
Correct by December 7th 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Program Director.
