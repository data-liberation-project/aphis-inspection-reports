HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Upon the inspection of the room that houses the deer mice, this inspector noticed a small weanling mouse on the
floor in this room. This mouse was quickly captured and appeared in good health with no signs of dehydration,
emaciation, or injury.
It was postulated that when a group of mice were being transferred into another larger enclosure, this one somehow
jumped out of the cage and went unnoticed by the PI's assistant.
Implement a system to ensure that all of the animals are accounted for when they are being transferred to another
cage so this does not occur in the future which would minimize stress and potential harm to these mice.
