Recordkeeping requirements.
The research facility acquired a total of 12 dogs from an unlicensed person and there is not a certification from the
unlicensed person stating the animals were born and raised on the person's premises and that the person has sold fewer
than 25 dogs and/or cats that year. This certification is required to ensure that the dogs are being obtained from a legal
source and that random source dogs are not being used for research purposes. If dogs or cats are acquired from any
person not licensed or registered under the Act and not a pound or shelter, the research facility must obtain a certification
that the animals were born and raised on the person's premises and that the person has sold fewer than 25 dogs and/or
cats that year.
