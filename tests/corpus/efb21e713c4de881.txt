HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Stripping paint was observed on the walls of five housing units for the chimpanzees. One housing unit had chipping
and peeling paint observed outside on a vent hood's surface, which was situated over a temporary food holding
station. All of the five housing units had rows of stripping paint observed below and around the windows of the
outer enclosure for chimpanzee indoor housing. One housing unit, Doug's Island, had stripping paint observed
inside the indoor housing enclosure for the chimps.
Chipping and peeling paint can be injurious to the animals if ingested. The structure of the indoor housing area
must be kept in good repair and must protect the animals from injury.
Correct the inside enclosure of the indoor housing unit at Doug's Island by 4/26/2020.
Correct the outer enclosures of the remaining housing units by 07/26/2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
