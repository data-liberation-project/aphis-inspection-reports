Facilities, outdoor.
A designated fenced area was recently constructed for the goats. The area does not have a shelter that protects the
animals from inclement weather. Natural or artificial shelter should be provided to animals kept outdoors to afford them
protection and to prevent discomfort. For the health and comfort of the goats, a shelter must be constructed that will
provide them shelter from wind, rain, extreme cold, and snow. Correct by December 6, 2022

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
