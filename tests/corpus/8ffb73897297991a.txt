ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:40am on
03-APR-18.
On April 3rd 2018 at approximately 11:40am I arrived at the facility to perform an inspection. I knocked on the door
repeatedly, called the telephone number provided twice and left one voicemail. I waited for 30 minutes in the
driveway and left the facility.
