2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 p.m. on
02/11/2014.
I knocked on the front door, honked my horn several times and waited in the driveway. I also called the contact
numbers available to me. The licensee answered on her mobile phone and stated that she was away from her
facility and unable to return for several hours.
End of report.
