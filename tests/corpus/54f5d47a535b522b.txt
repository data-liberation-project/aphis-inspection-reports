3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces. Cleaning.
* There were various items inside some of the enclosures that were soiled and had clearly not been sanitized within
the
past two weeks. One was a white and blue rope inside the enclosure housing two lemurs which had turned
completely black and grimy in some areas. Another was a black and white rope inside the enclosure housing one
capuchin which was soiled with a black, grimy substance. The baboon enclosure had a swinging hammock which
was also soiled black around the edges.
* The licensee stated the waste is only being removed from the enclosures every other day. There was clearly more
than one days' worth of food waste and excreta on the floors at the time of inspection in nearly all the enclosures.
* The empty enclosure next to the lemurs is used to care for cats (litter box and feeding). There was a build-up of
waste debris along the edges of that enclosure which were in very close proximity to the lemurs.
** Enrichment items, enclosures, and areas in and around enclosures which are not kept properly cleaned and
sanitized are likely to attract pests and vermin which pose a health risk for the animals.
*** The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces which nonhuman primates come in contact with are spot cleaned
daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.84 (at least once every two weeks). Furthermore, the licensee must ensure
that all other surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices.
3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest Control.* There were numerous cockroaches observed during the inspection throughout most of the facility--both in and
outside of animal enclosures. An excessive amount (too many to count) were observed along the top bar of the
lemur enclosure. The licensee has been using an exterminator service on a monthly basis for over a year in an
attempt to get the pest problem under control. There were numerous dead cockroaches throughout the facility and
the licensee stated they are dying often enough that she has to sweep twice daily. While the pest control program
seems to be eradicating numerous cockroaches, there were still too many live ones in the facility for the program to
be considered effective.
** Cockroaches can easily transmit harmful pathogens and pose a health risk for the animals.
*** The licensee must ensure that an effective pest control program is established and maintained to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. TO BE CORRECTED BY:
15 April 2016
The inspection and an exit interview were conducted by Dr. Amanda Owens (VMO), Mr. Bill Heine (ACI), and the
licensee.
