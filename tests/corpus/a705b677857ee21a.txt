Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A written program of veterinary care with drugs and dosages was documented, but it was not detailed on how and when
to do some of the treatments. Some discrepancies between the treatments provided by the licensee and what was
approved by the veterinarian were identified.
• In Building 1, two rabbits with chronic eye conditions were observed. One tan and white buck rabbit identified as “Hank”
had a severely affected right eye that was swollen and red, oozing yellow and white discharge down the rabbit’s face. The
skin between the eye and the nose was hairless, reddened and inflamed. The rabbit could not keep its right eye fully
open. Another buck rabbit, identified as “Ashton,” was observed to have a small amount of yellow drainage from the left
eye and the skin surrounding the eye was pink and inflamed. They had both received a treatment approved by the
attending veterinarian, but their conditions hadn’t resolved once the regimen was completed. Per the licensee, if the
condition persisted after treatment, the plan was to keep them comfortable and not to treat them. Conversations with the
attending veterinarian revealed that his recommendations to the licensee for persisting eye infections were enucleation of
the affected eye or euthanasia.
• A black rabbit with a white nose in enclosure 300 of Building 1 had two raised, skin-colored, crusty hairless masses on
the left ear. One mass was approximately ½ inch in width and length and the other one was approximately 1 inch wide


and 2 inches long. The licensee explained having treated the ear with a topical salve. The attending veterinarian had not
been contacted about this rabbit and had not approved the use of a salve for this type of condition.
• A black and white doe in Building 1 had been noted by the licensee as being “off feed” and due with kits any day. The
licensee gave an injection of banamine to help with discomfort. When asked, the licensee justified treatment based on the
doe being off feed and uncomfortable. The attending veterinarian stated he did not approve the use of banamine for
rabbits that are pregnant or kindling with the licensee.

Medical care that is not being done exactly per the veterinarian’s instructions can result in inappropriate methods to
diagnose and treat conditions such as those listed above. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian to
obtain a treatment plan for the animals noted above. Moving forward, the licensee must establish a clear method of
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to establish detailed and appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
In building 2, two grey Flemish Giant rabbits that were housed together, were found with a large amount of brown/grey
crusty material inside of the left ear for one and the right ear for the other. For both rabbits, the skin inside the ear, below
the crusty material, was red and inflamed. Areas of dried crusted blood could be seen within the affected area. The
licensee had not identified the conditions affecting these 2 rabbits and therefore had not initiated treatment. Failure to
promptly identify injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and distress in animals with such conditions. A more
rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in order to properly assess their health and well-
being.

Facilities, general.
Upon entering Building 2, a large amount of feces mixed in with food waste was found on the floor below all the rabbits’
wire floor enclosures that was attracting a large number of flies, especially congregating in the sunny areas. The amount
of feces and food waste below the enclosures varied in height but the peak was approximately 6 inches tall. A portion of
the feces was covered with a white fuzzy film that was fungal-like in appearance. Per the licensee, the waste had not
been removed in 2 months. Once a rake was used to push through the waste, insect larvae were seen wriggling in it,
especially in the wet areas. The fecal and food waste accumulation was attracting pests which can become a disease
hazard or area of contamination for the rabbits. Waste accumulation can also lead to odors and disease hazards that can
have adverse effects on the health and well-being of the rabbits. The licensee must have provisions in place for the
removal and disposal of animal and food wastes often enough to minimize pest problems and any potential
contamination, odors, or disease hazards.
