2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult male black and tan Yorkshire terrier named Toby, with microchip number OAO2160359, has a thick,
dark brownish-black build-up of tartar along the gum line, extending halfway down all the top teeth that were visible
during the examination of the dog’s mouth. The inspector was able to examine the front teeth, canines, cheek teeth
and the first molars on both sides. The gums were slightly swollen around the canines and front teeth on both
sides.
***An adult female black Shi Tzu named Magic, with microchip number 105019349, has a buildup of tartar on the
top right side of the check teeth, with the gum line above appearing slightly swollen. The first cheek tooth was loose
when the inspector touched it during the examination.
Dental problems can be painful, make it difficult to eat, can lead to the development of other health problems, and
can affect the well-being of the animal.
The licensee must consult with a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis, and to develop and follow a treatment plan.
The licensee must document the veterinarian's findings, the treatment plan that is followed, and have the records
available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must provide all the animals proper veterinary care at all
times.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted by Lynn Clarke, ACI, with the licensees.
