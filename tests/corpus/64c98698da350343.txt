2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A review of facility records revealed that there is no written program of veterinary care with their current part-time
Attending Veterinarian (AV).
Failure to have formal arrangements with their AV, which include a written program of veterinary care, can have an
adverse impact on animal health due to a lack of regularly scheduled visits from the AV. Correct by implementing a
written program of veterinary care with the AV. Correct by August 12th, 2018.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility's two-and-a-half-year old Russian hamster was observed to have a right eye that was markedly enlarged
and a white, opaque object moving within the eye itself. During inspection and handling, the hamster was observed
to have a normal activity level and appetite but appeared to have a lean body condition and unkempt coat. The
animal also appeared to have impaired vision as it ran into the side of a temporary enclosure and almost off the
edge of a surface. The facility representative stated that the hamster had always had an enlarged eye but could not
state when the white object within the eye was first observed but it had been at least several months. The mammal
log the facility uses to record observations of the animals did not contain any notes regarding the hamster's eye and
the facility representative was unsure if the hamster had ever been evaluated by the Attending Veterinarian (AV).
Medical records reviewed did not reflect any visits to the AV for this hamster. The inspector contacted the AV and
the AV could not recall examining this hamster previously and was therefore unable to make a determination as to
whether or not the animal's condition was being treated appropriately.
Failure to convey problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being to the AV can lead to additional pain and
distress to the animal as well as progression of the medical condition itself. Correct by following your AV's advice
and having the animal examined so that appropriate treatment can be determined. Correct by Monday, July 16th,
2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
