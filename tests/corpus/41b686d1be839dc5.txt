3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
There are several areas of the facility that are in a state of disrepair.
In the fallow deer enclosure, the beams supporting the center of the main barn have large cracks. There are large sheets
of rusted metal attached to the right hand wall which have partially detached from the wall and have sharp edges
projecting into the area animal. There are also several rusted nails and screws projecting into the animal areas on the
interior of the barn. The wire fencing panel that is covering the window in the barn is broken in several areas allowing for
gaps with sharp points.
In the alpaca enclosure, the secondary fence has become detached from the posts in several areas and has become
entangled with overgrown trees and weeds. One area of partial fencing, is pulled away from the post and has created a
gap that is approximately 4 feet tall and tapers to 12 inches wide at the ground.

The areas of structural instability, sharp projecting objects, and detached fencing can cause injury to the animals or result
in entanglement. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. The facility must remove, repair, or replace the above
mentioned items to ensure the safety and well-being of the regulated animals.


3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
There are several areas of the perimeter fence adjacent to the alpaca pen, above the llama and goat pen, and adjacent to
the deer enclosure in which excessive vegetation has grown up, around, and over the perimeter fence. This has resulted
in areas of the perimeter fence sagging or bending under the weight of this growth.

Perimeter fences must be constructed so that they prevent animal escape as well as preventing the entry of other animals
or unauthorized persons. The sagging fence areas impact the integrity of the fence by weakening it and potentially
allowing escape or entry of other animals. Correct by removing the excess vegetation and repairing damaged areas of the
perimeter fence.
2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On December 3, 2020, two sugar gliders escaped from their enclosure when the door was accidentally left open by a
volunteer. The following day, one escaped sugar glider was found unharmed and returned to it's enclosure. The same
day, the other escaped sugar glider was found dead in one of the livestock fields.
As a result of the volunteer leaving the door open, the sugar gliders were able to escape the safety of their enclosure and
roam freely in areas with numerous hazards which lead to the death one of the animals. Handling of all animals shall be
done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Correct by handling animals in a manner that ensures their
health and safety.
Correct by February 4, 2021.
