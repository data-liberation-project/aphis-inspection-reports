Sanitation.
The four enclosures on the right side of building with the perforated rubber flooring have a buildup of smeared excreta
accumulating on the floor surfaces. The cleaning process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this
accumulation. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards and health problems. Primary
enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta. Correct by ensuring that primary
enclosures are kept clean. In addition, enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by October
2, 2021.
