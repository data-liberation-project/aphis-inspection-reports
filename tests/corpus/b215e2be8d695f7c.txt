FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are puddles of standing water and areas of thick mud in the enclosure housing the two Watusi cattle. The
animals have to pass through the standing water and mud to access their feeding station and shelter. The standing
water also creates a suitable breeding environment for mosquitoes and other insect pests. A method of drainage
must be developed to eliminate excess water from the enclosure. Correct by: August 15, 2014.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is an open side gate in the perimeter fence that surrounds the enclosures housing the bears, tigers, and
hyenas. This side of the perimeter fence separates the dangerous animals from the petting zoo area. The open
gate allows pedestrian traffic to flow between the two areas, but is not routinely supervised by zoo personnel and
creates an opening in the the perimeter fence. The open gate does not restrict unauthorized people and unwanted
animals from having access to the animals housed within and cannot function as a secondary containment system
in the event of an animal escape. The open gate must be closed or corrected in some manner to eliminate an open
area in the perimeter fence. Correct by: July 18, 2014.
