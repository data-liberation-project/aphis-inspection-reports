2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
For the past two semi-annual evaluations (conducted November 2019 and May 2020) an Institutional Official (IO) report
has not been generated. Organizing the semi-annual evaluation findings into the IO report provides a means of
accountability for correcting identified deficiencies, and therefore helps assure optimal animal welfare. The Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) shall prepare reports of its evaluations and submit the reports to the IO. The
reports must contain all of the required information.
