SANITATION.
The (cid:28)foxtail(cid:29) grasses have not been cut around the back area of the lion enclosures (behind and outside of the
primary enclosures and the exercise area) this season. The area is about 10-15 feet wide and 100-150 feet + long.
The foxtails (about 12-18 inches high) are drying and if the seeds get into the pens, the seeds could penetrate the
skin, nose, ears, eyes or other body parts. Also, the tall grass makes it hard to monitor rodent, other pest activity,
and creates a fire hazard for the animals.
For the health and well-being of the animals, the facility should create a system to routinely monitor and correct
these types of hazards in a timely manner.
