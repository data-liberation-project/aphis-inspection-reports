3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The current program of veterinary care does not include a sampling program with a schedule approved by the attending
veterinarian for fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworms. Lack of a sampling program makes it difficult to
determine the effectiveness of the treatment plan for parasites. A sampling and treatment program with a schedule
approved by the attending veterinarian must be established to help prevent and maintain an effective parasite program.

This is a 1st re-license inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or within 60 days of today or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next re-license inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
