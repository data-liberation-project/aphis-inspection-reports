RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The inventory for the animals was inaccurate. The pigs and goats were not updated and there wasn't a record of the
rabbits on hand. Exhibitors are to make, keep and maintain records of the animals on hand that were acquired, or
disposed of. The records should also be updated when offspring are born. Complete and accurate records must be
kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of
animals. Correct by June 17, 2017.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the rabbit's run, that contained 18 rabbits, there was a chicken wire mesh embedded in the concrete that was not
flush with the wall. The wire was coming away from the wall exposing it's pointy ends. The rabbit's enclosure should
not have injurious materials and should be safely constructed for the animals that it contains. Correct by May 31,

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the large pasture, containing the sheep, a cow and a donkey, there were areas of the primary fencing that the
ends were unraveling. The unraveled ends were pointy and could potentially injure the animals. There were other
areas where broken wires were missing and the animals could get their heads stuck and possibly injured. All of the
enclosures should be constructed to prevent injury of the animals including the materials used for the fencing and
keeping it in good repair.
