INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On 11 January 2018, 15 rabbits had blood collected from them on study # 17C356Q4R2G132. In reviewing the
protocol, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol did not approve blood collection in this
study, and there are no IACUC approved amendments to allow blood collection. The proposed amendment to the
study protocol increased the invasiveness of the study, but the amendment was not approved by the IACUC. The
IACUC SOP for amendments considers a significant change to be an increase in the invasiveness of the study, and
therefore the IACUC should have approved the amendment before blood was collected from the animals.
Any significant changes to a protocol, such as blood collection, must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior
to conducting any activity associated with the change. An IACUC review of protocol changes is to ensure that
animals do not experience unnecessary pain and distress and to verify that personnel are adequately trained to
conduct the new procedures.
Correct from this day forward.
2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In several animal rooms, uncovered syringes with gavage tips were present and could become contaminated before
being used on animals. In several wash rooms, the hose sprayer was not properly labeled as to the chemical
contents, and a pump sprayer was also not properly labeled. In the wash room, the unlabeled containers could
result in disease transmission because the enclosures are hand washed and may not be appropriately sanitized.
Exposed syringes or unlabeled sprayers are not consistent with appropriate methods to prevent diseases and
injuries in animals.
Correct from this day forward.
3.14(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.Several transport kennels in the wash room in building D had fine wire mesh attached to the front door. The edges
of the wire mesh was frayed, creating sharp points protruding into the enclosure that could injure the dogs. These
transport enclosures are used to move dogs between facility locations and in commerce, therefore must meet the
requirements for transporting covered species, which include no sharp points or edges that could injure the animals
contained in it.
Correct from this day forward.
3.51(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In several rabbit rooms, the interior surfaces were no longer substantially impervious to moisture to facilitate
sanitizing. In room C13 an empty junction box created an opening in the wall. In another rabbit room, the wall had
been patched with plaster, but not painted, so it was no longer impervious to moisture. Interior building surfaces of
indoor housing facilities shall be substantially impervious to moisture and maintained so they may be readily
sanitized. In this facility, the animal rooms are not dedicated to a single species, so the ability to sanitize the room
between species is crucial for the health and well being of the covered animals.
Correction date: 15 March 2018
3.53(a)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In rooms C12 and C16, eight rabbit enclosures had cracks or holes in the floor of the enclosure. Approximately half
of the damaged enclosures currently had rabbits in them. As soon as the damage was identified, rabbits were
moved to clean enclosures without cracks or holes. The enclosures with holes in the floor could trap the foot of a
rabbit and has the potential to result in serious injury and suffering.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained in a manner that protects the feet and legs of rabbits from
injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosures must be checked to ensure that there are no cracks or holes in the plastic
floor that could trap feet of the rabbits and cause injury.
Correct from this day forward.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In several pig enclosures in building B, the epoxy floor was no longer sealed, and the floor was peeling in several
places.The facility is currently in the process of replacing the floors in the building, but has not yet repaired these animal
facilities.
A system of maintenance should be in place to ensure that animal enclosures are regularly repaired to maintain
their structural integrity, prevent escape or injury and facilitate cleaning.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
