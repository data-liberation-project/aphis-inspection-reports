SANITATION.
Animal transport trailer- The metal dividing panels in stalls used to contain the camels and zebras during transport
have a moderate buildup of rust in several areas on these panels. Also, two panels are missing screws along the
lower portion causing the corners of these panels to loosen and protrude outward. Animal facilities must be kept
clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. A
system of timely identification, repair or replacement, and maintenance of facility issues must be in place.
