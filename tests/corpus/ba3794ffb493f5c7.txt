ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee was unable to provide the written program of veterinary care at the time of the inspection. The written
program of veterinary care conveys the attending veterinarian's expectations for routine preventative medical care,
emergency veterinary care, and euthanasia for regulated species housed at the facility. The facility should ensure
that said written program of veterinary care is available for review during APHIS Animal Care inspections.
