3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In an elevated pen inside the whelping room, there was an accumulation of old feces with an adult female Old English
Sheepdog named Macy and her 1 week old puppy. Some of the fecal material was covered with mold. The licensee
admitted that she had not been cleaning the pen because the dog was a very nervous mom so she did not want to disturb
her until the puppy was a week old. The feces are a source of contamination to the enclosed animals. Excreta and food
waste must be removed daily from all primary enclosures.
Corrected at the time of inspection

- In the two elevated outdoor enclosures (North and South Pen #6), containing 26 dogs total, the catch pans are draining
directly on to the ground. Prior to the inspection, the licensee had made an effort to remove the waste buildup and treat
the ground with a pesticide to kill maggots. Dead maggots were seen at one drain exit, however, maggots were still alive
at a second drain exit. The accumulation of waste exposes the dogs to potential disease and pest hazards. The facility
must continue to address the drainage in an appropriate manner to reduce these hazards.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
