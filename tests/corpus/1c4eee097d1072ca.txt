ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male donkey “Papa” has a large area of hair loss across the top of the hindquarters. Areas of thinning hair are
located along the backside of both the upper left hind quarter and the upper right hindquarter. Areas of thinning hair
are also located on both sides of the base of the tail and a small area of hair loss is located on the left side of the
base of the tail. The keeper present at the time of the inspection stated that the donkey has been scratching his
hindquarters frequently and thought that another keeper may have made notes on the donkey’s condition. No
keeper notes concerning the donkey’s hair loss and excessive scratching behavior could be found and the attending
veterinarian was not aware of the donkey’s condition. Excessive scratching, thinning hair coat, and hair loss could
indicate an underlying health issue.

This donkey must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector
upon request.
Correction date: The attending veterinarian evaluated the donkey at the time of the inspection.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A large enclosure is located in front of the wallaby barn and there is a walking path for the public that runs through
this enclosure. At least five wallabies have access to this enclosure at the time of the inspection and the animals
hopped freely across the walking path and near the people.
A group of three young children came within approximately 2-3 feet of a female wallaby with a joey in her pouch.
The children crouched down and reached for the animal and also tried to offer the wallaby grass to attempt to bring
the animal closer. The female wallaby hopped away from the children and across the walking path to another area
of the enclosure near a woman with a stroller. There are no employees present to supervise the potential public
contact with the animals and there are also no public barriers to keep the wallabies and people away from eachother. Unsupervised contact between people and wallabies could result in a dangerous situation.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public. The facility must either establish acceptable barriers to keep the free-ranging
wallabies at a sufficient distance from the public or a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee
or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. The facility must ensure that all required
measures are taken to eliminate any potentially dangerous situations between animals and the public.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representatives.
