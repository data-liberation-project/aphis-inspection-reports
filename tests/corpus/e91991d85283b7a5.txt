3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On Sunday, May 28, 2017, a six year old male giraffe named Ernie, was discovered by zoo staff to have his head
and neck entrapped. The giraffe’s head and neck were stuck under a lower horizontal bar on the catwalk railing,
around a wall, and caught above a horizontal bar on the catwalk railing on the other side of the wall. The giraffe was
sedated by the zoo veterinarian to free the animal from the railing. The giraffe died shortly after he was freed.
Plywood has since been installed along the catwalk railing to prevent another giraffe from putting his head and neck
through the railing. Three hay racks were also removed from the giraffe barn during this inspection since the racks
had large gaps on the sides between the enclosure wall and the vertical metal bars.
All primary animal enclosures must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and constructed in a manner to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection was conducted with the Vice President, Chief Veterinarian, and Lead/ Keeper/Registrar and exit
interview was conducted with the President & CEO and the General Curator.
