FACILITIES, INDOOR.
( c ) Lighting.
***** At time of inspection the indoor lock down area for the bears had insufficent lighting to provide for the needs of
the bear which has no access to the outdoors. Additional lighting such as the type that provides full spectrum
lighting should be of consideration to those animals that would benefit from natural sunlight and do not have access.
Lighting must provide sufficient intensity to allow for inspections of the area and for the husbandry practices
required to maintain the area. Lighting which will provide for all of these requirements needs to be added in the lock
downs for the bears.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
***** At time of inspection the male bear which is housed in the enclosure indoors closest to the human entry door
was confined to an area with no access to the outdoors and had been being maintained this way for a prolonged
period of time.
This area combined with a like size indoor lock down area used for lock down of another bear at this facility which
has access to the outdoor exhibit area is the only additional space the one bear has access to during those periods
when the one bear is on exhibit.
This housing practice fails to provide the bear with access to the outdoors, full access to the benefits of sunshine
and of fresh air and the value that both of these provide to help insure good health. This housing situation also is a
stress factor to this bear as it has to routinely watch as the other bear is outdoors which is possible by the one
opening in the wall of each lockdown looking onto the exhibit which is covered with a steel woven wire covering. This bear needs to be provided with space and access to the outdoors which will aid in reducing the current stress
being experienced and to prevent long term lack of exposure to the outdoor elements of sunshine and fresh air
which aids in good health.
