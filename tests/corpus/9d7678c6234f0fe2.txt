RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records reviewed did not include the required disposition information (name and address of the persons to whom
animals were given/sold) for the rabbits and chinchillas that left the facility in December 2019. Accurate records are
required to identify legal ownership and to allow for tracing of animals. The facility shall make, keep and maintain
records which fully and correctly disclose all required information for animals disposed of by the facility to include
the name and address of the person to whom an animal was sold or given, the date of sale/disposal, the species
and the number of animals. Correct by 4/1/2020.

WATERING.
The water trough receptacles for the goats are in need of cleaning. All three have many leaves in the water in the
troughs. There is visible green algae like growth on the bottom surfaces of the troughs. Clean potable water is
necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. All water troughs/receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

SANITATION.
The enclosures housing the cavy and the prairie dogs are in need of cleaning. Fecal pellets are scattered
throughout the entire enclosures. Lack of clean areas means the animals can't move about the enclosures and can't
access their food and water without coming in contact with the fecal material. The facility representative stated that
today is the day for weekly cleaning. Based on the amount of fecal material present, cleaning more than once
weekly appears to be indicated. Adequate and frequent cleaning is necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals and to minimize disease hazards. Excreta shall be removed from the primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein. Correct by 3/11/2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
