FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wooden stall doors in three interior zebra holding enclosures have areas of peeling paint from approximately
12" to 18" above the floor along the entire width of the doors. The concrete block walls of these three interior zebra
holding enclosures have areas of peeling paint and unsealed concrete block approximately 12" to 18" above the
floor around the perimeter of each enclosure. The peeling paint could potentially be ingested by the six zebra
housed in these three stalls. Interior housing facilities must be structurally sound and be maintained in good repair
to protect the health and well-being of the animals housed within them. To be corrected by: 10/17/14.
