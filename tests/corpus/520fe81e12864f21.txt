CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Two rabbits are being housed together with a Toucan in the indoor primary enclosure. Rabbits are a prey species
and can become easily stressed when housed with other animals. Rabbits housed with other species may have a
negative impact on the health of either animal due to potential spread of disease and contamination. Rabbits must
not be housed in the same primary enclosure with another species unless required for scientific reasons.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The back wall of the indoor enclosure housing the two wallabies has two holes. The drywall is exposed in both the
holes and white chalk is flaking off onto the ledge. These areas are not in good repair and the exposed drywall
could be a health hazard to the animals if ingested. Construct and maintain the indoor facilities so that they are
structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals.
