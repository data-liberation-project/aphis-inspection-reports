INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Following an invasive surgical teaching laboratory, five out of six cows developed post-operative peritonitis; four
were euthanized and one died. The following issues were noted:
- This was a major surgical procedure conducted in a prep area not a surgical suite.
- Post-operative care was inadequate.
The protocol allows the cows to be returned to the farm the day after surgery, or the following day. While these
cows stayed at the VM hospital for 3 days post-surgery, it is unclear how closely they were observed once they
were returned to the farm. At the farm, the Animal Caretakers are the people performing the daily observation.
There are only 2 caretakers at the farm, and they are responsible for feeding, cleaning, observing all animals at the
farm (horses, cows, sheep), maintenance of the buildings/fences, and all pasture maintenance. Their time for
observation is limited and not adequate for animals recovering from a major surgery.
Performing a major surgical procedure in a prep area (not a dedicated surgical suite) and the lack of adequate daily
monitoring and observation when the cows returned to the farm may have contributed to the post-operative
complications and death of the animals.
Major operative procedures must be conducted in facilities intended for that purpose and those facilities must be
operated and maintained under aseptic conditions. Animals post-surgery must be properly monitored and observed
to detect and treat or prevent any complications.
To be corrected from this day forward.

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
At some point in a major surgical procedure, five out of six student groups breached aseptic techniques. This was
demonstrated by the fact that five of the cows developed post-operative peritonitis; 4 cows had to be euthanized
and one died. The students must be carefully trained in aseptic surgical methods and procedures. At thisprocedure, there were 5 instructors; 3 veterinarians, with one not scrubbing in but coming through and observing the
student group actions, and 2 technicians, for 6 student groups. There must be enough qualified personnel to
adequately monitor the students and to ensure that the students are using aseptic techniques.
To be corrected from this day forward.
The institution recognized that there were errors in surgical technique and post-operative monitoring. The IACUC
has thoroughly reviewed the incident and suspended the protocol pending protocol changes.
Exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
