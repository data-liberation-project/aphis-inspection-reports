2.50(c)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee states that she uses microchip as the form of official USDA identification but does not have a
microchip reader available for use. She also stated that she has not received approval to use microchip as her
official USDA identification. Failure to have a microchip reader available and approval to use microchip as the
official USDA identification does not allow the inspector to verify that the dogs are properly identified and does not
ensure for the proper tracking of the animals. The licensee must obtain approval to use microchip as her official
form of identification and have a microchip reader readily available at all times.
