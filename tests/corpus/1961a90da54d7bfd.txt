Facilities, indoor.
Interior Surfaces: The rabbit primary enclosures are equipped with an enrichment device that is attached to the inside of
the enclosure door with a small link chain. Approximately 20 enclosures were noted to have an enrichment device
attached to the door with a rusted chain. Per this Section, the surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be maintained so
that they may be readily sanitized. Rusted surfaces cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized. This item needs to be
addressed for the health of the rabbits.

This is a 1st Relicense Inspection for a Class “B” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
Applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by 11/12/22 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection. Regulated
activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
