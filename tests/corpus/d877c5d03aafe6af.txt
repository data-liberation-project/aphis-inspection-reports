Facilities, general.
The enclosure for the bobcat contains a water feature. The electrical cords leading to the pumps for the water feature
extend across approximately 4-6 ft of the enclosure floor and are accessible to the bobcat. The exposed cords may lead
to injury or shock if the bobcat were to play with the cords.
The facility for the bobcat including the items inside the enclosure should be constructed and maintained such that they
protect the animal from injury. Correct by 8/19/21.
