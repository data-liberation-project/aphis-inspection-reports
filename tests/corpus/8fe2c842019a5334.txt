FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chain link was pulled away from the bottom of the cavy gate. This has created a hole large enough for an
animal to become entrapped or escaped.
There is an area at the north west corner of the bison shelter where the sheet metal is torn. A sharp edge is
protruding from the side and is a potential area for animal injury. These areas must be repaired to protect the
animals from injury and contain them.
Corrected during inspection.
Inspection and exit briefing was conducted with owner and mammal caretaker.
