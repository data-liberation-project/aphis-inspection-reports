During inspection, records indicated that on February 14th, 2021, the sugar glider cage was left open overnight and
discovered in the morning. One sugar glider was recaptured, but the other sugar glider was found dead in the ferret cage.
The facility identified that a part time employee did not follow their training in acceptable husbandry practices by failing to
secure and check the cage door. The identified part time employee was immediately removed from the schedule and
hours were cut to zero as a result of this incident.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Curator and manager.
