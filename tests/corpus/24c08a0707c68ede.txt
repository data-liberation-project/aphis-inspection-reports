veterinarian and recommendations documented for treatment of the animals. Treatment that was recommended by
the veterinarian that has not been implemented or followed has affected the following animals:
Shula, female Bengal tiger - was prescribed metacam on 8/22/16 but had not been getting the medication as
prescribed.
Turbo, a mountain lion - was recommended for euthanasia on two different occasions (12/15/15 and 8/22/16) due to
mobility concerns.
Marshmellow, a male sheep was reccomended to be dewormed and provided a different diet.
- In addition, a feeding protocol for animals present at the sanctuary was updated in January 2013. Observation of
the animals at the facility, review of the available feeding records, availability of food at the facility and discussion
with volunteers indicates that the feeding protocol is not being followed.
Exhibitors shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
The sanctuary has not given the appropriate authority to the veterinarian to provide medical care and treatment to
the animals present. Nor has the facility communicated with the veterinarian about appropriate diets for the animals
that have been observed to have lost weight.
The facility must provide the appropriate authority to the attending veterinarian for the veterinary care of the animals
starting immediately.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing 2 cats and the enclosure housing an additional 6 cats with the birds had laminate flooring.
The laminate flooring where the two cats are has been pecked on by the birds, according the the facility
representative, in the corners and is not being kept in good repair. In addition the laminate flooring is no longer
sticking to the wall and floors making it such that it can not be properly cleaned and sanitized as required.
The housing facilities for these animals need to be kept in good repair to allow for proper cleaning and sanitizing, to
prevent pest infestation, and to promote the health and well-being of the animals.
To be corrected by October 24, 2016.
3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The housing facility area down by the cabin where there are 5 dogs housed has plywood, trash, and other
discarded material within and around the enclosures.
- The housing facility for the 5 cats in the feed room in the barn has an accumulation of items to include trash, junk
and other items used for the barn animals. The enclosure and the area around the enclosure are covered in a layer
of dust and are not being kept neat and free of clutter.
- The housing facility for the 8 cats that are housed in the two rooms with all of the birds has an accumulation of
items to include trash, items used for birds, a dirty fish tank, items stored for other reasons and other discarded
material. The floor has areas where birds defecate that the cats could walk through.

3.7(d)
COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
There are 8 cats that are intermingled in two areas that together have fifty plus birds of varying kinds. At least two of
the birds were observed to have feathers missing. Cats are predators to birds which could be contributing to the
feather loss.
These cats should not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals unless they are
compatible.
To be corrected by October 10, 2016.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
There was food for the 6 wolf hybrids "up top" on the ground. There were four buckets connected to the fencing
that were supposed to be used for feeding the animals but they had water in them and were not being used as food
receptacles as intended.
Food receptacles must be used for the wolf hybrids to minimize contamination by excreta and pests.
To be corrected by October 3, 2016.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The enclosure housing 2 cats and a wide array of birds had newspapers on the floor with piles of bird feces. In
addition, there was bird feed and other debris throughout the enclosure.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent soiling of the animals and to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
This enclosure needs to be properly cleaned to promote the health and well-being of the animals within by October10, 2016.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is a sheltered area provided for the 4 dogs over by the bears. The area where the dog food and other items
are stored was observed to be in disarray with an accumulation of trash, a white tarp and other debris. The items
were covered with a thick layer of dirt. The facility representative stated that they have had problems with mice in
the area.
These premises and all other premises on the property need to be kept clean and in good repair to protect the
animals from injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices required in this subpart, and to reduce or eliminate
breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin. The premises need to be kept free of
accumulation of trash, junk, waste products and discarded matter.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The enclosure housing "Stinky," the African Lion has a section of chain link fence approximately 2-4 feet from the
primary enclosure fencing that was loose, bent over, and not serving as containment. The volunteer stated that it
was a section of old fencing that had never been removed.
- The greenhouse down by the cabin housing 2 pigs had a file cabinet, dirty blankets, a dirty crate and various other
items in with the animals. One of the pigs was observed crawling over the board that was supposed to contain them
in the front half of the enclosure.
- There were pieces of green chain link fencing, meant to prevent the animals from digging, protruding from the
ground exposing the animals to risk for injury in the enclosure that was housing 2 Syrian brown bears.
- The catch up pen provided for the 2 younger Syrian brown bears had wires protruding into the pen exposing sharp
points to the bears. In the same enclosure, there were two trees that had tin around the trunks to prevent the
animals from climbing. The tin had been bent outward by the bears exposing sharp edges and points to the animals.
These sharp points have the potential to injure the animals.
These housing facilities need to be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals
involved. They also need to be maintained in good repair, to include all sharp points and edges being repaired or
replaced, to protect the animals from injury.

area. In addition, the chicken that was out to thaw inside the cooler is set up such that the juices drain from the
container the chicken is in down the end of the cooler and out on to the ground. The ground where the juices
dripped was covered in a green slimy material with flies swarming around. The inside of the cooler had a pile of
wood, trash, and other debris sitting next to the freezer causing the potential for vermin infestation.
- The food storage area in the barn was covered with a thick layer of dust, There was trash and other debris
throughout the room. There was a bag of feed and a barrel of alfalfa pellets that were open with flies throughout the
area.
