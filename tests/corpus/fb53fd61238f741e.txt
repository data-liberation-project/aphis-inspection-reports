ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:33pm on
27-FEB-19.
The gate was padlocked so I was unable to ring the doorbell. I attempted to call but was unable to leave a message
as the voicemail was full. I texted that I was there but did not receive a text in return. I honked the horn several
times but got no response.
