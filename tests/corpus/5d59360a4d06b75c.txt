FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee has constructed new shelters in the goat & sheep pens. These two shelters are slightly elevated off
the ground leaving a small gap between the ground and the shelter. This space, however, is sufficient to possibly
allow a newborn or small animal to get under it and get out of the enclosure, or get entrapped within that space.
This space shall be corrected to prevent any size animal from possibly inuring itself or getting out of their enclosure.
