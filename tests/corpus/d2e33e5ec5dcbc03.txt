ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The oldest zebra on the property, a male named Zillion, has overgrown hooves. The right front hoof is long and
sloping slightly upward. One brown and white female goat has slightly overgrown claws on her right front and rear
feet. The outer claws are long and starting to curl inward. Overgrown hooves can result in foot damage and
lameness. These animals need to have their feet trimmed to prevent potential problems. To be corrected by
5-23-15.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two male baboons are housed in a chain link outdoor enclosure with an attached sheltered enclosure. They have
destroyed a plank perch in the enclosure leaving 5 loose boards (possibly with nails) on the ground. A small metal
chain which held a round toy swing from the chain link ceiling is hanging loosely from the toy posing a potential
hanging hazard. All structures within non-human primate housing must be designed and constructed so that they
are structurally sound and kept in good repair to prevent potential injury of the animals. These broken structures
need to be repaired or replaced. To be corrected by 5-1-15.
Licensee was not present as both units are in travel status.
