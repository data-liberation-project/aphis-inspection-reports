2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection the licensee was unable to locate the program of veterinary care. The written program was
previously inspected by APHIS officials and evidence that the veterinarian has recently provided care for the
animals was produced by the licensee. Maintaining a written program of veterinary care ensures that the licensee is
able to follow the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions on providing adequate care for the animals. A written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer or exhibitor must be maintained by the
licensee and made available for APHIS officials during inspections.
Correct by contacting the attending veterinarian and implementing the written program of veterinary care by close of
business on 1/18/2016.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee and Veterinary Medical Officer, Michael
Neafsey.
