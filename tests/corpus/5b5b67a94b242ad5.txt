REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This was a search inspection.
Facility owner's wife was present during this search inspection. Owner's wife stated that they currently have about
15-20 dogs. Owner(cid:25)s wife stated that she was unsure how her husband sold their puppies. However; sales records
confirm that they sold puppies to a pet store on 1/08/14. Regulations regarding licensing requirements were
explained in detail. When greater than 4 breeding females are maintained, the wholesale sale of puppies without a
license is a violation of Section 2.1 of the Animal Welfare Act. Any person operating or intending to operate as a
dealer (who is not otherwise exempted from the licensing requirements) must have a valid license. The owner shall
file a completed application form with the AC Regional Director if he would like to conduct any further regulated
activity.
An application packet was provided to the owner's Wife.
