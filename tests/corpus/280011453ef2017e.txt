FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In at least 4 enclosures the metal frames are rusted through resulting in holes 2-3 inches in diameter with jagged
edges. These rusted surfaces may also be affecting the structural strength of these frames. Surfaces with
excessive rust and jagged edges may cause injury to the animals. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular
basis to prevent excessive rust from developing. Correct by 14 October 2015.
