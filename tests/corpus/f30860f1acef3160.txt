Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. There were 2 guinea pigs with masses under the chin. A
brown and black adult guinea pig in Pen 31 and a gray adult guinea pig in Pen 25 both had firm movable masses
approximately 1 inch in size under the chin. The animals were in good body condition and did not appear lethargic. The
licensee had not observed the health conditions in the guinea pigs, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and was
not administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and provided
treatment options.
Swellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of the
animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment
for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional animals if the
condition is contagious.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or communicate with the attending
veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
2.75(b)(1)



Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The last inventory of the number of animals on file was documented in June. There was no current inventory of the
number of guinea pigs including adults, weanlings, and newborns.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Primary enclosures.
There were 2 self-feeders observed with broken areas in the lip of the trough resulting in a sharp surface that would likely
come in contact with the guinea pigs as they approached the trough to feed. The broken feeders were in Pen 43
containing 19 guinea pigs and Pen 10 containing 18 guinea pigs.
Sharp surfaces in guinea pig enclosures may result in injury to the animals.
Primary enclosures including accessories in the enclosure must be maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs
from injury.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
