FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several of the tiger's resting wooden platforms and/or the tops of the wooden shelters are excessively
chewed/clawed and sharp splintered wood exists. The shelters and platforms must be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals. The areas of concern need to be addressed so that they are smooth and not likely to cause
any injury.
