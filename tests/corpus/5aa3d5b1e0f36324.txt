ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1730 on
16-Nov-16. I went to the licensee's house. The licensee was not home. His mother-in-law was home, but she was
unable to answer the questions I had. I informed her I would send an Attempted Inspection report and that I would
be back sometime in the next couple of months.
End of report.
