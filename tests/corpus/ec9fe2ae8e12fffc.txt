3.56(a)(1)

Sanitation.
1. Excessive feces are present inside of three rabbit enclosures and in the trough below one rabbit enclosure. All the
rabbit enclosures containing excessive feces are in the larger rabbit housing structure. One black and white rabbit (left
row), one tan rabbit (right row), and one grey rabbit (right row) have excessive feces in the corners of their enclosures.
One black and grey rabbit had excessive feces in the trough below its enclosure. Feces can produce odors and attract
insects. Thoroughly clean and sanitize the affected enclosures and repeat often enough to prevent build up.

2. Excessive rabbit fur is present on the netting directly above the rabbit enclosures. The affected enclosures are in the
right row, located in the larger rabbit housing structure. The netting is present above the rabbit enclosures to prevent
chickens from gaining access to this area. Additionally, excessive rodent feces were observed on the insulation foam
board located directly above the rabbit enclosures in the same row. Rodent feces are a potential disease hazard. Clean
this area and repeat often enough to prevent build up.

3.56(d)

Sanitation.

Excessive rodent feces were observed on the insulation board, located on top of the rabbit enclosures. The feces were
observed in the right aisle of the larger rabbit housing structure. The licensee has pest control provisions in place, but it
does not appear these provisions are effectively controlling the rodent population in this area. Rodents can carry and
spread diseases. Maintain an effective program for the control of rodents.
