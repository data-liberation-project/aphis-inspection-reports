FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In speaking to the owner, and reviewing a video that was submitted to the Eastern Regional Office, it is apparent,
that on occasion, a staff member / employee will need to feed the Syrian and Black bears. At this time the bear
enclosures do not have "lockouts" and the staff member has to go into the pen to feed them. To ensure that the
animals are properly contained at the time of entry and exit of the staff member / employee, a system will need to be
in place to ensure that the bears can not escape.
In speaking with the owner, an extension will be added to the Syrian bear enclosure this winter and a "lockout " will
be added. He has also agreed to add a "lockout" to the Black bear enclosure.
