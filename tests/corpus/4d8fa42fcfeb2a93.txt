Pest Control (For Guinea Pigs)
A wild mouse seen by the hedgehogs also has access to the guinea pigs in Building 1. No pest control program for
wild rodents is in place. Wild rodents such as mice can bring sicknesses in that can make the guinea pigs sick. To
protect the health of the animals, ensure that wild rodents cannot get into the building and that a safe and effective
pest control program is in place.

WATERING.
The water bottles for the hedgehogs had a film of dark material built up on the inside. This dark material is a sign
that the bottles have not been cleaned recently and could cause the hedgehogs to get sick. To protect the health of
the animals, the water bottles must be kept clean and sanitary.

SANITATION.
Two of the hedgehog enclosures had an excessive amount of wet soiled material by the water bottles. Wet soiled
material can make animals sick and does not provide for their comfort. Ensure that the hedgehog enclosures are
cleaned often enough to prevent a buildup of wet soiled material.

Pest Control (For Hedgehogs)
The licensee and I saw a live mouse behind one of the hedgehog enclosures during inspection. No current pest
control for rodents is in place inside the building. Wild rodents could bring sicknesses inside the building that can
make the hedgehogs sick. To protect the health of the animals, the facility must ensure rodents do not gain access
to the building and that an effective and safe pest control program is in place at all times.
