HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During this inspection no employees were wearing any type of identification to make them readily identifiable as
employees. The auction charges admission to the auction grounds. Members of the public were observed petting
the animals and entering enclosures by the inspector without any readily identifiable employee or attendant present
within visual range. On Friday two women with a small child were noted entering multiple enclosures in the arena
area including one with animals with horns. Also on Friday, the inspector noted a women in the warm room who had
received a scratch that drew blood by a cat she and her husband were interacting with. On Saturday, two boys were
seen climbing into an enclosure housing a kangaroo with one of the boys hugging the kangaroo. Many of the
animals housed at the auction may be potentially dangerous to people having contact with them. A responsible,
knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public
contact.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The weather during the auction included rain Thursday Nov. 7. The weather was dry but cold on Friday Nov. 8
(highs in the low 40s) and dry on Saturday Nov. 9.
*The outdoor enclosures/pens in the back behind the covered barn stalls/pens are completely open to the elements
with no sides or overhead protection from inclement weather. The animals outside including the water buffalo, cattle
and bison had no protection or shelter to allow them to remain dry. On Friday the dirt flooring in their enclosures
was wet sloppy mud with large areas of standing water in a few of the stalls. The animals' haircoats became wet.
The mud in the enclosures was over ankle deep for many of the animals. The animals' feet made sucking sounds
when lifted by the animals to move about. In some of the pens the animals did not have any dry ground to move to
to get out of the mud/standing water. By Saturday the standing water had cleared but the thick ankle deep mud
remained. Several of the animals had mud covered haircoats from lying down in the mud overnight.
*Several enclosures/stalls in the covered barn area have one side open to the elements. The one enlosure closest
to the auction ring housed several zebu. The rain water had entered this enclosure and the ground turned into thick
mud. There was little to no dry ground for the animals to access. The lower half of the zebus' legs were covered in
wet mud. When the zebu were standing in the muddy areas, the mud came up over their hooves and their hooveswere not visible.
*Excessively muddy/wet ground in the enclosures may lead to slipping of the animals, hoof problems and injury. In
addition, the inability to seek shelter from the inclement weather may lead to distress to the animals. Live animals
shall be provided protection to allow them to remain dry during inclement weather.

WATERING.
The hoofstock/large animals housed in the barn and outside stalls did not have access to potable water at all times
and water was not provided on Friday or Saturday as noted by the inspector. Several enclosures, including some
enclosures for nilgai and bison, did not even have water receptacles in their enclosures. Most of the enclosures had
empty water receptacles that the appeared empty and dry on the inside and muddy on the outside due to being
kicked around in the enclosure by the animals. This included an enclosure housing three white bison one of which
was seen to be a nursing calf. One horse owner took his horse out of its enclosure and walked it over to a bucket
with some water he had procured. The horse drank for the next five minutes.
Potable water is necessary to prevent dehydration. If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it
must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals based on the animals age,
species, condition, size and type. Correct by next auction.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
During this auction the inspector noted several transport enclosures housing animals that did not contain any litter
or suitable absorbant material to absorb and cover excreta. A coatimundi (one) enclosure and a cavy enclosure
(two) had solid bottoms with no absorbent material. Excreta and food waste was noted on the solid floor of both.
The animals had stepped in the waste material and had it on their haircoat of their feet. An African Crested
porcupine was housed in an enclosure with completely wet shavings. It's feet were wet. All three enclosures were in
the same condition on Saturday. The enclosures had not been cleaned and no absorbent material had been added.
Lack of absorbent material/litter to cover excreta and wastes can cause skin/coat contamination, distress, and
increased risk of disease. Animals must be provided clean litter of a suitable absorbent material that can absorb
and cover excreta.
3.139(a)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
During the inspector's time at the auction on Friday and Saturday, none of the animals in the warm room or outside
locked small exotic animal areas were offered water. If the water receptacle was noted empty and dry on Friday
morning, it was still empty and dry on Saturday. This included multiple species including cavy, arctic foxes, ferrets,African crested porcupines, hedgehogs, guinea pigs and sugar gliders. Access to potable water is necessary to
prevent dehydration. Operators of auction sales shall provide potable water to all live animals at least every 12
hours. Correct by next auction.
This inspection was conducted on Nov. 8 and Nov. 9. The exit interview was conducted with undersigned facility
representative on Nov. 12.
