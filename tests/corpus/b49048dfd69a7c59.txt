HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is an inadequate barrier between the two leopards and the two tigers and the general public and/or
unauthorized personnel. There is a stairwell in the lobby of the theater, near the box office, that leads downstairs to
the animal housing area. There was not a lock on either door of the stairwell; therefore, anyone could walk down
the stairs and have access to the animals. The theater is located in a building that also has other businesses such
as a coffee shop and a gift shop. The tables and seating for the coffee shop patrons are located in the box office
area near the stairwell. Inadequate barriers can compromise the safety of the animals and/or the public. The
licensee must ensure that all areas of access to the animals are secured at all times.
THE FACILITY REPRESENTATIVES WERE INSTRUCTED TO SECURE THE STAIRWELL BY THE END OF THE
DAY. THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A LOCK INSTALLED ON THE DOOR TODAY.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An adult white tiger named Precious was exhibiting signs of anxiety. She was continuously panting and would
frequently snarl, flatten her ears, and growl at observers. Once she charged at the window while observers were
looking in. Her body seemed tense and she layed in a sternal position throughout the inspection. A few days
earlier, Precious was moved to this exhibit next to the box office in the theater lobby which resulted in four changes
for her: 1) she was living in a strange environment, 2) she was living alone without any other animals within sight for
the first time in her life, 3) she was on public display for longer periods of time than she was used to, and 4) she was
being exposed to a large number of strangers. Changes in an animal's routine and habitat can cause stress which
can affect the animal's health and psychological well-being. The licensee must ensure that Precious is exhibited
only for periods of time and under conditions that are consistent with her good health and well-being.

FACILITIES, INDOOR. The two tigers and the two leopards in the downstairs housing area have insufficient lighting. The lighting, which is
provided by a few light bulbs on the walls behind the enclosures, is not uniformly distributed and is too dim.
Adequate lighting is necessary for proper visualization of the animals and for cleaning purposes. The licensee shall
provide good quality and ample lighting appropriate for these species of animals.

and their new housing facilities.
