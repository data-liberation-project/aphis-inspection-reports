2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is incomplete. There is insufficient detail on the PVC
regarding the method of parasite control. The PVC does not indicate when or how often the animals will receive
treatment with Ivermectin or Fenbendazole. The dosage chart for these medications provided by the attending
veterinarian also does not indicate when/how often the animals should be treated.
***The PVC states that the method of euthanasia is a “CO2 tank” and that euthanasia will be performed by the
registrant. The store manager stated that employees are no longer responsible for euthanizing the animals; all
euthanasia is now performed by the veterinarian. The method of euthanasia on the PVC must be updated to the
current method utilized by the facility.
The PVC is a written agreement between the exhibitor and the attending veterinarian establishing standards of care
for the animals. Failure to have a complete PVC could jeopardize the health and well-being of the animals. The
facility should establish and maintain an updated PVC to include all the regulated animals at the facility and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises.

SANITATION.
***The primary enclosure of three sugar gliders (2 adults and one baby) was located on the floor of a back room of
the pet store. The floor area surrounding the primary enclosure contained an accumulation of debris, feces, and
dead insects. There were also several live ants on the floor next to the enclosure.
Accumulation of debris and trash near animal enclosures can lead to pest infestation, disease transmission,
reduced health of the animals, and may be an indication of substandard husbandry practices.(cid:9)Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed
in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
