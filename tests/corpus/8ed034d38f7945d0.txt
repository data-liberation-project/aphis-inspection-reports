2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Eight adult Shih Tzu dogs had excessively matted hair over a large part of their bodies. (The licensee could not
provide identification for any of the dogs because her microchip scanner would not read the microchips and
because the "Dogs On Hand" inventory was not at the facility at the time of the inspection.) The eight dogs were a
brown and white female named "Crazy Eyes", a brown and white male without a name, a black female without a
name, a brown male named "Hershey", a yellow female named "Goldie", a brown and white male without a name,
and a yellow male without a name. Three of the dogs had twisted, matted hair on their faces that was irritating their
eyes. "Crazy Eyes" had cloudy corneas; a brown and white male had cloudy corneas with dry surfaces; and a black
female had thick discharge in the right eye as well as a watery discharge coming from the left eye. "Crazy Eyes"
and the brown and white male also had fecal material trapped in the matted hair under their tails.
Matted hair can result in skin and/or eye problems, can be painful, and can compromise the hair(cid:25)'s ability to provide
protection from the heat or cold. The licensee must remove the matted hair from these animals and must establish
an effective program of haircoat maintenance. TO BE CORRECTED BY MAY 30, 2016.

Eye problems can progress rapidly, can be painful, and can result in loss of vision. The licensee must have the
three dogs with eye problems examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment and must provide inspectors
with written documentation upon request. TO BE CORRECTED BY MAY 28, 2016.
2.50(b)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee could not provide identification for any of the dogs because her microchip scanner would not read the
microchips and because the "Dogs On Hand" inventory was not at the facility at the time of the inspection. Dogs
must be correctly identified at all times. When a microchip is used, a functioning microchip reader must be
available. Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to
facilitate record keeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The
licensee must identify all live regulated animals and assure that records are kept at all times.TO BE CORRECTED BY JUNE 03, 2016.
2.50(b)(3)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Three 14-week-old Yorkshire Terrier puppies were housed together in one enclosure. They were from three
different litters, but two of the puppies had no individual identification. The licensee stated that the third puppy had
a microchip, but the reader was not functioning, so it could not be correctly identified. Puppies less than 16 weeks
of age shall be identified. Proper and accurate identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's
identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements for inventory, disposition,
transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must identify all regulated animals and assure that records
are kept at all times.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JUNE 03, 2016.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
Inside the whelp building was an open bag of dog food on the floor. The food in the bag was currently being used
to feed dogs. The bag had a zip-lock type of closure at the top, but the closure was not being used and the contents
of the bag were exposed. Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from
spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. All opened supplies of food must be kept in leakproof containers
with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage. The licensee must ensure that food is stored properly
at all times.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MAY 27, 2016. (NOTE: The licensee closed the bag during the inspection.)
3.6(a)(2)(5)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The ground in 2 outdoor enclosures was very wet and muddy. It had been raining heavily and the drainage in these
enclosures appeared to be inadequate. In one enclosure, the feet and legs of the 3 dogs were muddy and wet. In
another enclosure, 2 dogs were very muddy and wet on the legs, belly and chest. The white dog had muddy matted
hair on the chest area. The brown and white dog had mud encrusted matted hair. Wet, muddy ground surfaces
cause an unhealthy environment for the dogs by not allowing the dogs to be dry and clean. The mud can stick to
the hair and cause discomfort. The constantly wet surfaces can make the dogs susceptible to irritating skin
conditions. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so the dogs to
remain dry and clean. TO BE CORRECTED BY MAY 30, 2016.
3.9(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
Inside the whelp building were 4 feed receptacles that contained moldy dog food. Two of the receptacles contained
the only food source for 3 young weaned Chihuahua puppies and the other two receptacles were in empty
enclosures. The food was entirely covered with a furry, greenish type mold. Moldy food has no nutritional value for
the dogs and may cause illness or death, if eaten. The licensee must ensure that the dogs are offered food that is
uncontaminated, wholesome, palatable, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the normal
condition and weight of the animal at all times. The moldy food must be removed and the receptacles cleaned and
sanitized before being used again.
TO BE CORRECTED ON MAY 26, 2016. (NOTE: The licensee removed the receptacles during the inspection.)
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor enclosures had an excessive amount of feces. The dogs had been walking through the feces and
packing it into the gravel surface. The dogs could not avoid the fecal matter when walking in the enclosures. Feces
in three of the enclosures was dried and covered with a white, furry mold indicating that the feces was several days
old. The licensee stated that she and her husband had been gone on vacation for the past six days and cleaning
was not done consistently during that time. Excessive feces and other waste can attract pests and can harbor
organisms that can create an unhealthy environment for the dogs.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily or as often as necessary to prevent an
excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs, and to reduce disease hazards,
insects, pests and odors. The enclosures must be cleaned and maintained on a daily basis.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MAY 27, 2016.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and Katy Vernon-ACI. The report was
hand-delivered and a second exit briefing was conducted on May 27, 2016, with the licensee and Katy Vernon-ACI.
