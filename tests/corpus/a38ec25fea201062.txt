2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
Two handling incidents occurred on August 27, 2019, resulting in vole deaths:
A vole developed seizure-like activity after a cage change and died. Internal investigation concluded that trauma
sustained during the cage change was likely the cause of death.
A vole was placed in the wrong cage with a different social group. The mistake was identified and the cage was monitored
but a vole was found dead with wounds consistent with fighting 2 days later.
Inappropriate handling by the animal care technicians resulted in the death of these 2 Voles.
Handling shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical harm.
At the time of inspection, corrective actions and preventatives measures had been implemented.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
