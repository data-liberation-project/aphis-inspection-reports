FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Outdoor Goat Pen: There were sections of wire fencing material attached to wooden posts located within the
enclosure which were bent, loose and in disrepair resulting in gaps and several, sharp, protruding wire ends.
Additionally, a long, metal nail was protruding from a wooden post and the pointed ends of at least two pieces of
wire were protruding inward along the enclosure fence. Openings or gaps in wire fencing poses the risk of an
animal getting parts of their body caught, trapped or injured. Also, sharp, protruding points or edges in areas of
contact with the animals may lead to injury.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges or other hazards in order to
protect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and
maintenance must be in place.
