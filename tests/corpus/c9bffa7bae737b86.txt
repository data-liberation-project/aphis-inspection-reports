Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Records reviewed during this inspection indicate that the PI deviated significantly from the IACUC protocol 15-052. In
February 2022, Mannitol – a drug not listed in the protocol - was given. On at least three occasions surgical procedures
were not performed as described in the protocol. Deviation from the IACUC-approved protocol can jeopardize the health
and well-being of the animals in the study, in addition to potentially altering the outcome of the study which could
invalidate the entire purpose of the study and therefore the use of these animals. Regarding activities involving animals,
the IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or withhold approval of those
components of proposed activities related to the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
At the time of inspection it was discovered that the surgical method for the "array" procedure lacked step-by-step details
regarding chamber implantation (and removal of) being performed under Protocol 15-052. Lack of a complete description
on intended animal use could expose the animals to unnecessary and harmful procedures that could adversely impact


their health and well-being. A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make a significant change in an
ongoing activity involving animals, must contain a complete description of the proposed use for the animals. The facility
had the PI amend the protocol where it now includes a complete, detailed explanation of the "array" procedure, and the
chamber implantation is no longer apart of the protocol.

Correction Date: To be corrected from this day forward

Personnel qualifications.
Records reviewed during this inspection indicate that the PI on Protocol 15-052 had issues with his surgical skills which
(between March 2018 and July 2022) resulted in NHP’s having to undergo multiple repair procedures and endure surgical
procedures which lasted much longer than normal. One NHP died on December 10, 2020, after the investigator made a
surgical error that resulted in the penetration of the dura during chamber placement surgery. The research facility did not
review the qualifications of lab personnel conducting these procedures with sufficient frequency to ensure they were
qualified to perform their duties. The qualifications of personnel shall be reviewed with sufficient frequency to fulfill the
research facility’s responsibilities under sections 2.32 and 2.31. The IACUC investigated these incidents and determined
the PI must be retrained, along with pre-, during, and post-operative communications between the research and
veterinary staff.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.


The veterinarian witnessed lab personnel on protocol 15-052 reusing needles and syringes to flush the skin on the head
post of a NHP, and lab personnel on protocol PROTO201800039 fail to leave brain probes in solutions used for cold
sterilization for a long enough time to achieve sterilization. As a result, three NHP’s experienced CNS signs and brain
abscesses - two of which had to be euthanized because of the severity of their condition. Upon discussion with the
veterinarians, it was determined that the lab employees never received official training for utilization of aseptic techniques
regarding the aseptic procedures. Failure to provide guidance to lab personnel on the aseptic principles necessary to
appropriately handle the animals for these research procedures resulted in the use of an improper technique that
negatively impacted the health and well-being of these animals. Each research facility shall establish and maintain
programs of adequate veterinary care that include guidance to principal investigators and other personnel involved in the
care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization, and euthanasia. The
facility held a meeting to review the process and aseptic techniques of all individuals who handle the animals, and has
also made pre-, during, and post-operative procedural upgrades and trainings.

2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
Despite guidance from the veterinarian to use drill guides when performing all cranial surgeries on protocol 15-052, the PI
failed to do so, leading to penetration of the dura of two NHP’s – one of which had to be euthanized. In addition, the
veterinarian also advised the PI to use less surgical cement on another NHP under this protocol due to concerns
regarding wound healing and infections. However, according to the veterinarian the PI failed to follow this advice, resulting
in excessive skin margin regression (around the cranial hardware) and an infection. Lastly, records indicate that on March
23, 2021, a Rhesus macaque - under protocol PROTO201800039 - experienced anesthetic complications. Revival


attempts were not successful when she was mistakenly given an anesthetic (Anased) rather than the reversal drug
Antisedan. Failure to properly handle the animals [as directed] can negatively impact their health and well-being. Handling
of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral
stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Corrective actions taken by the facility regarding the drug mix-up
included training and no longer ordering Anased to avoid confusion with Antisedan.
