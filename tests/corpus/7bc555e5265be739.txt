ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee allowed local animal control officers to euthanize a whitetail deer at the facility on June 26, 2015. The
circumstances were that the licensee used ketamine to tranquilize and/or sedate the animal. The licensee was not
able to tell the inspectors the euthanasia drug used. The euthanasia material was administered IC (intra-cardiac) by
the animal control officers according to the licensee. The current program of veterinary care does not state that
euthanasia can be carried out by these persons and does not list this method as an approved method by the
attending veterinarian. The program of veterinary care did not indicate who would be performing the methods of
euthanasia nor the species to be euthanized. The program lists the use of (cid:28)pentobarbital IV or IM(cid:29) with no dosage.
The attending veterinarian must approve in writing the methods of euthanasia to be performed, who will perform the
euthanasia of regulated species and said persons must be properly trained in the methods of euthanasia. It should
also reflect drug name, route and dosage.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The back wall of the bobcat enclosure has rusted and started flaking off at the bottom of the wall. Rust prevents it
from being properly sanitized. The flaking of the rust has exposed sharp points that can potentially cause harm to
the animal enclosed.
The zebra enclosure has a wooden fence inside the main enclosure that has rotted and sections of the fence are
partially down. On one of the sections, there is a piece of the wooden fence that has broken and exposed pointed
end. The exposed broken pieces of the fence can be hazardous to the animals enclosed and potentially cause
injury. The enclosure must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
The capybara enclosure has an empty pool that is not in use. The licensee has put plywood on top of the pool to
cover it. The corners of the plywood have been chewed on excessively causing the plywood to curl up exposing
large gaps into the empty pool. There are exposed screws that had held the plywood down that are exposed. Thegaps in the plywood are large enough for the animal enclosed to fall into and can potentially cause injury to the
animals enclosed.
Licensee must maintain outdoor facilities so that it is structurally sound and in good repair to protect animals from
injury.
