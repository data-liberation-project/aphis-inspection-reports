ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The three capybaras all had hair loss in an approximately 2 inch oblong area on the top of their heads. Two of the
areas appeared red and irritated. Two adult female cattle were very skinny with ribs and pelvic bones prominent.
Hair loss and weight loss can be signs of illness or injury which can lead to pain, suffering or death.
Adequate veterinary care to prevent, control, diagnosis and treat disease and injuries must be provided to prevent
pain and suffering.
To be corrected immediately.

2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One male Guanaco was observed to be limping on its right front leg during inspection. The licensee had previously
observed the Guanaco's condition and the animal had been seen by the Attending Veterinarian a week ago, but the
animal's condition had gotten worse since the Attending Veterinarian had been out and the licensee had not
observed this. The Guanaco was struggling just moving around in the enclosure and it was non-weight bearing
when standing. It had an extremely abnormal gait.
Not thoroughly observing all the animals on a daily basis does not ensure that veterinary care issues will be
immediately recognized or in this case, that the veterinary care issue has gotten worse since it was last seen by the
Attending Veterinarian. By not recognizing or observing that a condition has gotten worse, it doesn't allow for the
Attending Veterinarian to update the treatment plan. Observations must be conducted on a daily basis. Any health
issues identified or observed to have gotten worse during daily observations should either be reported to the
Attending Veterinarian or the licensee must refer to the Program of Veterinary Care for any treatments written up
and approved by the Attending Veterinarian. Correct immediately.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. Several areas have sharp points and wires that are protruding into the pens which could cause injury to the animals.

These areas included the fence line and siding on the shelter in the male sheep (4)/goat (4) pen, feeder panels
along the south side of feeding area of adult yak (1)/ cattle (1) pen, and a broken feeder in the alpaca (5) pen.
All enclosures or facilities for all the animals must be constructed of such material and of such strength as
appropriate for the animals involved. All facilities must be structurally sound, free from sharp, protruding points or
edges, and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to properly contain them. A
system of timely identification, maintenance, and repair of facilities must be in place to ensure the health and
well-being of all animals.
Broken feeder was removed at time of inspection.

WATERING.
An enclosure containing three red foxes had a watering bowl that had not been changed in a week. The water was
dark green with floating debris. Unsanitary water could be contaminated with various types of parasites which could
cause illness or disease for the animals. All watering receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. From here on
out, the water needs to be changed on a more regular basis so gunk doesn't build up and the water doesn't change
to a greenish color. Correct immediately.
Note: The licensee changed cleaned out this watering bowl during the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
