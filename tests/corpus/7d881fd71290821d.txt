wide. Her right ear also has a notch taken out of the tip that is about ¼ in. in diameter. It is a fresh cut that was
bleeding slightly.

These health issues had not been observed by the licensee before the inspection.
Daily observation of each animal is important to assess the health and well-being of the animals.

The licensee must ensure that each animal is observed at least daily, and there is direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian for any problems with their behavior and/or health and well-being.To be corrected from this day forward.
3.3(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The sheltered housing facility lighting is too dim. There are several light bulbs that are not functioning properly, and
there are not enough light fixtures for the size of the building. The inspectors had to use a flashlight on many
occasions to better see the facility and animals.
Proper lighting is important for the daily observation of the animals, to ensure proper cleaning, and to facilitate the
inspection process.
The licensee must ensure that all facilities are well-lit to aid in maintaining good housekeeping practices, adequate
cleaning, inspection of the animals, and for the animal's well-being.
To be corrected by November 9, 2014.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the sheltered housing facility, the inside of a majority of the self-feeders have a brownish-black grime buildup that
indicates they are not being cleaned and sanitized often enough.
Proper cleaning and sanitization of feeders kills disease pathogens that could affect the animal's health.
The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are kept clean and are sanitized at least once every two weeks
with a method prescribed in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, or as often as necessary to prevent a buildup of grime,
debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
To be corrected by October 11, 2014.
3.11(b)(3)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
All hard surfaces of the primary enclosures in the facility are not being sanitized often enough. The licensee stated
that it is sanitized with detergents approximately once a month.Sanitization of all hard surfaces in contact with the animals is important to kill pathogens and reduce disease
hazards.
The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces of primary enclosures and food and water receptacles are sanitized
using either live steam under pressure, using hot water of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82.2 degrees Celsius)
and soap or detergent, or washing with detergent solutions and disinfectants or other products that accomplish the
same purpose, with a thorough cleaning of the surfaces to remove all organic material and mineral buildup and to
provide sanitization followed by a clean water rinse.
