REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
Records indicate the intermediate handler's registration was not renewed and was thereafter canceled in June
2015. Between August and December 2015, it was discovered via inspection of records from other licensed facilities
that the intermediate handler (or an agent acting on his behalf) transported at least 1241 animals to destinations
within and outside the state. All of these transportations occurred without an active registration. It is critical for
intermediate handlers to maintain their registration with USDA to allow adequate regulatory oversight. The registrant
shall file an updated registration form every 3 years to maintain their status with USDA.
Correct by re-registering with the USDA as an intermediate handler prior to any further transportation of regulated
animals.
Note: the intermediate handler is no longer transporting regulated animals in commerce as of March 2015.
However, if transportation is to resume, the registrant must re-register prior to conducting any regulated activity.
The inspection of records was conducted from November 23, 2015 through January 8, 2016. An exit interview was
conducted with the registrant on February 8, 2016, by the undersigned VMO.
