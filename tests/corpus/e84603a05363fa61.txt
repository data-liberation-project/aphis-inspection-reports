2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The licensee has been conducting regulated activity out of sites that have not been approved. The licensee had been
informed multiple times in the past that these sites needed to be approved prior to conducting regulated activity from
them.
Conducting regulated activity from unapproved locations does not ensure the welfare of the animals which could result in
non-compliant living conditions and inadequate veterinary care.
A licensee shall notify Animal Care no fewer than 90 days and obtain a new license before any change name, address,
control or ownership of the business or operation, locations, activities, and number or types of animals. The licensee
must notify Animal Care of any new locations where he houses dogs used for regulated purposes in order to ensure the
Animal Welfare Act can be properly enforced.
To be corrected by: From this day forward the licensee must provide the locations of all facilities housing dogs used for
regulated purposes.
2.126(a) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
Upon arriving at an unlicensed facility to conduct a search for regulated activity, APHIS officials spoke to the facility
representative who stated the dogs belonged to the licensee and confirmed that regulated activity occurred at the

location. The inspector called the licensee to request permission for the facility representative to conduct the inspection.
The licensee refused to allow APHIS officials to inspect the facility and the dogs. The inspector explained to the licensee
that he would be cited for refusing the inspection if he did not allow an inspection to take place. The licensee still refused
the inspection of the unlicensed site.
Refusing to allow inspections of regulated animals does not permit APHIS officials to enforce the Animal Welfare Act and
to confirm the living conditions, veterinary care and the overall welfare of the dogs.
Each dealer shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to inspect the facilities, property, records and animals.
The licensee must allow APHIS officials to inspect all facilities and animals used for regulated purposes in order to
confirm compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.
To be corrected by: The licensee must provide access to all facilities and animals for inspection from this day forward.
