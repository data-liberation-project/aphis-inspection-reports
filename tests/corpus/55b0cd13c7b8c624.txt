ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 on
15-Aug-16.One of the park employees attempted to contact the pertinent personnel, but it was indicated that both
the authorized contacts, the park manager and assistant manager, were out of the office and would not return within
the next 30 minutes.
Lack of availability renders the inspection process impossible. The licensee must ensure that a facility
representative is available to accompany APHIS Inspectors during normal business hours.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 15, 2016.
