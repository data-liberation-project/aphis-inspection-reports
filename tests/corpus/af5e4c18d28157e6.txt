was curling into the other hoof.

Handling of animals.
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development reported a bite incident to the inspector on August 8,
2022. A pot-bellied pig at the facility bit a child on July 29, 2022. There was no public barrier, and the attendant available
was not able to prevent the child from being bit.

During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals
and the public.


If an attendant is not effective in preventing an animal from biting a member of the public, there must be sufficient
distance and/or barriers to assure the safety of the animals and the public.

Housing facilities, general.
An outdoor enclosure, housing 4 ring-tailed lemurs, was composed of woven wire with 4in x 2in holes. One lemur was
observed sticking its entire head and neck through one of the holes.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the
species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from
injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.
Appropriate housing for the nonhuman primate must be provided and maintained to prevent injury or death to the animals.

entire heads through the holes in the fence.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
Appropriate housing for the species must be provided and maintained to prevent injury or death to the animals.
