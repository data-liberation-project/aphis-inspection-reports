2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male black bear “Reed” was observed with patchy hair loss and thinning of hair on the neck and back. The facility
stated this was a seasonal occurrence for this bear and since it does not seem to impact the other 2 bears in the
enclosure, they have not communicated his condition to the AV for assessment and possible treatment options.

A geriatric black bear “Grizz” was placed at the facility with previously identified mobility issues approximately a year ago.
Despite the animal exhibiting limited mobility and stiffness in his gait, no additional communication with the AV has
occurred for reassessment of his condition. Additionally, this animal is in an enclosure that has a concrete floor and
limited space, that can worsen his mobility issues.

A fisher was observed to have hair loss beginning at the base of the tail to nearly the end of the tail. The facility stated that
this was normal for this animal and has not communicated his condition to the AV for proper diagnosis and treatment
options.

A geriatric Coyote approximately 14 years old was observed to be stiff and moving slowly when moving from a laying to

standing body position. The Coyote was also observed to have lameness in the rear left leg when walking. The facility has
not communicated his worsening mobility issues to the AV for potential treatment options.

Although daily observation is occurring, the facility employees considered the above mentioned animal conditions
“normal” for that particular animal and therefore these issues have not been conveyed to the AV in a timely manner. The
facility needs to put mechanisms in place to not only observe animals daily but also recognize when animal health or well-
being is compromised. That information should be communicated in a timely and accurate manner to the attending
veterinarian so determinations on appropriate methods of preventative care and treatment under 2.40(b)(2) are
implemented.

Facilities, general.
The buried chain link in the Boar and Red fox enclosures are in disrepair. There are areas that protrude out of the ground
exposing sharp ends of the chain link and holes in the exposed wire. There are various areas in the enclosures with
damaged areas that measure less than a foot to approximately 3 feet.
The exposed sharp points on the chain link can lead to lacerations on the animals. The bent loops that have formed could
lead to entrapment.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals and to keep the
enclosures structurally sound.

Space requirements.
The facility acquired a geriatric male black bear “Grizz”, he is being kept in an approximately 10-foot-wide and 20-foot-
long concrete shifting area to the left of the main enclosure. A small wooden pallet is also in the holding area. This bear
has limited mobility made worse by the concrete floor of the enclosure. This den area does not provide sufficient space to
allow him to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement which is displayed by his
lack of movement and poor condition. They are unable to introduce him to the trio of younger bears being housed in the
large main exhibit where the trio is displayed.

A three-year-old female coyote was locked in a shifting area to the right of her main enclosure. Inspectors were told this is
because she had been aggressive to the older male coyote. At the time of the inspection, she was frantically running
around the enclosure, jumping on the back ledge and as the inspectors came closer, she froze in the left back corner.
This holding area is in full view of the guest walkway and she has no place to hide in this area. Her current behavior
pattern indicates high levels of stress likely due to the small size and her inability to engage in normal postural
movements and social adjustments including hiding.

Despite the generally large exhibition enclosures provided for the species, the facility does not have enough space for
when animals become incompatible. Due to the incompatibility of these groups of animals with the female Coyote and
“Grizz”, these individuals are now housed in den areas that do not meet space requirements for the species.

The facility must have a plan for how these animals can be provided adequate space that reduces stress and meets their
needs.
