3.80(a)(2)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** A Ringtmail leumur was found outside of its enclosure sitting on the public barrier fence during this inspection.
The licensee stated that the lemur has been able to escape from its enclosure occasionally and they are currently
trying to determine how it is able to get out. The licensee returned the lemur to the primary enclosure during this
inspection. Failure to provide enclosures that properly contain the animals puts the animals and the public at risk
or injury. The facility must determine the route of escape this lemur is using and make repairs or improvements to
the enclosure to prevent escape.
