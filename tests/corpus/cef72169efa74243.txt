2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Cairn terrier (tag #51) has excessively long, overgrown toenails. The toenails of both front feet are curling
under and when the dog stands on the solid flooring her toenails lay sideways across the floor. Overgrown toenails
could cause pain and discomfort as well as affect the dog(cid:25)'s natural gait.
The licensee must have this dog's toenails trimmed to an acceptable length in order to promote her health and
well-being. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate toenail care and maintenance at all times.

In the "Whelping" building there are multiple bottles of expired medical materials stored with non-expired medical
materials. A bottle containing Amoxicillin expired January 2016, one bottle of Ivermectin oral expired September
2014, one bottle of Gentamicin Sulfate expired January 2016, and one bottle of Benadryl expired December 2015.
Expired medical material could lose their effectiveness and the health of the dogs could suffer.
The licensee must either dispose of all such materials or move them to an appropriately labeled, physically separate
location from non-expired medical materials. The licensee must ensure that no medical materials for the dogs have
expired.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Semi" the last enclosure has a metal access door that is only attached by one bottom hinge. The access
door should be attached by three hinges but the top hinge and the middle hinge are missing. The door leaned out
into the enclosure as the dogs went through it and the door sits at an angle when it is shut. There are six dogs
housed in this enclosure. The lack of hinges causes this door to function improperly which could result in injury to
the dogs.Housing facilities for dogs must be constructed and designed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept
in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The licensee must repair, replace, or alter the door in a manner
that makes it safe for the dogs to use. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all
times.

3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Throughout the facility there are multiple enclosures containing sharp points. In the "Whelping" building there is one
enclosure, containing four puppies, which the chain link on the gate has broken creating sharp points at the level of
the puppies. In another enclosure, where the side fence panel connects to the gate, the chain link has broken near
the floor creating a sharp point. There is one adult dog in this enclosure. Two enclosures, containing a total of 2
adult dogs and one puppy, has broken chain link along the bottom of a side fence panel creating several sharp
points at the level of the dogs. One enclosure, containing one adult dog and six puppies, has sharp points created
by the ends of the wire used to attach the water bucket to the fence.
In the "Semi" there is one enclosure, containing three adult dogs, which has sharp wires from the fencing protruding
into the enclosure on both sides of the access door. Another enclosure, containing at least three adult dogs, has
multiple sharp points running up one end of a fence panel. The enclosure that shares this fence panel also has at
least one sharp point protruding into it at the level of the dogs. There are at least two adult dogs in this enclosure.
Sharp points can cause injury to the dogs.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points that could injure the
dogs. The licensee must remove or alter all the sharp points in a manner that eliminates the injury risk towards the
dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain safe for the dogs at all times.
