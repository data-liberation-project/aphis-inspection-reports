2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have complete acquisition and disposition records. There were no acquisition records for the ferrets,
guinea pigs, rabbits, alpacas, and sheep. Additionally, no disposition records were available for the East African oryx.
Acquisition and disposition records, including offspring born at the facility, are necessary to accurately track animals being
used in regulated activities.
The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition/disposition of all animals that fully and correctly
disclose the required information.

3.27(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility currently houses guinea pigs outdoors without prior approval from the Deputy Administrator. Though the
temperature was mild during this inspection, the facility is in an area where temperature extremes occur in the winter and
summer months.
Housing guinea pigs in unsuitable environments can jeopardize their health and cause significant stress, especially as a


prey species. Guinea pigs shall not be housed outdoors unless such facilities are located in an appropriate climate and
prior approval for outdoor housing is obtained from the Deputy Administrator.

3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Two guinea pig primary enclosures are constructed of unsealed wood. Bare wood must be sealed or covered with a
surface that is impervious to moisture, allowing surfaces to be cleaned and sanitized sufficiently.
Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs and hamsters
from injury. Such enclosures, including their racks, shelving and other accessories, shall be constructed of smooth
material substantially impervious to liquids and moisture.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility does not have an updated perimeter fence variance to include the red kangaroo, African crested porcupine,
Patagonian cavies, and capybara. The variance request needs to be updated and resubmitted to reflect these species
and any others planned to be housed here with appropriate alternative security measures employed.
Having a perimeter fence in place protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from
going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally, it serves as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility.
The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact


between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Fences less than 3 feet in
distance from the primary enclosure, less than 8 feet high for dangerous animals, or less than 6 feet high for other
animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. Use of an effective natural barrier to protect the outdoor
housing facilities must also be approved in writing by the Administrator.

3.130 Direct

Watering.
Three separate primary enclosures housing llamas, alpacas, and a dromedary camel did not have clean drinking water.
The area housing two llamas and two alpacas had a water bucket containing dark brown, thickened water with clumps of
straw floating throughout.
An enclosure housing twenty llamas had three buckets of brown, discolored, cloudy water. The enclosure housing one
dromedary camel also had water that was brown in color, with a congealed film overlying the top. The water was
significantly cloudy, unable to see through to the bottom of the bucket. Though the licensee stated the discoloration of the
receptacles were attributed to minerals naturally found in the water system, the water receptacles had excessive buildup
that had not been cleaned or replaced as needed.
The consumption of unclean drinking water can compromise an animal’s health or cause severe illness. Accessibility to
potable water is necessary for health, sustenance, and well-being of the animal. All water receptacles must be kept clean
and sanitary.
