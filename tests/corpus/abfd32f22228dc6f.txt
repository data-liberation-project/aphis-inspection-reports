outside door , a hole in the floor, and the floor air vent has no cover. These are areas that may allow the entry of
rodents or other pests. The open air vent is an area that an animal could fall into if there was an escape. This

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
While reviewing animal records, it was discovered that a prairie dog had died from internal trauma. This occurred
when the animals were placed in a new exhibit and one prairie dog was able to scale the exhibit and enter the
armadillo enclosure where it was killed. Enclosures must be built to safely contain the animals housed in them.
After this incident, the wall separating the two enclosures was raised to prevent future incidents.
