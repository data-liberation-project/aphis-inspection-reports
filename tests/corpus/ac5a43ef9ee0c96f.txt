SANITATION.
There was excessive accumulation of feces, dust and hair under the wired flooring of the rabbit enclosures. The
fecal accumulation is a potential for disease hazard, and creates a favorable environment for insects and other
pests. The enclosures must be cleaned, and the registrant must develop and maintain a cleaning program that will
prevent the accumulation of debris, cobwebs, hair and excess feces from becoming excessive.
