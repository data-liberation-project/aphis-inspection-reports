ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Although the licensee has written out the veterinary care she provides the opossum, she has not had the written
Program of Veterinary Care completed, reviewed, and approved by an Attending Veterinarian. This needs to be
done to assure adequate veterinary care is provided.
This is a pre-use new site inspection. The above item needs to be corrected and reviewed by USDA before this site
can conduct regulated activity.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee wildlife rehabilitator representative.
