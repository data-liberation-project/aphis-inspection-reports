ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The current program of veterinary care lists an attending veterinarian who has not been to the facility in over a
year. The facility is utilizing another veterinarian for puppy checks and routine care consultation. This veterinarian is
not listed on the program of veterinary care. The facility needs to designate one veterinarian to oversee herd health
of the kennel and who is aware of preventative protocols, treatment plans and dental care. All veterinarians
consulted by facility need to be listed on program of veterinary care to ensure attending veterinarian is given the
authority to oversee the adequacy of all aspects of veterinary care.

***White cavachon puppy in whelping box identified as 17157 had hind right leg held out straight to right side of
body in whelping box. Puppy did not appear to have traction on smooth surface of whelping box floor. Puppy was
picked up, and did not appear to be able to bend right hind leg. When placed on a concrete surface with better
traction, the puppy did not bend leg, pull leg under body, or use leg to ambulate. This puppy may have an injury,
and due to the potential severity of injury and age of puppy, this condition should be communicated to the attending
veterinarian as soon as possible to mitigate potential negative effects on puppy development.
