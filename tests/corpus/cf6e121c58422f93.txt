injuries it received The Rottweiller escaped it(cid:25)'s enclosure through an unsecured door and was able to enter the
enclosure with the Labradoodle. There are several doors on the enclosures for the German Shepherds, Bull
Mastiffs, Wheaton Terriers and Shiba-Inu that are not adequately secured and may allow the dogs to escape or get
stuck and injured trying to push through the unsecured doors. The unsecured doors may also allow unwanted
animals to gain access and cause injury or death to the dogs. All of the enclosure doors must be sufficiently
secured to contain the dogs securely, protect the dogs from injury and restrict other animals from entering to protect
the health, safety and welfare of the animals. TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
3.11(a)The indoor facility housing 13 adult dogs and 7 puppies had an accumulation of wet grime and fecal material on the
floors. The majority of the dogs could not avoid contact with their own excreta. Animals that are in constant contact
with excreta have an increased opportunity of having internal parasites and spreading disease. The licensee shall
remove excreta from the enclosures daily and provide routine cleaning and sanitization that prevents the animals
from becoming soiled and reduces disease hazards. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 3/16/2014
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
3.11(d) The inspectors observed accumulations of rodent droppings throughout the building housing the dogs.
There are rodent droppings inside the primary enclosures for several of the dogs, along the walls, in corners and
near the food storage area. A rodent carcass was also observed in a corner. Rodents and the waste associated
with them can be a disease hazard, Droppings and the rodents may contaminate food which could sicken the dogs.
An effective program to control pests such as rodents must be established and maintained to promote the health
and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by the pests in the animal areas.
