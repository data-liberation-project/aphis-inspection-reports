Handling of animals.
On November 17, 2020 a child was bitten during an encounter with the lemurs. The lemur "Peach" was attempting to grab
the child's mask and bit her on the left cheek. The child was administered first aid by the mother at the the time of the
incident. The facility documented the incident and quarantined the lemur. The child reportedly was taken to the hospital
for treatment. The facility was unable to assure the safety of both the public and the animal. While handling the animals
there shall be minimal risk of harm to the public. Safety measures should be implemented to prevent the injury of both
animals and the public while exhibiting. Correct from this day forward.

Facilities, outdoor.
There were guinea pigs being housed in a barn. Inside the barn there were other primary enclosures housing the petting
zoo animals and the giraffe. The temperature at the time of the inspection was 77 degrees F at about 4:00 pm. The barn
was insulated along with ceiling fans and the doors of the barn were open. The animals appeared healthy and no one was
exhibiting any signs of discomfort. The facility had an approval letter from their attending veterinarian addressing their
ability to house the animals in an outdoor enclosure but failed to produce the letter from Animal Care's Deputy
Administrator approving the outdoor housing for the guinea pigs. Although the guinea pigs did not appear to be in any


pain or distress, there was no documentation of prior approval from the Deputy Administrator approving the animals to be
housed outdoors. The facility must obtain required approval or provide indoor facilities for the animals to assure they are
properly acclimated to the temperatures of outdoor housing and prevent discomfort. Correct by May 6, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
