SANITATION.
A large number of flies were present within the outdoor, enclosure housing five pigs. The flies were observed on
the outside and inside of the shelter structures as well as on the face of one of the pigs. Although there was a fly
trap hung in the area, the pest control program for this area is ineffective. Additionally, next to this enclosure there
was a plastic container of pelleted pig feed with several, small brownish colored insects observed on the inside
walls of the container. Pests such as flies or other insects may cause irritation or discomfort to the animals, pose a
health risk to the animals and may contaminate food supplies. An effective pest control program must be
established and maintained to promote the health and well-being of the animals.
