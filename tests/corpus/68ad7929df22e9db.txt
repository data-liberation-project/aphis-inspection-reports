2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white adult female pot-bellied pig with no identification, has fly bites on the tip of both ears. Each ear has an open
sore that is approximately one quarter inch in size. The sores are moist and bright red in color. Numerous flies are
present on the affected areas of both ears. The facility representative was not aware of the wounds but applied
(cid:28)"Corona(cid:29)" (a topical ointment containing 30% lanolin) to the pig's ears after the fly bites were identified by the
inspector. Fly bites to the ears can be painful and cause discomfort for the pig. Fly bites to the ears can lead to open
sores which can cause further disease risk or infection for the animal. It can also lead the ear being inflamed. Left
untreated it could delay the healing process affecting the health and well being of the animal. Fly bite ears need to
receive veterinarian care to prevent further biting and then the ears can start to heal. The licensee must have this
animal examined by a veterinarian and administer an appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this exam must
be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
