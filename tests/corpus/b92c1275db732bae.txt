SANITATION.
In the camel/alpaca pasture near the house, the wire fencing fabric wrapped around the trees is damaged to the
point that most of the trees have broken wires and sharp points projecting outward. The animals obviously rub on
the wire placed to prevent their chewing on the trees. The broken wires now pose a risk of injury to the animals.
The wire needs to be repaired, replaced, or removed to prevent injury to the animals in the enclosure.
Correct in 45 days, by 8/28/2017.
