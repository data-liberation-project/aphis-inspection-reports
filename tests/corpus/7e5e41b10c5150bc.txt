2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available during this inspection. Approximately 259 adult guinea pigs and
93 newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records maintained for several months. Failure
to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal losses by
decreased number of guinea pigs born or raised. The licensee must maintain records containing the required information
for animals which discloses the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired, or disposed of including births and deaths.

Sanitation.
Pest control. Mouse droppings were present along the wall in the office and in the guinea pig room. There were
accumulations of spilled dog food and guinea pig feed on the floor by stacked bags of feed. No pest control measures
were noted in the animal building. Wild rodents and pests can expose guinea pigs to disease risks. Removing spilled feed
from the floor and hiding areas can help to control pests problems. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective
pest control program to control wild mice. Corrected by September 22, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
