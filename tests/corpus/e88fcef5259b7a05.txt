CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The adult primary enclosures consisted of elevated coated wire kennels with no exterior access and several tiled
floor-level kennels with exterior access to concrete runs.
There was an excessive amount of excreta, and food waste underneath each of the elevated kennels covering
approximately 30% of the floor surface.
On the interior tile surfaces and the exterior outdoor surfaces of the floor-level kennels there was an excessive
accumulation of urine and feces covering approximately 10% of the floor surface.
It is important to remove excreta and food waste from the primary enclosures daily and from under primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent soiling of the dogs contained within the enclosures and to prevent
disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In addition to excessive amounts of excreta and food waste underneath the elevated kennels and within the tiled
floor-level kennels there was an accumulation of yellowish to reddish brown fluid within the gutters going to the
sanitary sewer drains which contributed to the overall poor odor of the facility.
Accumulations of dirt, debris, excreta, and food waste contribute to odors and other disease hazards for the
animals.
In addition to cleaning and removing excessive amounts of food and excreta, the primary enclosures must be
sanitized at least once every two (2) weeks.
