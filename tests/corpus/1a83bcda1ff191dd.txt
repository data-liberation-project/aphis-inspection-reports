2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current written program of veterinary care (PVC) signed on 9/2/16 by the attending veterinarian states that
Selemectin should be administered monthly to non-human primates for parasite control. The facility has no records
showing that Selemectin has been administered. The facility owner when asked when the last dose was applied first
stated (cid:28)in January(cid:29) and then later after the inspector showed her the PVC she amended it to (cid:28)in June(cid:29). The written
PVC also states that all new (cid:24)Old World and New World monkeys(cid:25) should be TB (tuberculosis) tested when
acquired. The facility has acquired 34 marmosets in the last couple of years (most of these in 2015/2016) from at
least three different facilities. No records of TB testing being done at this facility are available for review. One of the
facilities from whom 19 marmosets were acquired wrote a letter stating the marmosets came from a closed TB
negative colony however no testing was done at this facility. The attending veterinarian(cid:25)s office was contacted. They
stated that their computer did not have any record of any TB tests conducted or Selemectin purchased. A written
program of veterinary care completed by a facility(cid:25)s attending veterinarian states the measures to be used by a
facility to prevent and control internal and external parasites and contagious diseases such as TB. Failure to follow
the preventative measures may lead to disease and health issues. The facility shall ensure the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases as stipulated by the attending veterinarian in the written
program of veterinary care. Correct by Aug. 30, 2016.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The inspectors noted that the 7019 form listing the animals on hand is not complete nor up to date.
*The facility currently houses six hedgehogs-four adults and two young. The 7019 form lists nine adult hedgehogs
and no young. In addition records from two 2016 auctions show that the facility sold 25 hedgehogs in 2016. There
are no records to show where these hedgehogs were acquired/born.
*The 7019 forms reviewed listed 25 marmosets acquired in 2012-2014 with no corresponding disposition
information. 7020 acquisition forms showed 34 additional marmosets acquired in 2014-2016. Totaling these records
there are supposedly 59 marmosets at the facility. During the inspection we counted 39 marmosets. Thus either the
acquisition records are incorrect or there are missing disposition records. It is important to keep accurate and complete records in order to trace the health and the ownership of animals. The
acquisition and disposition records must be complete and include all the required information. Correct by Aug. 30,
2016.
3.77(f)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
A sheltered housing marmosets has been added to the site since the last inspection. The area has some fencing
that does not meet the six foot perimeter fence regulation for primates. The sheltered housing building requires a
perimeter fence at least six foot high which is at least three feet from the sheltered building or a variance approved
by the administrator. The administrator can approve a fence less than six feet high and less than three feet from the
sheltered building. It is important for the protection of the nonhuman primates to restrict access of unwanted animals
and unauthorized humans. Apply for a variance or construct a fence. Correct by October 31,2016.
3.80(b)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two adult marmosets are currently housed in an enclosure in the sheltered housing facility in which the floor space
of the indoor portion of the housing measures approximately 1ftx2ft providing floor space of 2 sq.ft. total. Two
marmosets require a total of 3.2 sq. ft. (1.6 sq. ft. per marmosetx2) of floor space. The marmosets do have access
to additional floor space in the outdoor portion of the sheltered facility however the outdoor portion provides no
shade or shelter from the elements required of outdoor housing to be considered adequate housing. Lack of
adequate floor space may lead to the inability of each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with
adequate freedom of movement. All primary enclosures housing marmosets must provide each marmoset 1.6 sq.ft.
of floor space. Correct by Aug. 19, 2016.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Inspection of the hedgehog enclosures showed dry cat food mixed into and sitting on top of wet urine and fecal
material contaminated shavings in the two enclosures that had not had their shavings replaced before the
inspectors arrived. The hedgehogs may choose not to eat the feed on the contaminated bedding and the excreta
contaminated feed may lead to spread of disease organisms if the feed is eaten. Food must be placed so as to
minimize contamination or clean food receptacles can be used. Correct by Aug. 22, 2016.
3.131(a)SANITATION.
There are five primary enclosures that are housing six hedgehogs which have aspen shavings for bedding in the
bottom of the enclosure. The shavings are very dirty and wet with several soiled areas which include excreta ,urine ,
and cat food. The plastic surfaces of the enclosure are soiled with excreta and the plastic hedgehog dome house
was soiled. One dead baby hedgehog was found in the soiled bedding. The room had a strong smell of ammonia
which permeated through out the animal area. It is important to make sure animal areas are cleaned and sanitized
correctly to prevent disease and odor. Correct by July 24,2016.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Numerous fruit flies were noted sitting on top of the bedding of all the hedgehog enclosures (both the (cid:24)clean(cid:25) and
the dirty bedding enclosures). In addition other larger housefly type flies were noted flying around the enclosures. A
strong ammonia odor was noted in the room and around the enclosures helping to attract the flies. Flies can be
discomforting to the animals and can spread disease hazards. The facility shall establish and maintain a safe and
effective program for the control of pests including flies. Correct by Aug. 10, 2016.
