ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One black and white racing pig was noted in an enclosure by itself. The pig exhibited a slight whole body tremor, a
wide based stance to the rear limbs and a stiff legged gait on the rear limbs. In addition, the ridges of the spines
were more prominent than on the other pigs. Staff reported that the pig had been used in races up until a couple of
days ago when it didn't want to run when the starting gate was opened. A veterinarian has not yet been contacted
about the pig. A veterinarian needs to be consulted to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan for the pig. The
facility shall consult with a veterinarian in order to ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat all animal diseases and injuries. Correct by 10/16/15.
