Facilities, general.
The following structural items were noted:
1) There is a hole and bent wire on a section of fence housing the wallabies, wallaroo, kangaroos, capybaras, cavy, and
tortoise enclosure near the smaller tortoise enclosure. The hole is approximately 2 feet by one foot high. There is also
door near this hole in the fence with protruding screws with sharp points about one inch in length sticking in towards the
wallaby, wallaroo, kangaroo, capybara, cavy, and tortoise enclosure about a foot off the ground.

2) The sandy soil has washed out around and behind the capybara pool causing a large hole to form underneath the back

fence. Straw bales are currently blocking the large hole.

3) There is a chewed electric wire hanging from the back porch of the owner’s house in the enclosure housing the
wallabies, wallaroo, kangaroos, capybaras, and tortoise enclosure. The electric also runs underneath the back porch.

4) There are two broken and burned support posts supporting the fence along the driveway housing the water buffalo,
zebras, wildebeest, and nilgai.

5) A large tree has taken out a large 12 to 15 foot section of fence in the back pasture housing the llamas, alpacas, cows,
horses, pigs, sheep, and goats. A bent metal gate is currently blocking the area where the fence was destroyed, but the
gate is not supported by posts. There are gaps on either side of the metal gate that animals could enter or escape.

Failure to maintain enclosures in good repair can lead to animal injuries and escapes. The above items must be repaired

Facilities, general.
Bags of feed are being stored on the floor of the storage shed. Two agoutis are also housed inside the food storage shed.
There was spilled feed, shavings, dirt, and debris on the floor. There are rodent droppings along the walls, chewed
styrofoam insulation, and a waste bucket attracting flies in this shed. Food and bedding must be stored in facilities that
adequately protects supplies from deterioration, molding contamination by vermin to protect the health of the animals.
Storing stacked food off the floor can help prevent moisture and molding of the feed. Keeping food off the floor and away
from walls can help with cleaning underneath and around food supplies. Covering insulation on walls with plywood,

glassboard, or metal siding can help prevent rodents from entering through the walls. Licensee must ensure that food
supplies are stored properly and that supplies are adequately protected from rodents. Correct by October 3, 2020.

1) Maturing pokeweed was growing in all three hoofstock enclosures especially along fences, in pastures, and around
wood piles. Pokeweed was growing around and in a large pile of lumber and wooden fence posts in the alpaca, llama,
horse, sheep, goat, pig enclosure. All parts of common pokeweed are toxic to humans, pets, and hoofstock.

Handling of animals.

There are two coatis housed in wire enclosures inside the red barn on opposite sides of the building. Tours with 10 to 15
adults and small children are allowed to enter barn to see the fennec foxes and coatis. There is no barrier to prevent the
public from walking up to the wire enclosures and coming in contact with the coatis. The coatis could easily bite and
scratch members of the pubic. Sufficient distance and/or barriers between the coatis and the public must be established
to minimize the risk of harm to the animals and the public. Correct by September 25, 2020.
