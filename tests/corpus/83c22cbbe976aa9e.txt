2.40(a)(2) Critical Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
In mid-October a rabbit was found dead and a necropsy was done revealing the possible cause of death was an upper
respiratory infection. At this time the facility observed 6 out of 72 rabbits were sneezing and had nasal discharge. The
facility contacted their attending veterinarian and were approved to treat with an over-the-counter antibiotic added to the
water. However, the facility added the antibiotic to the feed, which is not the correct way to deliver this antibiotic and their
attending veterinarian didn’t authorize it. All 6 rabbits displaying upper respiratory symptoms died. The licensee failed to
follow the attending veterinarian’s treatment plan. It is the responsibility of the licensee to ensure that all animals at the
facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian.

Date to be Corrected: Correct from this day forward

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
