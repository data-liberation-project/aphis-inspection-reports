One white thin female goat (recently weaned kid) was noted putting less weight on her right front foot than her left
front when standing. In addition, the right front hooves were angled inwards toward the left front hooves. She was
noted eating and moving about the goat enclosure however she was exhibits a weightbearing limp on the right front
leg when walking. The owners reported they had not noticed the limping yesterday. The goat needs to be evaluated
by a veterinarian to ensure an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan is instituted for the limping. Correct by July
13, 2017.
