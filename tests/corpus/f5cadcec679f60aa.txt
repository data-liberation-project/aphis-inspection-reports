at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not
considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The
effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated could be drastically
changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that all medications used have not gone past
the recorded expiration date. Correct by 11/4/14.
