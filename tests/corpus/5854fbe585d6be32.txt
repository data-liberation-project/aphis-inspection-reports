***Animal Room: There is a hole in the right wall that appears to have been chewed by an animal. The walls have
areas in which various layers of the wall is exposed. The surfaces of the walls are damaged and doesn't allow for
the surface to be cleaned and sanitized properly. The surfaces in the animal room are not in good repair and can
potentially expose the animals to disease. The walls need to be repaired and sealed to facilitate prescribed
husbandry practices. Correct by May 15, 2015
