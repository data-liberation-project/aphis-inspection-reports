ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:00 on
07-DEC-17.
Knocked on door, honked horn, called, waited 30 minutes. Went by place of work and his workers told me he was
out doing the harvest of pecans.
