PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The 2nd generation kennels located between the house and the office have concrete floors with multiple patches of
~1x1 ft where the concrete has delaminated and there is no longer a smooth impervious surface. The damaged
areas of the floors result in an uneven surface that can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. The
surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized and maintained on a regular basis.
