2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
Upon arriving at facility address to conduct a routine inspection, it was discovered that the licensee's facility was
completely vacant and the store sign had been removed. A check of the facility facebook page showed they had decided
not to renew their building lease and moved out of the facility in July 2022. Licensees must notify Animal Care at least 90
days in advance of any substantial changes to their operation, including a change in location or address. The licensee
needs to contact Animal Care to report their status and update their plans regarding their USDA license.
Correct by 1 September 2022

No exit interview was conducted because licensee was not available and did not return phone call.
