INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The approved protocol corresponding to the dog with post-operative dehiscence states "to list specific animal
procedures that an individual will perform as described in this Animal Care Use Protocol (ACUP) (e.g., anesthesia,
clinical observations, euthanasia, etc.).(cid:29)" For the eight individuals listed on this protocol, it states that they have
been approved to perform "(cid:28)Animal procedures (e.g. body weights, dose administration, necropsy)(cid:29)". There is no
mention that the individuals/animal care personnel will anesthetize or suture surgical sites on animals being used
under this protocol.
Although there are facility training records available for individuals listed on this protocol, there is no indication the
animal technician involved in the re-suturing of the above animal was trained in techniques to suture surgical sites
of large animals.
Failure to ensure the oversight of proper training and qualifications of personnel involved in protocols or surgical
emergencies may negatively impact the health and well-being of the animals.
It shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal
technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their
duties. This responsibility shall be fulfilled in part through the provision of training and instruction to those personnel.
Training and instruction shall be made available, and the qualifications of personnel reviewed, with sufficient
frequency to fulfill the research facility's responsibilities under this section and Sec. 2.31.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Review of facility records for a dog which was euthanized due to complications resulting from postoperative
dehiscence indicate that it did not receive adequate peri-operative and post-operative care.The IACUC approved protocol addresses pre-operative, peri-operative and post-operative analgesics as well as
post-operative antibiotics.
The anesthesia / surgery records are incomplete. Contrary to the approved protocol, there was no documentation
indicating the administration of analgesia and antibiotics post-operatively, for the initial surgery or for the surgical
site re-suturing procedure performed two days later.
In addition, re-suturing of the surgical site was performed by a technician that may not have been qualified to do so.
The records documenting suturing training for this individual were not filled out.
Failure to provide animals with adequate peri-operative and post-operative veterinary care may cause unnecessary
pain and distress to the animal.
Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the availability
of adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care in accordance with current established veterinary medical and
nursing procedures.

MISCELLANEOUS.
In a study area, 6 covered animals, held in separate plastic kennels, were stacked 3 crates high for individually
feeding animals. This placement of the containers was not secure as the containers could be knocked over,
resulting in animals getting injured.
Failure to handle all animals in a careful and safe manner may adversely affect their health and well-being. A
system should be in place to ensure all animals are handled as carefully as possible.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being of nonhuman primates plan on file primarily
addresses enrichment items provided to the animals. In addition to these items, the plan is required to address the
following elements: social grouping, special considerations, restraint devices and exemptions.
Environment enhancement should be provided to promote the psychological well-being of non-human primates,
with primates being single-housed receiving special attention.
The research facility must update their plan for environment enhancement, and at a minimum, must address each ofthe following: Social grouping, environmental enrichment, special considerations, restraint devices, and
exemptions.The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in
appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.
