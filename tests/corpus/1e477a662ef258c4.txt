FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
***On the north side of an enclosure housing a lion, there was a portion along the bottom of the enclosure,
approximately 2 ft in length, where the wire fence was not securely attached to the ground with any support system.
There was an approximately 1 1/4 inch space between the bottom of the fence and the ground. This unsecured
section of fencing may not allow for the safe containment of the animals and could increase the risk of injury to the
animals. Also, the licensee must ensure that all housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals at all times.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(d) Perimeter fence.
***The perimeter fence measured less than 8 feet (96 inches) high on the east side of the facility which houses large
felines and wolves. The licensee had put up high tensile wire along the top of the perimeter fence to add height
since the fence was included on the 9/16/14 inspection report for insufficient height. However, on the east side of
the facility, the fence measured 90 to 95 inches in height depending on the region of fence measured. The
perimeter fence must be of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The licensee must
ensure that the perimeter fence is at least 8 feet high in order to protect the type of animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facilitly at all times.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted by Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO) and Stephanie Osborne (ACI) with the
licensee.Additional Inspectors
