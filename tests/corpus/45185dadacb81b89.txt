Sanitation.
During the course of the inspection, an overall lack of sanitation was witnessed. Excreta and hair were observed collected
and caught through the wire floors of multiple cages, and a dried brown mushy substance which had the appearance of
dried fecal material was present on the tops of a many of the nesting structures inside the cages which are round capped
pieces of pvc pipe, approximately 4-5 inches round. Pests and rodents were present and feeding off of the excreta and
food waste in two of the rooms. Inadequate sanitation poses a direct health and safety hazard to the animals. Animals
that are subjected to soiled enclosures and food can become destressed, or sick. All enclosures and rooms must be
adequately cleaned and sanitized and a proper sanitation program must be maintained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
