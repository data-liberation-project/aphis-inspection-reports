2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The owner of this business has been exhibiting animals to the public for the past year without a USDA license,
which included an exhibition at a pet store in Indiana on August 30, 2016.
All exhibitors of mammals are required to be licensed by the USDA/APHIS/AC in order to provide proper care and
management of the regulated animals under the AWA.
The owner of this business must apply and obtain a USDA exhibitor license in order to exhibit mammals to the
general public. Animals may not be exhibited until a license is obtained.
The business owner did contact the regional office for an application packet to begin the process.
To be corrected by: Immediately
Inspection and exit interview conducted with business owner.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on September 6, 2016.
