FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The food storage areas need to be addressed. There is excess hay and bedding on the floor and non food items
stored on top of hay and food. Since the facility is having a rodent problem, extra steps should be taken to keep the
areas cleaned and uncluttered to reduce living areas for the pests and to adequately protect the supplies from
contamination.
