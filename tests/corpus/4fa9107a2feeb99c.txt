OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 2 dog houses in the outdoor area that houses 3 Great Danes, that do not have floors in them. While there
is some bedding, the houses are sitting on the dirt which is damp to the touch. The temperature on this date and for
the next several days is 28 Degrees F and below. The dirt floor is too cold for the regulated animals.
There is a shade panel that extends approximately 3-4 ft over the fence and is approximately 4-5 ft long. This shad
is the only shade provided for 3 full grown Great Danes. This amount of shade is not large enough to provide
adequate shelter from the elements or shade for all 3 dogs to fit comfortably at the same time.
It is important for there to be flooring in the outside dog houses in order to keep the dogs off of the cold or wet
ground, with enough bedding to provide warmth in temperatures under 35 Degrees F in order to prevent the
regulated animals from exposure to cold and/or wet condition that can be a potential for health issues.
There must be another source of shade in the outdoor areas that all dogs can lay down fully in comfortably without
being exposed to the sun or rain.
The licensee must provide a floor in the outdoor houses to get the dogs off of the ground, and extra bedding for the
cold temperatures under 35 Deg. F. There must also be additional shade provided to allow for all 3 Great Danes to
get protection from the sun, rain or snow.
To be Corrected by: December 11, 2016 for the flooring
January 8, 2017 for the additional shade
