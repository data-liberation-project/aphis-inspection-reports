that may have resulted in this discrepancy. Current numbers are being kept by several members of the IACUC and
they are currently exploring multiple options for future back-up systems to ensure that numbers are checked and
remain accurate. Numbers of animals must be accurately kept and reported on the annual report in order to ensure
proper regulatory oversight by and communication with USDA. Correct by ensuring that numbers of animals used in
