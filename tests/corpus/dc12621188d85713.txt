CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Inspectors observed the small non-human primate food preparation and storage areas to be in need of de-cluttering
and cleaning. There was an abundance of discarded materials, and empty containers on the countertops, under the
desk, and stacked on the floor. Also, the refrigerator was cluttered and in need of cleaning. Facilities must be kept
clean and clutter free in order to facilitate adequate husbandry and cleaning practices, and reduce or eliminate
breeding grounds for rodents, pests and vermin. The facility must clean and organize the aforementioned areas,
and develop a program to ensure that all areas remain clean and clutter free at all times.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inspectors observed several enclosures in need of repair in the small carnivore and bear tunnel exhibit areas. The
shift doors between the indoor and outdoor portion of the enclosures containing two ocelots, one red fox, and one
white nosed coati were rusty. Also, the concrete was chipped and pitted around the shift doors in the enclosures
containing four bush dogs, and two spotted-necked otters. Finally, the gunite rock structures near the front of the
outdoor portion of two enclosures containing one sloth bear and one sun bear were chipped and cracked. Facilities
must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair in order to securely contain the animals and protect them
from injury. The aforementioned areas must be repaired or replaced, and the facility must develop and implement a
continual maintenance program to address areas in need of repair.
