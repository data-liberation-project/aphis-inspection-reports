3.75(a) CRITICAL
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four chimps escaped from their enclosure on February 14, 2017. An animal keeper observed the chimps out of
their enclosure and followed the emergency procedures to notify the staff and clear out the compound immediately.
The facility representative stated the chimps did not venture far from their housing area and were safely returned to
their enclosure without incidence to the animals or facility personnel.
The facility’s investigation of the incident revealed the primary and secondary locks to the chimp’s primary enclosure
were broken. The facility representative stated the chimps had access to the locks and were able to manipulate and
break them.
Enclosure locks, chains, and other devices/ mechanisms must adequately and securely contain the animals and be
maintained to minimize the risk of harm to animals or persons.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and contain the animals. A
system should be in place to ensure locks used to secure animal enclosures are constructed of materials and
strength appropriate for the age and species of animal.

The facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation and implementing corrective
actions to prevent future occurrences.
This incident was self-reported and has been corrected by the facility

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
