3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several enclosures throughout the facility that are not structurally sound.
Multiple enclosures throughout the facility have large gaps between adjoining walls and/or the front gates and
adjacent walls that are large enough for the dogs to stick their heads and/or bodies through. There are at least ten
dogs housed in these enclosures.
In one enclosure, one dog was able to climb out of its enclosure and up onto the wire top covering the adjacent
pens. The animal was observed walking in the small enclosed area between the drainage panel for the top set of
enclosures and the wire tops of the bottom set of enclosures. The animal was captured and placed in a different pen
during the inspection.
Two enclosures have large holes in the front of the enclosures where food receptacles have been removed and are
large enough for the dogs to stick their entire heads through. The inspectors observed one enclosure where two
dogs were able to stick their entire heads through the hole at the same time. There are at least four dogs housed in
these enclosures.
At least two enclosures have partitions between adjacent enclosures that have become detached from the back wall
and are falling down into the enclosure. There are at least four dogs housed in these enclosures.
Failure to maintain structurally sound enclosures can lead to animal injury or escape. Housing facilities for dogs
must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. The licensee must repair or alter the affected
enclosures in a manner that keeps them safe for the dogs and structurally sound. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures are kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely and restrict other
animals from entering.

3.1(b)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a large amount of clutter, dirt, dust, debris, old food and animal waste, and scattered husbandry items
present throughout the indoor portion of the sheltered housing facility. The grooming table, the area surrounding the
unopened bags of dog food and all of the cabinets in the entryway to the kennel are excessively cluttered and dirty.
Some of the items present in these areas are scattered husbandry items (old soiled carpet/mats, drill bits, plastic
bottles, dirty towels, used syringes and needles, empty syringe cases, tools, loose light bulbs, etc). There is a thick
layer of excessive dust, dirt, and/or debris covering some of the clutter, the top of the grooming table, the shelves in
the cabinets housing the medications and cleaning supplies, and the floor under and around the unopened bags of
dog food.
Within the portion of the facility housing the dogs, there is excessive dust, dirt, debris, old food and animal waste,
hair and cobwebs throughout the floor under the raised pens, on outlets throughout the building, on the ceiling fan
and on clutter/unused husbandry items at the back of the kennel. Some of the cluttered items include unused pens
and other husbandry items. Some of the excessive dust, dirt, debris and cobwebs is very thick and is in direct
contact with the animal enclosures. There are at least forty-five adult dogs and twelve puppies housed in this facility.
Failure to keep housing facilities neat, clean and free of clutter can pose an injury hazard to the animals and can
harbor vermin and other pests. The licensee must clean these areas and properly store all the cluttered items. The
licensee must ensure that all housing facilities and areas used for storing animal food or husbandry items are kept
neat and free of any accumulation of clutter, stored materials, or any other unused items.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two enclosures, housing at least two dogs, with severely chewed and/or worn and soiled wooden resting
platforms laying on the floor of the enclosure. The chewed and worn areas are uneven and porous and the wood
has turned dark from the build-up of dirt and/or grime. There is one enclosure, housing one dog, that has a severely
chewed and/or worn whelping box. The chewed areas are uneven and have a buildup of dirt on them.
Severely chewed and/or worn surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards
for the dogs. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized must be repaired or replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must repair, replace or alter
the wooden platforms and whelping box in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization. The licensee
must ensure that all surfaces in housing facilities are kept in good repair.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Within the indoor portion of the sheltered housing facility, the inspectors noticed a strong animal waste odor and an
increase in the ammonia level. One inspector felt a burning sensation in her eyes and the other inspector felt a
burning sensation in her throat. The licensee stated that the fan within the housing facility doesn't run as often in the
winter time. A buildup of ammonia levels could have a negative effect on the health of the dogs. There are at least
forty-five adult dogs and twelve puppies housed in this building.
The enclosed or sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities for dogs must be sufficiently ventilated when dogs are
present to provide for their health and well-being, and to minimize odors and ammonia levels. The licensee must
ensure that the facility is always adequately ventilated by the use of windows, vents, fans or air conditioners to
reduce the buildup of ammonia and odors and to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.

3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Nearly all of the enclosures have sharp points and/or edges present within the enclosures. There are at least thirty
dogs housed in these enclosures.
The majority of the enclosures have broken wires and/or sharp points protruding into the enclosure from the wire
mesh walls and/or front gates of the enclosure. Some of the sharp points are the result of broken wires and some of
the sharp points are created by the unfinished edge of the wire mesh panel with sharp points running along the
entire edge of the panel.
Within the majority of the indoor runs, there are sharp points from screw tips protruding into the enclosure. The
screws run along the back side of the partitions that separate the enclosures. The screws connect the partitions to a
brace coming from the back wall, however the screws have been screwed all the way through the wall and the tips
are showing. The tips are sharp and can come in to contact with the dogs.
In one enclosure, housing one dog, there is a small sheet of metal attached to the inside front of the enclosure just
under the waterer. The edges and corner of the metal are sharp and can come into direct contact with the dog.
Sharp points and edges present an injury hazard to the animals. The licensee must remove all sharp points and
edges or alter them in a manner that keeps the affected enclosures safe for the dogs. The licensee must ensure
that all primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could
injure the dogs. Correction date: January 13, 2016
