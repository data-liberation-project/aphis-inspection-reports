2.132(d)
PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
-On the APHIS form 7020 dated 6-15-16, three skunks were acquired from a person who does not hold a current
license.
-No exhibitor shall knowingly obtain any animal from any person who is required to be licensed but does not hold a
current, valid and unsuspended license. Licensing ensures that animals are obtained from a legal source and that
the animals are provided humane care and treatment. By knowingly obtaining the animals from an unlicensed
source, the licensee and Animal Care cannot be certain these animals were legally acquired and provided humane
care and treatment. Steps must be taken to ensure all future acquisition meet this requirement, and this
noncompliant item does not repeat.
