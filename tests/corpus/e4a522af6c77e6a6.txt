3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the wooden nesting/resting boxes in the outdoor portion of the capuchin enclosure has developed an
irregularly edged hole in one corner of the piece of wood forming the floor of the box. The hole is large enough that
a capuchin could potentially injure itself or get splinters if it were to get a leg or arm caught in the opening. All
surfaces of housing facilities including boxes and furniture type fixtures must be be repaired or replaced when
necessary to provide for the safe activity of nonhuman primates. Correct by 5/1/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
