3.75(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
The two capuchin enclosures each had one elevated wooden platform which was unsealed and worn with cracks and
rough, ridges on the top surfaces. Surfaces which cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized such as unsealed, raw wood
are porous and can trap debris, bacteria, or other harmful organisms. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis.
Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled.

Housing facilities, general.
There was an open bag of primate diet on a shelf in a food storage area. Supplies of food stored open and exposed do
not protect the food from spoilage, contamination, or vermin. All food must be stored in a manner that prevents
contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. Open food supplies must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly
fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination.

Corrected at time of inspection.


3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The wooden den box in the enclosure housing female tiger “Rajalla” had an approximately 10inch by 12inch open hole
with splintered and worn wooden edges on the top surface. The tiger does have climbing access to the top of this den
box.

An elevated wooden platform along a front corner of this same enclosure was excessively worn with an approximately
2inch by 4 inch hole in one area and several splintering, jagged and loose pieces of wood and at least 3 exposed screw
heads.
Structures within an enclosure which are in disrepair such as worn, loose, jagged wood or open holes/gaps may pose an
injury risk to the animals. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury. A system of facility repair and maintenance must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of
the animals.

3.127(d) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
In July 2021 two fallow deer were killed by predators at this facility. The licensee stated that two large domestic dogs
were able to climb over the 6ft chain-link perimeter fence and then climb over the 6 ft wire enclosure fencing which
housed the fallow deer herd. One deer was found dead inside the enclosure and another was severely injured and
immediately euthanized. No other animals were injured during the attack. There were no identifiable holes, gaps, or
openings in this 6ft chain-link perimeter fence at time of this inspection.



Animals which are not protected by an effective perimeter fence may be killed, injured, or seriously harmed by contact
with wildlife, unauthorized persons, or stray animals. Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by an effective
perimeter fence that is of sufficient height and protects the animals within the facility by restricting contact and keeping
animals and unauthorized persons out. The perimeter fence must also function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility.
