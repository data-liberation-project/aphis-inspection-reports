2.77(b)

Records: Carriers and intermediate handlers.
The registrant did not produce any health certificates for dogs that she has transported. Health certificates are necessary
to ensure that the dogs have been examined by a veterinarian to determine that they are free of any infectious disease or
physical abnormality which could endanger the animal, other animals, or humans. The registrant is required to keep and
maintain a copy of health certificates for each dog or cat that she transports and to make the health certificates available
to the inspector upon request.

2.40(b)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
**A 10-week-old Shih Poo puppy (no ID) was found dead on a trash can in a holding facility. The registrant stated that the
puppy was found dead that morning after a 10 day illness of lethargy, nasal discharge, and hacking cough. The registrant
stated that the puppy had been sick when she received it 10 days earlier. She said she had a veterinarian exam the
puppy that day and he recommended treatment with the oral antibiotic doxycycline and nebulization with albuterol. The
registrant had no medical record. The bottle of medication simply said doxycycline 100mg; 50 count. There were no
instructions for this specific puppy. Further veterinary care was not sought despite the puppy's worsening condition.


Inadequately treated medical conditions can worsen, can be painful, and may be contagious to other dogs in the kennel.
The registrant must have sick or injured dogs evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis, must follow the
veterinarian's treatment plan, and must follow-up with the veterinarian if the problem does not resolve in a timely manner.

**Four dogs had excessive matting of the haircoat. A female Cockapoo (#21-32) had a large amount of dried feces matted
into the haircoat below her tail and down her back legs. A Maltese (no ID) had matted hair along its back. A poodle (no
ID) had matted hair on its back. A ShihTzu (no ID) had matted hair on its ears. Matted hair can result in skin and/or eye
problems, can be painful, and can compromise the hair’s ability to provide protection from the heat or cold. The
registrant must remove the matted hair from this animal and must establish an effective program of haircoat maintenance.

3.6(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Seven puppies in a total of 4 enclosures in the holding facilities did not have adequate head space; some of the puppies'
heads were touching the top of the enclosure. Adequate head space is necessary to provide enough room for the dogs
to comfortably make natural postural movements. The registrant must ensure that the interior height of a primary
enclosure is at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing
position.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
