3.6(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Trapped between the wire at the back of around 10% of the cages and the wall they are mounted to is a build up of
excreta, hair, and rust stains. This buildup on the surface does not allow the wall to be readily cleaned or sanitized.
The licensee has put in new caging in the last year, but the underlying wall is still accumulating buildup at this time.
Additionally, three whelping boxes show areas of excessive chew damage around the doors.
These surfaces are not able to be readily cleaned and sanitized because of the buildup, and thus can harbor
disease agents that can cause illness in the dogs. The specified areas above must be repaired and cleaned
appropriately to ensure optimal animal health.
