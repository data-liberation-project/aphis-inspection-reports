3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several surfaces of the non-human primate housing facilities are no longer able to be cleaned and sanitized readily
and need to be repaired or replaced. This includes rusty resting boards and climbing trees and branches with algae
growing on them in the outside portion of the housing enclosures. Other surfaces need to be refinished or repainted
to ensure that these surfaces can be maintained in a way that allows routine cleaning and sanitization. Surfaces
must be maintained and easily cleanable and sanitizable to limit odors and prevent disease transmission. All
surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis or must be replaced when worn or soiled.
