FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** All of the serval and caracal enclosures had platform tops that were made of pressed wood. The pressed wood is
splintered and deteriorating. It is no longer in good repair and could potentially injure the animals if it is not replaced
and/or repaired. Correct by February 16, 2016
** The 2nd pen containing a male caracal lynx had a plastic mesh fencing on the bottom portion of the chain linked
enclosure. It was unraveling in the corner and the cat could potentially get entangled in it. The enclosure should be
in good repair and the mesh fencing should be repaired and/or replaced. Correct by February 16, 2016.

SANITATION.
** In the new kinkajou cage that contained 2 kinkajous there was an abundance of feces on the floor. There was a
foul odor and the presence of several flying insects. Feces shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to
reduce odors. When enclosures are cleaned by hosing or flushing, adequate measures shall be taken to protect the
animals confined in such enclosures from being directly sprayed with the stream of water or wetted involuntarily.
