ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two adult fawn colored female pugs that have abnormal eye conditions. 'Shania' also identified by
microchip (4531326107) is thought to be blind or partially blind according to the licensee. There is a black and dried
crusty matter covering approximately 70 percent of the surface of the dog's right eye. The left eye has an abnormal
blue-grey spot in the center and is also heavily matted with greenish colored mucus. Both eyes have a protruding
"bubble-like" bulge in the center of the eye.
'Angie' also identified by microchip (051-340-788) has a build-up of greenish colored mucus on the surface of its
right eye. The interior portion of the left eye is cloudy and has a blue-grey color.
Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, trauma, etc and can be painful. The
animals must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administered. Documentation
should be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must be part of this
documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
Within the indoor housing facility there is dirt, hair and food waste on the floor and hair caught on the wire fronts of
the enclosures affecting 14 dogs. This can contribute to pest, odors, and disease hazards. Inside of the building is in
need of a general cleaning and sanitizing to remove dirt, grime, excreta, food waste, hair, etc. from between and
behind the enclosures, from the fronts of the enclosures, the floors and walls. All surfaces of housing facilities must
be cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis to reduce odors, pest, disease hazards, and to contribute to the health
and well-being of the animals.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is an enclosure containing an adult female basset hound in the outdoor housing area. The shelter in this
enclosure does not have a wind and rain break. Lack of wind and rain breaks does not provide protection from the
elements. The licensee must ensure all shelters being used be provided with a wind and rain break.
