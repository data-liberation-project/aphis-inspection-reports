Facilities, indoor.
There are two areas of the linoleum floor that are damaged with bare wood present. Indoor guinea pig facilities must be
maintained so that the surfaces are impervious to moisture so that can be readily sanitized when dirty. The floor with the
bare wood showing must be repaired, replaced, or resealed so that the floor surfaces are impervious to moisture.

This is a 1st re-license inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within two more inspection(s) within 60 days of today (2/4/2023), or the applicant will
forfeit the license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next re-license
inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
