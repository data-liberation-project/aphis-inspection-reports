FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The jacob sheep shelter had boards missing on either side of the door. One of the sheep was observed sticking
his head through the gaps. This could possibly lead to injury of the animals. All animal enclosures must be kept in
good repair.

2. The fencing for the camel enclosure was sagging and bent. The top part of the fence was not attached to the
horizontal posts, allowing the fencing to sag in parts. This situation significantly decreased the total height of the
fence. This could possibly lead to injury and potentially allow entry of unwanted animals. All animal enclosures
must be kept in good repair.

3. The fencing for the goat pens had portions which had become detached from the wall of the wolf shed. The extra
fencing which was not attached was loosely laying on the ground. This created a gap where the goats could
potentially escape from the enclosure, and possibly become injured. All animal enclosures must be kept in goodrepair.

PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
The red livestock trailer used to transport animals had two small areas that had rusted out. This condition was now
causing gaps to form between the floor and the wall and approximately 18 inches directly above on the drivers side
of the trailer. This condition could possibly affect the safety of the animals being transported within. This trailer
needs to be repaired.
