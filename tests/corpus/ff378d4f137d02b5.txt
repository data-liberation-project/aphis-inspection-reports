CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an empty enclosure next to two other enclosures housing seven dogs that had overgrown weeds. Weeds
must be controlled to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control and to protect the health and well-being of
the animals. The licensee stated that the weeds would be pulled by June 29, 2016.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
