2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee stated (twice) that he performed a descenting procedure at approximately 5 weeks of age on 29
juvenile skunks without the veterinarian present. The licensee had paperwork of descenting procedures approved
by the attending veterinarian. The procedure document did not provide an age at which the procedure was to
occur. A precise age of the animals was unknown due to lack of records of the offspring born on the property. The
inspector contacted the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was not aware that the licensee was
performing the procedure at the age of approximately 5 weeks, and would want to witness the procedure at that age
before guidance and approval would be given. The attending veterinarian stated they witnessed the licensee doing
the procedure on 5 skunks that were 2 weeks of age, and was comfortable with the licensee preforming the
procedure on future animals at the same age without the veterinarian being present. The licensee did not follow the
exact procedure that was approved by the veterinarian in respect to the age of the animals.
Not following the directions of the attending veterinarian does not ensure adequate veterinary care. The licensee
shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary
care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
To be corrected by: This day forward.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records of the animals held, owned, leased, or possessed did not include the offspring born of any animal while
in the licensee’s possession or under their control, or the acquisition date (birthdate). The licensee stated that they
gave all the skunk offspring of 2018 the birthdate of May 5, 2018, but it was not recorded anywhere.
Lack of records does not allow for adequate veterinary care that is based on age, identifying that the licensee is only
selling offspring from animals born and raised on their property, and identifying that all animals are accounted for
and no escapes have occurred. The records shall include all regulated animals acquired, owned, held, leased orotherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by the dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession
or under his or her control.
