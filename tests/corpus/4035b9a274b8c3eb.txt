2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A gray fox named (cid:28)Zoe(cid:29) was observed to have a problem with her right eye. When she blinked, she was unable to
close her lids over the eyeball of the right eye, and instead the third eyelid came across the eye, as opposed to the
left eye, which blinked normally. This presentation suggests the possibility of an enlarged eyeball, an injury, or a
disease issue, and could be painful to the animal. The condition had been noticed by staff, and an annual exam
had already been scheduled for a few days later, but the staff did not recognize the possibility that this condition
could be painful and / or have serious medical consequences for the animal.
The Program of Veterinary Care should include daily observation by staff, and appropriate, prompt communication
with the attending veterinarian, or his or her alternate if not available, in the event that any health problems are
noted. Failure to consult with a veterinarian could result in suffering and / or a poor medical outcome for the
animals.
To be corrected immediately.
An exit interview was conducted at the time of inspection.
