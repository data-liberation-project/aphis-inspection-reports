Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Yorkshire terrier (#3961) has poor dental health. A buildup of dark colored tartar is located on the surface of both
upper canine teeth as well as the upper and lower cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth. Two of the upper cheek teeth
on the left side of the mouth are loose and move easily when gentle pressure is applied by the inspector. Several small
holes or gaps are located at the base of the loose teeth as well as the along the base of one upper cheek tooth on the
right side of the mouth. A grey material is also found along the gum line of the loose teeth and around the lower left
cheek teeth. The gums are moderately reddened and have receded away from the teeth. This dog was documented on
the previous inspection report for poor dental health. The Attending Veterinarian examined the dog but did not treat the
animal, instead he approved the licensee to hand scale the dog's teeth. The scaling of the dog's teeth has not improved
the animal's dental health and the condition appears to have worsened as a tooth is now loose and holes have formed at
the base of the teeth.

Female grey mixed breed dog (#2842) has poor dental health. The upper left canine tooth is loose and moves easily
when gentle pressure is applied by the inspector. At least half the surface of the tooth also has a buildup of dark brown
colored tartar. The dog has very few teeth remaining in its mouth. This dog was cited on the previous inspection report
for poor dental health. The Attending Veterinarian examined the dog but did not treat the animal, instead he approved the

licensee to hand scale the dog's teeth. The scaling of the dog's teeth has not improved the animal's dental health and the
condition appears to have worsened as a tooth is now loose.

Male Yorkshire terrier (#9067) has poor dental health. Nearly the entire surface of the upper left and right canine teeth
and front teeth have a buildup of dark brown colored tartar. A hole has formed at the base of one of the upper right cheek
teeth and along the base of an upper left cheek tooth. A small amount of blood is located along the gum line of one of the
lower left cheek teeth. The upper and lower cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth are coated in a creamy white
substance and the gums are slightly reddened. This dog was cited on the previous inspection report for poor dental
health (the dog was incorrectly given ID #4067 on previous report). The Attending Veterinarian examined the dog but did
not treat the animal, instead he approved the licensee to hand scale the dog's teeth. The scaling of the dog's teeth has
not improved the animal's dental health and the condition appears to have worsened as blood is located in the mouth and
holes have formed at the base of the teeth.

Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and if not properly treated, the condition could worsen
resulting in a detrimental impact on the animal's health and well-being.

Female Yorkshire terrier (#4073) has an abnormal condition of the left eye. An area of raised reddened tissue is located
in the inside corner of the eye. A clear discharge is located on the hair and eyelids around the affected tissue. Areas of
hair loss are located above and in front of the eye. The licensee was not aware of the dog's condition and the animal has
not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and has not received any treatment.

Abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the animal.


Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Approximately 10 adult dogs have no documented acquisition information. The licensee uses APHIS form 7005 (Record
of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand) to record all required acquisition information for the dogs, but at least 10 dogs
are not documented on the form. Failure to document acquisition information interferes in the ability of APHIS officials to
identify dogs and trace their movements.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose all required information for each
dog acquired, owned, held, or otherwise possessed, euthanized, sold or otherwise disposed of. The licensee must add
the acquisition information of the missing dogs to APHIS form 7005. The licensee must ensure all required documents
are complete and contain accurate information at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
The fronts of the dog enclosures are constructed of coated wire. An opening is cut in the wire to accommodate a self
feeder, but the facility no longer has feeders placed in these openings. In one enclosure, containing one dog, the opening
has not been blocked and is large enough for the dog to place its head or leg through. Openings in the enclosure that are

large enough for a dog to place its head or leg through could cause injury to the animal should it become entrapped.

Housing facilities must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The licensee must alter the opening in
a manner that eliminates the potential of the dog to place its head or other body parts through. The licensee must ensure
that the enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.

In one enclosure, containing one adult dog, the access door is framed in metal. A strip of the metal has become
unattached from the wall and is bent towards the interior of the enclosure. The bent metal is creating a sharp edge which
could cause injury to the dog should it come into contact with it.

Housing facilities must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The licensee must alter the bent metal
framing in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the dog. The licensee must ensure that the enclosures are safe
for the dogs at all times.

3.1(c)(2) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
Two enclosures, containing a total of one adult and two puppies, have carpet squares in the whelping boxes. The edges
of the carpet squares have been excessively torn and shredded into long strings. The inspector observed one 12-week
old puppy continually entangle its legs in the strings as it ran around the carpet square. The damaged and shredded

carpet cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized which could increase the risk of disease and the animals could also
become entangled in the damaged carpets resulting in injury.

All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must alter the damaged carpet squares in a manner that
allows for proper cleaning and sanitizing of the surface and eliminates any risk of injury. The licensee must ensure that all
surfaces of housing facilities are kept in good repair and can be readily cleaned and sanitized at all times.
3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The interior of one whelping box, accessed by one 12 week old puppy, has a buildup of brown material. One side of the
interior of the box is completely covered in the brown material and a smaller amount of the material is located on the
interior of the adjacent side. Approximately one-third of the surface of one of the exterior sides of the box is also coated in
the brown material. Failure to maintain surfaces in a sanitary manner could increase the risk of disease towards the
dogs.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and
more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food, waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The
licensee must clean and sanitize the whelping box and ensure that the box remains free of a buildup of material at all
times.
3.13(b) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.

The licensee had the Attending Veterinarian physically examine each dog on 06/07/21, but there is no medical record
documenting the exams and the results of the exams. Failure to document the exams interferes with APHIS officials
ability to determine if the dog is receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. The licensee
must document all required information for the physical examination of each dog. The licensee must ensure medical
records are kept for each animal.

Female Maltese (#187) has an abdominal hernia diagnosed by the Attending Veterinarian. The dog received treatment
for the hernia in either the Spring or Summer of 2021. No medical record could be presented containing the information,
procedures, and treatment the dog received for the condition. Failure to create and maintain medical records interferes in
the ability of APHIS officials to ensure adequate veterinary care has been provided.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records which contain the dog's identification information and all information relating
to the diagnosis, treatment and procedures the animal receives. The licensee must ensure that all medical concerns are
fully and completely documented in a medical record that is available for APHIS inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
