2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
DIRECT: *** One black and white Jacob's ewe is limping on the right front leg and holding its right front foot off of
the ground intermittently when standing. The carpus joint on the right front leg is also swollen. This animal requires
veterinary attention to determine the underlying problem. Limping is a sign of pain in animals and requires
veterinary intervention. Failure to recognize and address veterinary problems in the animals can lead to animal
suffering and adversely affect animal health and well-being. Correct this by having this animal examined by the
attending veterinarian. All veterinary treatment recommendations must be followed and documentation maintained
by the licensee for future inspection by APHIS officials.
*** This animal must be examined by the attending veterinarian by July 4, 2014.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED
2.75(b)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** There are no records of disposition for the Suffolk sheep that have been removed from this facility. The facility
representative stated that he was told by the licensee to only say that the sheep are no longer at the facility. Lack of
records and failure to provide information on these dispositions make animal tracking difficult to impossible. There
were 50 Suffolk-type sheep on the previous inspection dated June 4, 2014 and only 3 Suffolk-type sheep on hand
today. There are 47 sheep unaccounted for, three of which were also found in need of veterinary care on the last
inspection. Failure to provide documentation of these animal movements also prohibits APHIS from being able to
track animals found in need of care. All future animal dispositions must be documented and these records
maintained for APHIS review.
**Correct from this day forward
This was a focused inspection to follow-up on animals found in need of veterinary care on the June 4, 2014inspection and to inspect all animals for appropriate veterinary care. The facility provided documentation that the
attending veterinarian examined the pygmy goats, the elk, fallow deer #0895, and Suffolk sheep #160 on June 5,
2014. Suffolk sheep #160, #305, and #310 have been removed from the facility.
