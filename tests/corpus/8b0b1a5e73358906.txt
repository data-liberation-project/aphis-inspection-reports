3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple areas both in and outside the enclosures were not cleaned properly or at appropriate frequencies.
Specifically:
*The viewing room attached to green enclosure housing two young chimpanzees had several crates/buckets of
miscellaneous items in the corner, which were not in use and covered in dust.
*The inside corner edge of the gibbon shelter had a buildup of dried, deteriorating waste material.
*In the two macaques(cid:25) enclosure, there were multiple piles of waste scattered throughout the floor. Rather than spot
cleaning daily, the licensee stated that she was hosing down the waste twice a week. The macaques seemed to
spend a great amount of time on the ground and therefore had an increased chance of coming in contact with the
waste.
*At least two of the tunnels that connect chimpanzee enclosures had trash and waste accumulating in them. The
licensee stated she is only able to clear out the debris once every two weeks.
*One corner of Joey's enclosure had a build-up of whitish-gray to brown, organic material that appeared to be
deteriorating food waste.
*In the pink room, in many areas where the bars met the walls/ceilings, there was a build-up of black grimy material
and/or organic waste material.
*The mister pipe, which ran the length of the pink room, was dark brown-black colored, apparently due to flyspeck.
There were multiple flies observed on the pipe.
** Proper and routine cleaning and sanitizing is necessary to prevent the attraction of pests and disease
transmission.*** The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact are
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.84 to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease
hazards.
Furthermore, the licensee must ensure all other surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized as often as
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
3.77(b)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
* There was a strong odor of both feces and ammonia upon entering the pink room. The licensee has an HVAC
system for that room but had not turned it on yet that day. The vents for the central air sytem were covered in
cobwebs and dust.
** Poor ventilation can attract pests such as flies and could even be harmful to the animals by allowing ammonia
levels to get too high.
*** The licensee must ensure that animal facilities are sufficiently ventilated at all times to provide for the health and
well-being of nonhuman primates and to minimize odors and ammonia levels.

3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* There were numerous cockroaches observed during the inspection on the main floor. Several groups of the
cockroaches were resting on the external beams of the green enclosure for the young chimpanzees. The licensee
stated it had been a problem for nearly a month and attempted to treat several times with a commercial spray. She
eventually sought the help of an exterminator service, which visited the property the day before the inspection. In
addition to the cockroaches, there was an excessive amount of flies seen in the back of the pink room in between
the chimpanzees' enclosures. In addition, there were multiple flies and fruit flies seen in the food storage cooler.
** Flies and cockroaches can easily transmit harmful pathogens and pose a health risk for the animals.
*** The licensee must ensure that an effective pest control program is established and maintained to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. TO BE CORRECTED BY:
13 November 2014The inspection and a thorough verbal exit interview were conducted with the licensee on 29 October 2014.
