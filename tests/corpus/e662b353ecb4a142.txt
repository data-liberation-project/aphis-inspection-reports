3.6(a)(2)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
During inspection, three dogs were observed to be running behind the fencing underneath the outdoor grates along the
back wall which is the span of approximately eleven enclosures. I suspect the three dogs slipped underneath the fencing
to get behind that fencing which is underneath the grates. The dogs are able to escape their primary enclosure and get
into an area that is unsanitary (which may contribute to the spread of disease) and from that area they could potentially
get into other enclosures which may allow them to get into an enclosure with dogs they are not compatible with. When
dogs get into this area, they could potentially be missed by the licensee during observation. They wouldn't have access to
their food or sanitary water. All of this could result in serious injury or even death to the dogs. The enclosure must be
fixed so the dogs can't get into the area behind the fencing underneath the grates.
3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The applicant informed me he never removes the excreta from the outdoor primary enclosures. Not removing the excreta
on a daily basis in unsanitary and contributes to the spread of disease. Excreta must be removed from all outdoor
enclosures on a daily basis.
3.13(b)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.

The applicant is not keeping records of dogs that go the Attending Veterinarian that are being treated for various illnesses
or issues. Dog # 14858, a female Bichon, was marked on APHIS Form 7005 as having died in January 2022. The
applicant stated he took the dog to vet to be treated for its health issue, but he does not have any records showing what
the problem was or what was done to treat the problem. Other dogs were noted in the APHIS Form 7005 as having died
or been euthanized, but the applicant stated he doesn't keep records of when they go to the Veterinarian to be treated for
an illness or injury. Not keeping proper records doesn't allow for the APHIS Inspector to be able to confirm that the
applicant is seeking Veterinarian care when his dogs are in need of Veterinarian care. Anytime a problem is identified
(such as a disease, injury, or illness), the applicant must document the date and description of the problem, examination
findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed.
3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The applicant stated his adult dogs are vaccinated for parvo and distemper, but he has no records to confirm they were
given and the dates they were administered. Not keeping records of distemper and parvo vaccines doesn't ensure that all
adult dogs have been vaccinated for these diseases. The applicant must document the names and dates of all vaccines
that have been administered to the dogs.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 11/26/22 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
