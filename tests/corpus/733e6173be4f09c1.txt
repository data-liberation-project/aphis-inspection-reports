2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The brown nosed coatimundi cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report appears much more responsive
and the owner has not observed any abnormal behavior since the last inspection. However, at the time of inspection
the animal has not been evaluated by a veterinarian experienced and knowledgeable of exotic species.
***One arctic fox appears significantly thinner than its cage mate.This animal has still not grown in a winter coat.
The combination of lower body condition at a time when the species normally gains weight and slower winter coat
development may be indicative of poor health. However, at the time of inspection the animal has not been evaluated
by a veterinarian experienced and knowledgeable of exotic species.
The coatimundi and arctic fox animal must be assessed by a veterinarian experienced with the species indicated as
soon as possible in order to receive appropriate diagnosis and treatment. NOTE: It is noted in the attending
veterinarian's report that the owner seek further evaluation of the animals from a veterinarian familiar with the
species.
3.127(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from Inclement Weather
***The guillotine gate for the bear lock off area has been open since October 13, 2016 to allow the bear unlimited
access to the den. The owner is still recovering from the injury received while handling the bear previously and
cannot lift the guillotine gate without assistance.The bear must have access to an appropriately designed den when
needed. A long term and effective method of providing the bear access to a den at all times must be established.
***The metal pipe construction of the bear den does not possess sufficient insulating properties for this tropical
species and the lack of bedding exacerbates this issue. Bedding provides a soft substrate, as well as insulation, and
is particularly important for bears because of their motivation to build nests and line dens. Failure to provide an
appropriately furnished den may result in frustration or unmotivated behavior, and an inability to behaviorally
thermoregulate. The den construction remains unchanged but the bear has been provided with straw to facilitate
nesting behavior. A more appropriate den is needed for the bear's health and comfort. NOTE: The bear isscheduled to be moved to a new facility.
***The fallow deer enclosure has a two-sided shelter that cannot adequately protect from wind or precipitation. In
addition, there are holes and sharp edges in the shelter divider.
***The mouflon shelter has only two sides, and cannot adequately protect from wind or precipitation. In addition, the
shelter has gaps and loose boards.Failure to protect animals from detrimental weather conditions can negatively
impact their health and ability to fight disease. Appropriately constructed shelters, with a minimum of 3-sides, must
be provided.
NOTE: The cougar has been moved to a new licensed facility.
