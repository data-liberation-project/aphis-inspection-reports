ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***On August 2, 2016 three (3) African Green Monkeys on study 16-054 died following a bronchial alveolar gavage
procedure. One (1) was found dead and the other two were in respiratory distress and expired after unsuccessful
attempts to revive them. The following day, August 3, 2016, five (5) additional African Green Monkeys on the study
were found dead during the morning health check. Four (4) African Green Monkeys on the study remain and have
not demonstrated any signs of illness or distress.
Post-procedural monitoring was conducted per SOP during normal work hours, however no additional monitoring of
the remaining nine (9) non-human primates on the study was conducted overnight. Due to the recent deaths of the
non-human primates on study, more frequent monitoring may have allowed for more immediate intervention to
prevent the deaths of the remaining animals on the study. Procedures must be established and implemented to
ensure adequate monitoring of study animals following an adverse event. Correct by December 30, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director / IACUC Chair.
