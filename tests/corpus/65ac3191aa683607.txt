ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility has two new primates and both of these animals are provided with environmental enrichments.
However, a written environmental enrichment plan was not in place. A written plan must be developed,
documented and followed to ensure that the non-human primates are provided with enrichments to promote their
psychological well-being.
The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate
professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.
