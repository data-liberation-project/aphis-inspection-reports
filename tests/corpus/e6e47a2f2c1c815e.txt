Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
- In barn 1, top shelf, 7th enclosure from the right, in the left row a young, white guinea pig was noticed with its right eye
closed with some clear discharge. When the guinea pig was examined closer, it did open its eye, but it appeared smaller
than the left eye and appeared hazy and blue centrally .
- In barn 2, top shelf, 7th enclosure from the left, in the right row an adult, white and orange guinea pig was noticed to
have a nickel sized, circular lesion on its right hip area. This lesion penetrated full thickness of the skin and was deeply
packed with a large amount of white, toothpaste consistency discharge. Neither of these veterinary issues had been
noted by the licensee and had not been communicated to the attending veterinarian.

Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being must be completed. Daily observation of animals
may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian. A mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

Daily observations must be made of all animals housed at the facility. The attending veterinarian must be contacted when
a veterinary issue is noticed to alleviate these painful conditions.

Watering.
Approximately 25% of the crocks used for water for the male rabbits have large cracks, or chips.

Water receptacles shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.

Water crocks with cracks or chips are not able to be properly sanitized and can harbor harmful bacteria and cause illness.
These crocks must be replaced when cracked or chipped.

3.53(c)(2)

Primary enclosures.
The licensee is keeping female rabbits with their litters in 30" by 30" enclosures. At least 5 of these litters are over the
age of 8 weeks. Most enclosures currently house females with litters, except several enclosure with a single female. At
least two of these females with litters have also been rebred.

Primary enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space for the animal to make normal
postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.

Rabbits are typically weaned between 4 and 8 weeks of age. Due to lack of space these litters are not weaned
appropriately. The licensee also does not have any additional enclosures to properly wean, and house these rabbits over
8 weeks of age. Rabbits need to be properly weaned prior to sale to avoid undue stress of these young rabbits. Proper
space must be offered these rabbits to avoid overcrowding and to offer freedom of movement to assure proper growth

and development.
