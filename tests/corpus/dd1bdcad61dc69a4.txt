FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The raccoon was given a pillow which she shredded within 1 day. The fiberfill contents of that pillow was scattered
throughout the enclosure. This loose fiberfill is not digestible and poses a potential risk of blockage or impactions in
the esophagus, stomach, or intestines if this animal should ingest it.
A carpeted cat tower was also placed inside the fox squirrel enclosure yesterday. One (or both) of these animals
also shredded the top platform leaving long stands of carpet backing jute. The actual carpet strands could not be
found in the enclosure. These pieces of material can also pose a risk of blockage or impactions if the animals
ingest it (these materials were immediately removed during the inspection).
All items that are placed within an enclosure shall be of such material & strength as appropriate for the habits &
behaviors of any particular species within that enclosure to protect the animal from injury. Develop a plan and
determine which types of materials, &/or bedding, can be used for each species of mammal to prevent the risk ofingestion and subsequent blockages or impactions. This plan shall be reviewed by all caretakers so they are
familiar as to what can (or cannot) be used in each enclosure.
