2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The small mammals have been moved to the exhibit hall of the facility for exhibiting purposes. The opossum
enclosure has only a latch and no lock on the door and could be easily accessible to the public. In addition the
hedgehog is in an open aquarium on top of a table and there is easy access to the animal. Since there is no
attendant present in the hall at all times for public exhibition, measures should be taken to prevent direct contact
with the animals for their safety.
