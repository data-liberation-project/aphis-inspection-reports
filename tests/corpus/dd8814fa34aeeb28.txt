2.30(a)(1)
REGISTRATION.
The licensee has been using the rabbits and goats at his facility for antibody production. Antigen and adjuvant is
obtained from an off-site company and injected into the animals by the licensee. These activities meet the definition
of research and require a USDA registration. There is no valid research registration in place at this location. The
requirement for a valid registration to be issued prior to conducting these activities has been explained to the
licensee on numerous occasions by this inspector. Most recently in July 2016 during a phone conversation after an
attempted inspection when the licensee stated the animals were being used for antibody production. He was told to
discontinue this type of animal use activity until a research registration was obtained.
The licensee stated that he thought a registration had since been issued in the name of the business supplying him
products. He was advised during today's inspection that a registration has not been issued to allow research
activities at his location/site. No regulated activities may be conducted until a valid USDA research registration has
been obtained. Correct by: Immediate.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care stated that the adult goats will receive CDT vaccinations annually. The
various goats at this facility were last vaccinated between March and July 2015. To ensure adequate disease
control vaccinations should be administered according to the schedule documented in the program of veterinary
care and using industry standard guidelines. Correct by: November 3, 2016.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
