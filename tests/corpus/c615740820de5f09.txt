HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The seven outdoor runs do not have protective fencing on top. This fencing is necessary for containment
purposes, because some of the dogs can climb the existing chainlink sides, thus escaping the enclosures.

*** In several areas, including the gates, the fencing enclosing the exercise area does not reach ground level. The
gaps are large enough to allow the entrance of animals from outside, and, depending on the size of the dogs within,
escape.

3.4(b)(2)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** There is no overhead protection from the sun, rain, and snow for dogs using the outdoor runs. Minimally this
oversight could be uncomfortable for the dogs, and if weather conditions were severe enough, the oversight could
lead to health problems.
