Facilities, indoor.
The temperature in the room housing the four guinea pigs was 86 degrees F as measured with a Raytek MiniTemp. The
outdoor temperature was 92 degrees F at the time of inspection. There was a combination air conditioning/dehumidifier
unit operating in the room, but it did not provide sufficient ventilation to lower the temperature. Guinea pigs housed in
high temperatures may be subject to discomfort and heat stress. Ensure guinea pigs are housed in adequately ventilated
facilities that do not allow the ambient temperature to rise above 85 degrees F.

Facilities, general.
Two animal enclosures were in disrepair during the time of inspection.
1. The fencing is in disrepair in the enclosure housing two pigs. The fence is comprised of wood posts and 2x4 inch wire.
Two areas of the 2x4 wire are broken, exposing metal points to the animals. The affected areas of the fence are located
adjacent to the mud wallow and adjacent to the shelter entrance/exit door. Exposed metal points could potentially injure
the animals. Ensure animals are housed in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair.
2. The roof and ground of the enclosure housing the red fox and Artic fox remain in disrepair. The roof of the enclosure is
flat and comprised of shingled 4ft x 8ft plywood. No fewer than six sections of the plywood are bending downward into the

enclosure. Each of these pieces of plywood are beginning to delaminate at the edges/seams. Additionally, there are two
plywood boards with evidence of mild water damage. The current condition of the roof is a safety hazard to the animals
as it could collapse and injure them. A portion of enclosure floor/ground is covered with 12in x 12in concrete pavers and
remains in disrepair. The licensee filled previously affected areas with concrete and gravel, however the foxes, have dug
additional holes. One hole is beginning to go approximately six inches underneath additional pavers. The holes are a
potential safety hazard as they could cause the pavers to collapse and injure the animals.
Ensure animals are housed in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair.

Sanitation.
Two enclosures contained excessive excreta
1. The enclosure housing two pigs (located on the concrete patio/yard) had excessive feces present. Most of the feces
were concentrated along the back fence in the yard and all along the elevated ledges of the concrete patio wall. The
licensee stated chickens were previously able to enter the area and were responsible for the feces on the patio wall.
2. The enclosure housing one capybara and one pig contained excessive feces and a plastic pool containing excessive
excreta. One section of the animals' shelter contained most of the excessive feces. The plastic pool, used by the
capybara, was partially filled with excreta contaminated, brown colored water.
Excessive excreta produces odors, attracts flies, and is a potential disease hazard to the animals. Remove the excreta
and thoroughly clean the affected areas of these enclosures. Repeat often enough to prevent build up.
