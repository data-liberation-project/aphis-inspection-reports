FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a wide gap of approximately 10-12 inches between the chain link gate and frame near the cougar
enclosure. The chain that secures the gate needs to be tightened and additional chains and or fastening material
needs to be used for the bottom and top of this gate. Perimeter fences must be constructed so that it protects the
animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility.
