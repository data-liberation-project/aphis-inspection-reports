FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The nursery area for the tiger cubs has electrical outlets that do not have covers exposing bare, live, electrical
wires. Also, the nursery has two single pane windows that are low enough that the cubs could potentially break and
escape through these windows. This nursery enclosure is not secure, nor is it safe for the enclosed animals. The
licensee must secure the nursery and cover the electrical wires to keep the enclosed animals safe and prevent
animals from escaping their enclosure. The licensee covered the outlets and put a metal grate over the windows
the day of the inspection.
Corrected at time of inspection.

FEEDING.
- Cardboard boxes full of meat in the walk in refrigerator were sitting on the floor and packed to the sides of the
refrigerator. These boxes of meat were thawing and contained condensate on the tops and sides making the
cardboard weak. Also, there was an open box of meat with the plastic liner also open exposing this meat to
contaminates like the condensate. This was on top of a stack of boxes which had crushed two boxes at the base,
forcing open the sides and exposing the contents to potential contamination. Open containers of meat/food must be
stored in a sealed container to keep it palatable and wholesome for the park animals. Food boxes must be stored
off the floor and protected from contaminates to maintain safe, healthy, palatable food for the park animals. The
licensee must store and maintain food in accordance with the AWA. This was corrected during the inspection.
