ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 10:30am on 07/27/2016.
The inspectors arrived along with NY Department of conservation officer as a team inspection. Upon arrival, I
knocked on the door and rang the doorbell several times. Ms Leo came to the doorway and when I said hello and
she gave me no verbal acknowledgement. I introduced Dr. Lupo and also stated we were with DEC Officer Thomas.
I told her we needed to do an inspection and she walked past me towards the garage next to the facility. As we
walked to the garage, I asked if her opossums were still housed in the garage and she stated that (cid:28)they were no
longer at the facility(cid:29). I asked "(cid:28)oh, where did they go?"(cid:29) At this point Ms. Leo stopped, turned to me and stated that
she needed to contact her lawyer before doing the inspection. I said ok and she left us to go into the house. We
then stayed by the garage and waited for her.
Several minutes later she came to me and stated that, "(cid:28)you need to talk to my lawyer before I'(cid:25)ll do the inspection".
I explained to her that, "(cid:28)No, based on the conditions of her AWA exhibitor license, I did not need to talk to her
lawyer prior to an inspection." (cid:28) She again tried to hand me a business card and I asked her," (cid:28)If she was refusing
the inspection process"(cid:29). She again stated that, "(cid:28)I needed to talk to her lawyer first"(cid:29) to which I replied," (cid:28)no, and
asked her again if she was refusing the inspection process and that I needed a verbal confirmation of that"(cid:29). At this
point she dropped the business card and walked away from us. I immediately looked at Dr. Lupo and Officer
Thomas and confirmed that she had refused the inspection process. Officer Thomas picked up the business card
and proceeded to call her lawyer. The approximate time was 10:42 when Ms. Leo went into the house. Officer
Thomas spoke to the lawyer stating that Ms. Leo was violating both USDA regulations and NY state regulations by
not allowing the inspection process. He then informed Ms. Leo that we had spoken to her lawyer and for her to call
him. After several more minutes she came back out of the house and asked all of us to leave her property.
Refusal to allow APHIS officials to enter a facility in order to inspect regulated species and other potentially
regulated animals is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Access must be granted to any facilities as
deemed necessary by APHIS officials in order to enforce the provisions of the AWA regulations and standards,
including but not limited to animal housing areas, procedure areas, transportation conveyances, holding areas, or
other auxiliary areas related to the care or use of regulated species. In addition records may be examined and
copied as needed and photographs taken of the facilities and animals as APHIS officials consider necessary. Correct by allowing APHIS officials to enter and examine all facilities and animals properly.
ACI Andrea D'Ambrosio and VMO Dr Keri Lupo were present at the time of this refused inspection.
