2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care maintained by the licensee is out of date; the most recent signature on the papers
presented during the inspection was 2008. The attending veterinarian has not performed a site visit in the last
several years according to the licensee; however, the animals have all been examined by the veterinarian on a
routine basis. The attending veterinarian can provide expertise and guidance on the animals' living arrangements
and how they contribute to the animals' overall health and well-being. The licensee must establish and maintain a
program of veterinary care, to include site visits by the attending veterinarian not less than annually.

MOBILE OR TRAVELING HOUSING FACILITIES.
During the 1pm show, the inspectors observed one of the female baboons chewing on the leash that was attached
to the stool she sat on during the show. This animal could have easily chewed through her leash and be left without
any form of direct control. Additionally, for a short time during the performance, one of the capuchins had a leash
that was not in the trainer's direct control. Nonhuman primates used in traveling exhibits, trained animal acts, or in
uncaged public exhibits must be under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all
times when the pubic is present. Correct by ensuring that all nonhuman primates are are under the handlers direct
control at all times when the public is present.
Correct from this time forward.
