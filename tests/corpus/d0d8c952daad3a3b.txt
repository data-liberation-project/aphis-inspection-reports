2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female bobcat with a history of weight loss has a notation in the keeper records on 9 June 2016 that she was
“eating noticeably less in the last few days”. The keeper told inspectors that this decrease in appetite started
approximately three days before the 9th but there are no notations in the keeper records between 1 June and 9
June 2016. Records show that the attending veterinarian (AV) was consulted (while keeper was picking up
medications at his office) on this day (9 June) and he instructed the keeper staff to try offering the animal a wider
variety of food. Keeper notes show that the bobcat was offered a variety of food on 10 June 2016 but no mention of
whether the animal did eat the food offered.
There were no notations in the keeper records for 11 and 12 June 2016. The keeper record had a notation for 13
June 2016 (Monday) stating that the animal “looked like” she had eaten some food over the weekend but that no
feces were found in the enclosure over the weekend.
The notation in the keeper record for 14 June 2016 states that the bobcat had not eaten any food offered the day
before and appeared weak. The AV was not contacted again until 14 June 2016 and an appointment was
scheduled for the afternoon of the next day. There was no communication regarding this bobcat with the AV
documented before 9 June or from 10 June until 14 June 2016 depsite the deteriorating condition of the animal. The
animal was euthanized at 3pm on 15 June 2016 due to progressing weakness, not eating, and presumed kidney
failure.
Daily observation and direct, frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the health care
of the animals. The licensee must observe animals daily to asses their health and well-being and establish as part
of the program of veterinary care, a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1)(iv)RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility transported three white-tailed deer to give to a private individual on 2 June 2016 but does not have any
information documenting the name and address of the person to whom the animal was sold or given. Correct
documentation is necessary to facility the inspection process and to track the movement of animals. The licensee
must make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose information concerning animals other than
dogs or cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise under his or her possession or
under his or her control or which is transported, sold, or euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by the dealer or
exhibitor. This information includes the name and address of the person to whom the animals are sold or given. To
be corrected with the next animal transaction.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
The food for the three wolf-dog hybrids is being placed directly on the concrete floor of their enclosure. Food placed
on the enclosure floor may become contaminated. Food receptacles must be used for the food of dogs and must
be located to protect the food from contamination. Correct by 27 Aug. 2016.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on 24 August 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
