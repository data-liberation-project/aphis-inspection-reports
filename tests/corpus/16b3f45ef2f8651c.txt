FEEDING.
In a pen housing thirty nine goats and 4 sheep, there was no receptacle for the salt block. The block was on the
ground. The salt block should be in a container that can be cleaned and maintained in a manner that minimizes
contamination of the block. A system should be in place to ensure animal feed stuff is wholesome, palatable, and
free from contamination to maintain all animals in good health.
