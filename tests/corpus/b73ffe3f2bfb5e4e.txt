2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee has failed to provide the Animal Care office with an itinerary. The licensee was contacted by phone
during an attempted inspection of the facility. The licensee indicated that he was traveling on the road with one of
his animals. At that time the Animal Care regional offices had not received an itinerary from the licensee prior to
overnight travel. The lack of a required itinerary was also noted on the inspection reports dated 10/18/2016,
4/28/2016, 6/16/2015, 8/20/2014 and 11/3/2014. The absence of an itinerary inhibits inspection for compliance with
regulations and standards of the Act while the animals are away from the home facility.
The licensee must submit an itinerary to the Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of travel whenever
the animals will be exhibited at a location other than the approved site(s) and whenever travel extends overnight.
The itinerary shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of all animals intended
for exhibition at any location other than the approved site.
Note: This inspection report was sent by standard and certified mail.
