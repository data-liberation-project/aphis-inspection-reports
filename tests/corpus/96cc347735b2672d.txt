SANITATION.
*** The rabbit enclosures need to be addressed. There is an accumulation of feces underneath the wire mesh
enclosures and the enclosure with solid floor has bedding that is wet. These enclosures need to be cleaned more
frequently to prevent this accumulation for the health of the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The exercise yard for the camel does not have shelter from sunlight or inclement weather. The animal is left in
the yard during times the licensee is away and cannot be quickly moved back to the barn. A shelter needs to be
provided so the animal has protection from inclement weather if it chooses. This needs to be addressed for the
comfort of the animal.
