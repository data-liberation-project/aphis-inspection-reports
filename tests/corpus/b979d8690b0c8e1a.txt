ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On August 7, 2015 the attending veterinarian noted that a pregnant adult female Pomeranian, USDA tag 65, had
grade 3 dental disease. According to the program of veterinary care, any non-pregnant animal noted to have grade
3 or grade 4 dental disease should have its teeth cleaned by a licensed veterinarian. The female gave birth and
weaned her puppies prior to the inspection. The female has been since bred and is currently not confirmed
pregnant. The licensee indicated during the inspection that the animals mouth had not been cleaned or otherwise
treated by a veterinarian while the female was not pregnant. The adult Pomeranian, USDA tag 65, was noted to
have severe dental disease during the inspection. The animal had a moderate buildup of tan material on the canine
teeth, and heavy buildup on the pre-molars and molars. Several teeth on both sides of the mouth were loose and
several others were missing. The gums appeared reddened and were receding from the teeth.
The program of veterinary care as well as instructions from the attending veterinarian should be followed to ensure
adequate care for the animals. Untreated dental disease may lead to problems consuming food as well as several
conditions, such as cardiac disease, that affect the health and well-being of the animal. The licensee shall have
appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other
aspects of animal care and use.
