2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* There was no record of animal inventory on an estimated 350 guinea pigs at the time of inspection. Complete
and accurate records are necessary to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate
the ability to trace those animals. USDA Official 7019 forms were provided to the licensee. The licensee must
maintain complete and accurate records of all animals that were purchased, owned, held, leased or is otherwise
under their possession or control. In addition, these records must be available to the inspector at the time of
inspection. Correct by 4/10/16.
3.25(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* A buildup of excreta was observed in at least one enclosure housing 12 guinea pigs. The affected enclosure is
located in indoor housing. The excreta were covering an estimated 50 percent of the available surface area. The
bedding material was compacted when touched. The licensee stated that the last time fecal waste had been
removed from the enclosure was 12 days ago. Unsanitary living conditions exist that could lead to potential
contamination, odors or disease risks. The licensee shall remove all animal waste and bedding so as to minimize
vermin infestation, odors and disease hazards. Correct by 3/17/16.
3.26(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
* There was a strong odor upon entering the indoor building housing 350 guinea pigs. The inspector felt a burning
and stinging sensation to the eyes and nasal cavity upon entering the building. The strong odor continued all during
the inspection. The licensee did turn on an exhaust fan located on the east wall during the inspection. The building
does have functional windows that remained closed during the inspection. Poor or inadequate ventilation can
negatively impact the animals(cid:25) respiratory function, aid in the spread disease and cause physical discomfort which
affects the health and well-being of the animals. Adequate ventilation is important for improved lung function,
decreasing airborne infectious agents, improving comfort and helps with thermoregulation of the animals. The
licensee must provide adequate ventilation or air exchange at all times to improve the air quality and to minimize
drafts, odors and moisture condensation. Correct by 3/17/16. 3.29(a)
FEEDING.
* The metal food preparation / storage trey has a collection of dust and unfed feed collecting in the bottom of both
treys. The affected trey is located in the indoor building housing 350 guinea pigs. The nutritive value could be
affected if the feed becomes contaminated. It can harbor bacteria and other disease causing agents that can affect
the health of the guinea pigs. The licensee must ensure that all supplies of food shall be free from contamination
and be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to meet the normal daily requirements of the guinea pigs. Correct by
3/17/16.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
* Cobwebs were observed collecting on the enclosure wood boards just above the second row of enclosures
housing 60 guinea pigs. The affected area is located in indoor housing. This indicates a breeding and living area
exists for rodents, pests and other vermin. Unsanitary living conditions and the potential spread of disease exists if
the affected area is not kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products or discarded matter. Allowing
cobwebs to collect on the enclosure boards could impact the health of the guinea pigs. The licensee must ensure
that all buildings shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate prescribed husbandry
practices. Correct by 3/17/16.
* The facility inspection done on 3/10/11 and the exit briefing done on 3/14/16 were conducted with the licensee.
