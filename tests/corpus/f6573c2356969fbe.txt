FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The two camels were moved from the round pen adjacent to the lower barn to an enclosure on the hill. Although
the animals have a shaded tree line, there is still no shelter provided to protect the animals from inclement weather.
The licensee states it may be up to a month until a shelter can be built for the animals. This area of PA has
continued to have rain in the forecast and a shelter shall be provided for all animals housed outdoors to afford
protection from the elements.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
