3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris,
and at least once every two weeks.
Accumulations of debris were seen in approximately 70% of enclosures, most notably alongside the interior
enclosure walls. The debris accumulation along the walls appeared to be adhered to the enclosure surfaces.
Accumulations of debris can create health hazards for guinea pigs. Although the facility representative indicated that
enclosures are cleaned on a regular basis, the presence of the debris alongside the walls illustrated that the
enclosures must be cleaned more thoroughly and/or more frequently to prevent debris accumulations.
The licensee must thoroughly clean and sanitize the enclosures at least once every two weeks or more often as
necessary to prevent an accumulation of debris. Correct by December 26, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
