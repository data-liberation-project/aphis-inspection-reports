3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Most of the large enclosures housing the adult cats have excessive rust accumulation on the metal framework. The
rust is on the bases of the door frames, in the bottom corners of the door frames, and in the lower corners and sides
of the enclosure supports.
The rust has gotten to the point of pitting and flaking which cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized, and can
cause disease hazards.
The licensee must repair or replace the rusted areas of the enclosures. The licensee must create and follow a
regular program of maintenance to ensure that all surfaces are free of excessive rust that prevents the required
cleaning and sanitization at all times.
To be corrected by April 16, 2016.
3.2(d)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The flooring in the entrance of each large enclosure housing the adult cats is chipped and peeling up on the edges,
creating a gap between the flooring and the concrete underneath. These gaps have dirt, hair and debris in them. In
addition, it creates an area that is not impervious to moisture, and therefore cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized.
Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized, and can cause disease
hazards.
The licensee must have the flooring repaired or replaced. The floors and walls of indoor housing facilities, and any
other surfaces in contact with the cats, must be impervious to moisture at all times. To be corrected by April 16, 2016.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The enclosures in the cattery still need to be cleaned more often and more thoroughly. There is an excessive
buildup of grime, hair, and urine on the wire and on the PVC pipe and metal bases of the most of the large
enclosures housing the adult cats. Cleaning and sanitization was also cited on the report from the inspection
conducted on July 28, 2015. The licensee was cleaning the cattery when the inspector arrived, but the excessive
buildup of grime indicates it has not been cleaned thoroughly for at least several days.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned daily to prevent an excessive accumulation of excreta and food waste to keep
from soiling the cats and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures be cleaned at least daily and sanitized at least once every two
weeks or more often if necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
3.12 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The facility was again observed to have an excessive accumulation of grime, hair, urine and other debris on
surfaces throughout the cattery. Although the licensee hired two employees since the inspection conducted on July
28, 2015, one of them no longer works there, and the other is no longer able to help as often as necessary. From
the conditions of the cattery during the inspection, it is obvious the licensee is falling behind again and is unable to
keep the cattery up to the proper husbandry standards with one intermittent employee.
Each person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations must have enough employees to carry out the level of
husbandry practices and care required in this subpart.
The licensee must acquire employee(s) to help with cleaning, maintenance and husbandry practices to maintain the
health and well-being of the animals in the facility.
