FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an excessive amount of feces in the corner of three enclosure cages housing nine rabbits. The licensee
stated the fecal waste was removed two weeks ago. Accumulations of fecal waste can lead to strong odors and
attract pests. In addition, waste can pose a disease hazard which can have a negative impact on the health and
well-being of the rabbits. The licensee shall have provisions for the removal and disposal of animal and food waste,
bedding, dead animals and debris to minimize vermin infestation, odors and disease hazards. Correct by 4/13/18.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The outdoor enclosure containment fencing in three separate areas have become detached along the bottom
creating areas for potential escape by regulated animals or allowing predators to enter the enclosure housing 63
animals. Closer observation shows the wire moving freely creating a four to six inch gap between the fencing and
the ground. The ability to contain the animals securely is greatly affected and could lead to potential injury, if the
enclosure fencing is not kept in good repair. Containment of animals at all times is necessary for protection from
potential escape or injury which could have a negative impact on the well-being of the animals. The licensee must
ensure that outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals. Correct by 4/13/18.

* One sheet of tin was not attached creating a gap in the tin sided outdoor sheltered enclosure. Sixty three
animals are in contact with the affected enclosure located in outdoor housing. Getting caught could lead to
potentially injury causing stress or discomfort. In addition, the ability to provide protection from the elements has
been altered because of the gap that exists. The licensee must ensure that outdoor housing facilities shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by 4/13/18.
* Facility inspection and exit briefing done on 3/29/18 were conducted with the licensee.* Copy of the inspection report was sent by electronic mail.
