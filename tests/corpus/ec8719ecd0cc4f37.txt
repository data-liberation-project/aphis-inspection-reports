2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The written program of veterinary care on file does not include all the species currently housed at the facility. The program
of veterinary care needs to be updated to include the rabbits. Licensee must ensure that the program of veterinary care
includes new species so that the attending veterinarian can give adequate guidance on their care and methods to
prevent, control and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by February 25, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
