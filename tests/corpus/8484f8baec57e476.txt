A male Maltese, microchip #100278539, "Tornado", was observed with a dirty face and a dark colored discharge
from his eyes. Closer observation showed that this dog has reddening of the gum line above the canine tooth and
some of the upper front teeth on the left side. These teeth were mostly covered with a dark colored substance. On
the upper right side there is reddening of the gum line above the cheek teeth and there are also small pockets of
whitish colored creamy substance at the gum line of these teeth. These teeth were also mostly covered with a light
brown to tan colored substance. As the inspectors were observing the mouth of this dog he was producing bubbles
of a clear discharge from his nose. These signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease, can be painful,
lead to the development of other health problems, and can inhibit the ability of the animal to eat normally.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
establish and maintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries at all times.
