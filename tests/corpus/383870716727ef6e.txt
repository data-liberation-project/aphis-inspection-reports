2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***An IACUC Protocol Amendment Request was not sent regarding the dose to be administered to twelve
nonhuman primates, and thus was not approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). An
amendment had to be submitted and approved before Phase 2 of this protocol was to begin. After the IACUC
learned of the missing amendment, the Principal Investigator was contacted and submitted an amendment, which
IACUC subsequently approved.
Unapproved significant changes to a protocol can result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animals'
welfare at risk. Unapproved changes also prevent the IACUC from having the proper authority to assure the proper
care and use of animals in research projects.
With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall review and
approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or withhold approval of proposed significant changes
regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.
This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on August 14-15 and the exit interview was conducted
with facility representatives on August 15th.
