Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The licensee transported a young female African crested porcupine to auction. The animal was contained in a plastic
travel crate (#910) that did not have any bedding.
Travel crates with solid bottoms must have absorbent bedding to prevent the animals within from becoming soiled by their
own waste. Animals who become soiled with fluids or waste may become cold or stressed, or may be exposed to
diseases carried by other animals above them.
Correct from this day forth (December 2, 2021) by ensuring that primary enclosures used for transport with solid floors
have a safe and suitable absorbent bedding in sufficient quantity to absorb and cover excreta.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The licensee transported 1 young female African crested porcupine (#910) in a plastic pet taxi which was not marked on
the top and one or more sides with the words “Live Animal” or “Wild Animal”.
“Live animal” signage, with directional arrows, protects animals in transport cages/crates by identifying the contents of the
carrier as living animals and alerting personnel to the correct upright orientation of the cage or crate.
Correct from today forth (December 2, 2021) by transporting animals in enclosures that are labelled with the words “live


animal” in letters not less than 1 inch in height, with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the
container.

Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.
2 juvenile guinea pigs (tag #917) were transported in a wire cage that did not have projecting rims or other devices on the
exterior walls to prevent obstruction of ventilation. The cage did not have handholds or other devices to enable to the
enclosure to be lifted without tilting, and to ensure that personnel do not come into contact with the guinea pigs.
Personnel handling cages or crates of animals may be injured if handles are not available, causing the personnel to come
into contact with animals during movement and handling of cages/crates. Animals may be injured or stressed if crates are
tilted or dropped due to lack of handles. Projecting rims or other devices are essential for preventing ventilation openings
from being blocked so that animals have adequate air for breathing and comfort.
Correct from this day forth (December 2 2021) by transporting animals in enclosures that meet or exceed USDA
transportation standards.
