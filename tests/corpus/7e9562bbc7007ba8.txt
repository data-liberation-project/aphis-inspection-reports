The female snow macaque, Betsy, has a dull dry haircoat. She is missing hair in areas on both sides of her body
and both rear limbs. In addition, she has had "scours" for the last two days. The facility representative reports that
she has been improving and thinks she ate some bad food. This is evidenced by a moist and brown stained area of
hair on and around her tail. The attending veterinarian has not been contacted yet. Appropriate veterinary care is
necessary to ensure that medical problems are addressed to ensure the health of the macaque. The faciltiy shall
have their veterinarian evaluate the female snow macaque in order to establish an appropriate treatment plan.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The refrigerator was noted to be empty. A box containing a few apples, several of which appeared brown, mishapen
and had a rotten odor where stored on the floor of a shed structure. On a shelf in this same structure were cans of
fruit in light syrup and cans of vegetables. The majority of the shed structure contained all sorts of equipment and
machinery including potentially toxic substances such as oil. Food must be stored appropriately to ensure its
nutritive value. All food shall be stored in manner to prevent their contamination and deterioration; foods requiring
refrigeration must be stored accordingly. In addition foods should be stored seperately from all potentially toxic

FEEDING.
The diet for two snow macaques consists of dry dog food, canned fruit, canned vegetables and occasional apples
and sweet potatoes. The female snow macaque has evidence of hair coat thinning over her trunk and legs and has
some evidence of diarrhea around her tail area. There has not been an evaluation of dietary needs of these
monkeys to determine whether this combination of feed meets their nutritional requirements or how much of these
foods to feed them. Insufficient quantity and/or insufficient nutritive value of feed can lead to health conditions in themonkeys. The facility shall consult with their veterinarian to determine a daily diet plan for the snow macaques that
is appropriate for their species and the conditions in which they live. Correct by April 7, 2014.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
One enclosure houses two snow macaques. An electric box outlet hangs adjacent to the cage. The animals can
reach through the bars of the enclosure and reach it. The owner reports it is not currently turned on but it may still
pose a hazard to the animals chewing on wires or if someone accidentally turns on the electricity to the box. In
addition, strands of wire are being used to fasten a handle to a cage shift door. These wires are long enough that
they bend back into the enclosure. The macaques may reach out and grab the wires and their sharp points leading
to injury potential. The premises around the macaque enclosures shall be kept clean and in good repair to protect
the non-human primates from injury. Correct by March 24, 2014.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The two African crested porcupines currently are housed in metal enclosures. There is damage to the edge of the
metal enclosure material adjacent to the door resulting in sharp points and some loss of integrity where the metal
mesh joins the solid metal edge. The animals may injure themselves on the sharp points and loose metal. Housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. Correct by April 7, 2014.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The pig enclosure housing 6 pigs has a drainage issue. The ground consisted of thick mud and areas of standing
water. The pigs legs and feet were coated in mud and the mud reached up the their bellies. The only drier ground
was in the small shelter structure. Constantly standing in mud can lead to feet and limb issues. The pigs shall be
provided with a dry section of ground via a suitable method of rapidly eliminateing excess water to allow them to get
out of the mud for feeding and drying out. Correct by April 7, 2014.
