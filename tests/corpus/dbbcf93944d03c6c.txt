ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:10 p.m. on
28-Mar-19. In addition to waiting 39 minutes, I honked my vehicle horn, knocked on the house door, called the
phone number provided and left my business card in the door. No responsible adult was available for inspection.
This attempt inspection will be sent by regular mail.
