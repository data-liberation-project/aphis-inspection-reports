3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The required plan to exercise dogs at the facility was found to be incomplete at the time of inspection. The plan was
dated February 26, 2015; plan has not been approved by the facility's current Attending Veterinarian (AV). Dealers
must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. In
addition, the plan must be approved and revised by the facility's active/current AV. The facility and the AV must
ensure that written standard procedures are to be followed in providing the opportunity for exercise.
The AV-approved plan must be made available to APHIS personnel upon request during inspections. The facility
needs to present their exercise plan to the current AV for review and approval.
