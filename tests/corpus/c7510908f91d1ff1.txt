2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care is not currrent or complete. Since the program was written, the vaccination
schedules for the puppies and adult dogs have been modified. In addition, the facility is regularly performing
dewclaw removal and tail dock procedures. There is no written documentation that shows guidance given to the
facility regarding the age at which these procedures can be performed or the methods and instructions (such as but
not limited to instruments to be used, any medications to be used or how complications are to be dealt with) to be
followed when performing the procedures. A current and complete written program of veterinary care is necessary
to ensure adequate and appropriate veterinary care for the dogs. The facility's arrangement with the attending
veterinarian shall include a complete and up-to-date written program of veterinary care. Correct by 5/1/14.
2.50(b)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The facility uses the microchipping method to identify adult dogs. However, it was noted by using a microchip reader
during the inspection that only two of three dogs over 4 months of age in two cages in building 1 were microchipped.
Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate
record keeping requirements. When dogs are held, purchased or otherwise acquired they shall be immediately
identified. Correct by 4/7/14.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In several enclosures housing female dogs with their young puppies it was noted that the feet of the puppies were
passing through the openings in the floor if the puppies left the corner of the cage containing the soft fabric "nesting"
material. This may lead to injury to the puppies and may be uncomfortable for the puppies. The floors of all
enclosures shall be constructed in a manner that protect the dogs' feet and legs from injury and if of mesh or slatted
construction do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any openings in the floor. Correct by 5/1/14.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility represenative.
