CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Mouse droppings were observed in some of the indoor dog enclosures of the whelping building, under the stack
cages, and on the shelf around the room. Rodents can transmit diseases to the dogs and can contaminate the
dogs' food. A better method of pest control must be established and maintained to promote the health and
well-being of the dogs and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct by 15 May 2017.
This inspection was conducted with a facility alternate. The phone exit interview was conducted with the facility
representative.
