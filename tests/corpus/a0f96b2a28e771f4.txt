3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In hoof stock barn #3, the bottom portion of a metal door in the eland's stall #2 was rusted, creating metal edges.
This issue was identified by APHIS during the previous July inspection. To date, the door has not been repaired.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair.
All enclosures must be free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to protect the animals from
injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Vice President for Animal Care.
