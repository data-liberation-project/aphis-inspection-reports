ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was no program of veterinary care available for review at the time of the inspection. The written program of
veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the attending veterinarian in
regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. It outlines preventive veterinary care practices, such as
deworming and vaccinations. The facility should ensure that the written program of veterinary care is available for
review during USDA inspections.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner.
