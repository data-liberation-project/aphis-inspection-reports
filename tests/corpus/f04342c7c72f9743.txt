3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The ceiling of the Brocket deer shelter still has peeling paint along the front wall as well as in the center of the stall. The
brown water stains are also still present on the ceiling. The cause of the leak should be addressed and the damaged
ceilings repaired to keep the facility in good repair.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Curator.
