SANITATION.
***Goat Pen: The hay cover has several holes. The holes will allow rain to pass through. Excessive moisture of the
hay could lead to mold and reduce the nutritive value of the hay. The hay cover must be repaired or replaced to
adequately protect the hay from excessive exposure to moisture and to ensure the hay the goats receive is
wholesome. Correct by May 30, 2016.
***Deer Pen - tin shelter: The bottom edge at the back of one shelter is showing wear. The damage leaves a rough
edge and creates a gap between the ground and the bottom of the shelter. The shelter should be kept in good
repair to ensure animals are not exposed to excessive water leakage and to prevent injury. The shelter must be
repaired to close the gap and smooth the edges to prevent water from coming into the shelter and ensure no
animals are injured. Correct by June 3, 2016.
