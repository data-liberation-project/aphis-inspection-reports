INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 13/14.B/45-A approved on 2/26/2014, and expiring 2/25/2016, describes a procedure where capsules are
adhered to shaved skin on the backs of rabbits. The protocol states there are no procedures occurring which will
cause pain or distress, beyond mild, momentary discomfort. There was no description of the use of anesthetics or
analgesics in the approved protocol.
Upon reviewing drug logs, it was discovered that five rabbits were anesthetized with Ketamine and Midazolam
under this protocol, on 7/25/15.
The attending veterinarian explained that he felt it would be less stressful for the rabbits. This change to the protocol
was not approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC must approve all significant changes to the proposed use of animals, so that they have the opportunity
to consider the impact on the animals on study.
To be corrected from this time forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Upon reviewing drug logs, it was discovered that five rabbits were anesthetized with Ketamine and Midazolam
under Protocol 13/14.B/45-A, on 7/25/15.
The vial of Ketamine used for this procedure had an expiration date specified as "06/15", and the vial of Midazolam
had an expiration date specified as "4/1/2012".
Although no adverse effects were noted in this case, the use of expired drugs could be hazardous to the well-being
of the animals. Appropriate veterinary methods should be provided for animals on study, at all times.To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with program representatives.
