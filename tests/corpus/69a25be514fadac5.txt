3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
In an outdoor enclosure containing 4 adult dogs, the fencing around the dog shelter has become loose and created a gap.
The gap is large enough for a dog's head or leg to fit in and potentially cause injury to the dogs.
Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The licensee must repair the
gap in the fence and ensure that the housing facilities are safe for the dogs at all times

3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
In the food storage room, there are two pallets of dog food and one pallet of wood shaving bedding being stored against
the walls of the room. There is approximately one handful of dog kibble present on the floor between the wall and one
pallet of food. There is also cobwebs present in the same space as the spilled dog kibble.
Food and bedding stored against walls does not allow for cleaning around the pallets of supplies. Spilled food that has not
been cleaned up may attract vermin to the feed storage room and cause the supplies to become contaminated. The
licensee must store food and bedding away from the walls enough to allow for cleaning around the food and bedding
supplies.
