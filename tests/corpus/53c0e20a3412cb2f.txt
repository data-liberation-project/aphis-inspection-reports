2.50(c)

Time and method of identification.
The wolf-dog hybrid named Grace does not have official identification as required by the Animal Welfare Act. All dogs
need to be appropriately identified to allow medical and legal tracking. All dogs shall be identified by one of the methods
allowed under the Animal Welfare Act Regulations such as tag, tattoo or microchip number. Correct by 05/15/2022.
2.75(a)(2)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is not using APHIS Form 7005 to record the acquisition information of the wolf-dog hybrid Grace. The use of
APHIS Form 7005 is required by the Animal Welfare Act and aids in the uniform identification of dogs and tracking
inventory. The facility must document and maintain all of the required acquisition information for the wolf-dog hybrid in an
APHIS 7005 form. APHIS 7006 forms must be used to document disposition information of dogs from the facility. To be
corrected by 4/22/2022.
2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
During inspection, a child was seen reaching through the gap in the primary enclosure fencing to pet a goat. A sign at the
front of the enclosure housing pigs and goats indicates that patrons can “pet animals at their own risk”. A readily


identifiable employee was not present at the time of inspection and per the licensee an employee is not assigned to
monitor this location during periods of public contact. Without an attendant present to monitor the interaction, the safety of
the animals and the safety of the public cannot be assured. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable
employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. To be corrected by 4/29/2022.
3.8

Exercise for dogs.
The exercise program for the wolf-dog hybrid Grace was not documented and was not approved by the attending
veterinarian. An exercise plan ensures the animals are receiving an adequate opportunity for exercise and physical
movement. The applicant must develop an exercise plan with the attending veterinarian that documents the frequency,
method, and duration of exercise for the wolf-dog hybrid. To be corrected by 4/22/2022.
3.81(c)(2)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
A singly housed female Squirrel Monkey named Stanley had significant hair loss on her tail and was seen plucking at the
remaining tail hair at the time of inspection. The licensee explained that this hair plucking behavior has been ongoing
since she was acquired approximately 6 years ago. The facility has put in place several measures to address and mitigate
this stereotypic behavior however these measures were not documented in the non-human primate environmental
enhancement plan. A well-documented and implemented enrichment plan is essential to prevent distress and maintain
the psychological well-being of the non-human primates. The enrichment plan must be updated in consultation with the
attending veterinarian and documentation maintained to reflect actions taken to address animals with stereotypical
behaviors. To be corrected by 4/22/2022.
