2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public barrier around the wolverine enclosure to the left of the glass viewing area still does not prevent
guests from having contact with the enclosure and potentially the animals. The inspector was able to reach across
the barrier and grab onto the chain link fence. For the safety of the animals and guests the barrier needs to be
moved back or raised up so there is a sufficient distance and guests are not able to touch the enclosures or
potentially the animals.
At the last inspection the facility had indicated that it was making progress in funding and planning out the removal
of old fence and construction of new fence that would have been further back and higher to prevent guests from
being able to touch the primary enclosure. The facility has not completed this project but has closed the park for the
season.
The fencing around the wolverine exhibit needs to come into compliance by the time the facility opens in the spring
for the safety of the guests.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative at the time of the inspection.
