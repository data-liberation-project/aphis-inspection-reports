ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:25 to 13:30
pm on 12-APR-17.I left a message on the licensee's main phone and cell phone, and texted his cell. I also left a
message on the animal caretaker's phone. No response was received. We waited for over an hour. We were about
to leave and the animal caretaker drove out. She said that she had not received the message. We could not
conduct the inspection because she was not an authorized person and was not authorized to conduct inspections in
the absence of the owner. The animal caretaker tried to call the licensee, who was out of town, but was not able to
obtain authorization to accompany us on an inspection.
