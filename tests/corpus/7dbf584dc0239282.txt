****There was a Llama and a donkey on exhibition with the hoof growing to the side and cracked hoves, because
they have not been properly trimmed.
****Hoof overgrowth or cracked hoves may create discomfort when the animal is walking and grazing on the pasture
and may predispose the animal to lameness and other medical conditions.
****Proper and timely hoof trimming should be done as needed in order to prevent discomfort and or painfull
conditions to the animal.
