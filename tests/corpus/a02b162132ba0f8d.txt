3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
One adult male Wallaby named “Ben” had died after closing on 9/16/2020. The morning of 9/17/2020 the Bird and Reptile
Manager found the wallaby had fallen into the aquarium at the back of the enclosure and drowned. Inspector was told by
the Support Manager that the wallabies are allowed access to the water in the aquarium. Along the left side of the
aquarium is a concrete structure with stairs leading up to the top of the aquarium, that allows them access to the water.
The evening of 9/16/2020, construction work was being done on the floors. Support Manager told the inspector that the
noise may have frightened the wallaby causing it to jump into the water. The aquarium had no climbing structures on the
inside to assist the animal to safely climb out of the water. The facility has implemented new procedures since the
incident. Before staff leaves for the day a rubber platform is attached to the aquarium and netting is placed over the top.
Facilities that are not constructed with material appropriate to the animals can lead to injuries or death. Housing facilities
must be constructed of such material and such strength as appropriate for the animals involved and shall be structurally
sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals.
