The 8 yr old female cougar 'Sissy" had a small laceration on the top of her right front paw between the third and
fourth digit. The laceration is approximately 1-1.5 inches in length that is spread apart approximately 1/8 inch at the
widest part. There is pink tissue exposed, and possibly some swelling around the injury. The cougar does not
appear to be favoring the paw or in obvious discomfort. The veterinarian has not yet been contacted in regards to
this injury.
Untreated wounds and lacerations can be painful, and if left untreated can increase the possibility of infection and
both situation can affect the health and welfare of the regulated animal.
The licensee needs to consult with their veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the injury.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The female cougar 'Sissy' has a laceration located on the top side of her right front paw between the third and fourth
digit. The injury exposes the pink tissue between the toes and appears a little swollen around the edges of the
injury. It is unclear as to when the injury happened as it was not observed until the inspection. The wound looks at
least 24-48 hrs old, however it was unclear due to the animal pacing. The owner advised that this was the first time
he had noticed the injury.
All regulated animals should be observed daily to make sure they are healthy and have not incurred any injuries,
wounds or illnesses on a regular basis. If daily observations are not made an animal can have a treatable issue
become more serious or chronic if left unnoticed or untreated.
The licensee must make sure to conduct thorough daily observations of the regulated animals to make sure they
are physically and behaviorally healthy.To be corrected by: May 14, 2014

WATERING.
The water pan used for the cougar had a thick layer of algae around the sides and most of the bottom of the pan.
Algae growth can be a source of bacteria and possibly affect the health and welfare of the regulated animal if the
water receptacles' are not kept clean and sanitary on a regular basis.
The water container needs to be cleaned frequently enough to prevent the growth of algae.
