SANITATION.
Although gnats are not present today, they were present in the previous months and have left a brown/black residue
on the walls, ceiling, and overhead pipes. Due to cold weather and inability to move gliders outside to clean, the
residue has not been cleaned off yet.
To be corrected by 5-24-14.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
