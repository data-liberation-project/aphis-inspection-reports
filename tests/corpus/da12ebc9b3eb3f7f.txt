Drainage.
The outdoor paddock area for the teaching horses lacks adequate drainage. There was a puddle of water that took
up most of the center of the paddock, leaving only the corners of the paddock and a narrow space on the edges for
horses to stand out of water. Water pooling in colder months could cause slick/icy spots which may be hazardous
for horses. In warmer months, poorly drained animal areas could increase animals' risks for parasite and disease
transmission. To protect the safety and health of the animals, the facility must ensure methods are in place to
rapidly eliminate excess water.
