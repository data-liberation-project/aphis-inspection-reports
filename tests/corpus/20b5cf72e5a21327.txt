2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection, thirteen macaques were identified with stereotypic behaviors during the inspection and had
not been recorded by the facility. These abnormal behaviors are defined in the facility standard operating
procedure. Because of the lack of identification of these stereotypies, the facility did not have any observation or
treatment plan listed in their medical records for these animals.
The abnormal behaviors included one animal with repetitive spinning (150105), nine animals with alopecia due to
aberrant grooming (160224, 151036, 151138, 133345, 151146, 150939, 160424, 140865, 150726), two animals
with fecal smearing (133099, 160127), and one with alopecia and fecal smearing (140949).
Because of the lack of identification of these issues and despite receiving standard care, these macaques did not
receive special consideration and care necessary according to the facility environmental enhancement plan.
The facility in consultation with a facility-designated veterinarian must assure that a system of observation of
animals is regularly conducted to identify animals with medical or special environmental enhancement needs.
Careful observation and referral for special evaluation and treatment of these animals with consultation with the
attending veterinarian or other designated veterinarian is required to assure optimal psychological and physical
well-being of these animals.
3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The ceiling in room C109 had peeling paint present. Surfaces with peeling paint are difficult to adequately clean
and disinfect, and may create unsanitary conditions. All surfaces should be maintained in good repair in order to
allow proper cleaning and sanitization.
The ceiling in room C106 in the area around the supply vent had condensation, which was reported to be caused by
a sticking valve in the ventilation system. The facility records confirmed that the issue started on the day ofinspection.
Both of these issues were corrected during the inspection.
Facility maintenance is required to provide environmental conditions that support and promote the health and
well-being of the animals. A system of regular review and maintenance of the facility is necessary to assure such
conditions are provided.
This inspection was conducted on 23-24 January 2017 and exit briefing were conducted with facility
representatives.
