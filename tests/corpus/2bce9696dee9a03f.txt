Facilities, general.
While conducting the inspection, one hedgehog was observed to be missing from it’s enclosure. The animal was found
unharmed in the neighboring hedgehog enclosure.
Ensuring animals are continuously contained in their enclosures is necessary to maintain animal health and well-being
and to prevent injury.
All licensees are responsible for constructing facilities of such material and of such strength that they are structurally
sound, maintained in good repair, and contain the animals.

3.126(a) Critical

Facilities, indoor.
On December 11th, the licensee installed a new heating unit in the animal room. The heating unit was not installed with a
thermostat, so the licensee was monitoring room temperature multiple times per day. However, on December 13th,
twenty-one hedgehogs were found dead due to overheating. The licensee immediately had a thermostat installed and has
been maintaining a temperature compatible with animal health and wellbeing.
All licensees are responsible for sufficiently regulating ambient temperatures of indoor facilities using proper heating and


cooling devices to protect the animals from the extremes of temperature, to provide for their health and to prevent their
discomfort.
