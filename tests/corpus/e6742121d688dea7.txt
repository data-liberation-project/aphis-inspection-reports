ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two animals are in need of an examination by the Attending Veterinarian to determine a diagnosis and treatment.
The caretaker noticed a young brown goat limping on its right foreleg several days ago. He suspected it was
bumped by one of the other goats and has been observing it. Because it is still limping continuously, it needs to be
seen by the veterinarian.
An older white female pot belly pig has deeply crusted and flaking skin on her back from her neck to her rump. The
caretaker states it has gotten progressively worse since summer. This skin condition could lead to infection and is
probably uncomfortable. This animal needs to be seen by the veterinarian, so treatment can be initiated.
To be corrected by 12-17-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the caretaker and the Bishop and his wife.
