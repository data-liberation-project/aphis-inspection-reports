ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility acquired a caracal, (cid:28)Ivan(cid:29), on 14 September 2014. Upon arrival, the caracal was showing medical
issues which the facility described as ataxic, spread front legs, lack of coordination, and severely dehydrated. On
15 September 2014, the facility described the caracal'(cid:25)s condition throughout the day as weak, very dehydrated and
uninterested in food. On that evening the caracal experienced an episode of hyperventilation and collapse. On the
morning of 16 September 2014 the caracal was found dead. A necropsy was performed and the results indicate the
caracal was experiencing many medical issues including pelvic and limb fractures.

The facility has a part time veterinarian and a written program of veterinary care in place. During the 2 day period
the caracal received supportive care. However, the caracal was not examined by a veterinarian to evaluate the
medical issues and initiate appropriate veterinary care.
The facility failed to obtain emergency care for the animal as outlined in their program of veterinary care when the
attending veterinarian is unavailable. Failure to obtain emergency care resulted in this animal suffering. This caracal
did not receive appropriate veterinary care based on an assessment by a veterinarian such as medications for pain
and the other clinical signs it was exhibiting.
Ensure that any animal that has severe signs of medical issues receives an examination by a veterinarian and
adequate veterinary care. In the event the facility'(cid:25)s attending veterinarian is unavailable, ensure that the program
of veterinary care is followed and emergency veterinary care is obtained.
Correct immediately.
