SANITATION.
The wire mesh primary enclosure housing "Snowball" is heavily soiled with matted fecal debris and fur along the
entire back floor surface of the cage directly in contact with the animal. There are large quantities of fur hanging
from the top and all sides of the cage.
The wire mesh primary enclosure housing "Cuddles" is heavily soiled with matted fecal debris and fur in the bottom
rear corners of the cage. The wooden nest box within the cage is stained on all surfaces with white mottled spots of
various sizes likely from urine scale.
The accumulation of dirt, debris, and excreta can increase the risk of disease hazards.
