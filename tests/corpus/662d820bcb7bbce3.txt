NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
On January 7, 2016, I cited this licensee for not notifying USDA in writing of changes of business. On January 9,
2016, Mr. Garden sent me any e-mail stating he has vacated this facility and sold his camels. As of todays
attempted inspection Mr. Garden has not notified USDA in writing of any new locations, canceling of his USDA
license or any other changes of business.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 p.m. on

I called the phone number on file for this licensee, however it was not accepting calls. I called the number on the
sign outside the gate and was told that there was a new family living at the home. I attempted an inspection at this
facility on January 7, 2016.
