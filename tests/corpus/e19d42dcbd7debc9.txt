ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was one guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A brown and white adult guinea pig in pen 2 had a
firm movable mass approximately 2 inches in size under its chin. The facility had not observed the condition, had
not contacted the attending veterinarian, and had not administered any treatments. The attending veterinarian was
contacted and was not comfortable with the fact that the facility did not consult with her regarding this animal's
condition and was not treating it according to the program of veterinary care.
Swellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being
of the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and
treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to
additional animals if the condition is contagious.
The facility must contact the attending veterinarian to have the animal evaluated in order to determine an
appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility’s disposition records are incomplete. The sales slips do not include the name and address of the dealer
or person to whom the guinea pigs are being sold.
Failure to maintain sales records that include names and addresses of the buyer can make it difficult to track
animals for trace back and trace forward and to document changes in ownership.
The facility must maintain sales records that include the full name and address of the buyer.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig housing building causing the inspector’s eyesand nose to burn. This was a result of soiled enclosures in need of more frequent cleaning and although some roof
vents were open it was not enough to allow proper ventilation of the room.
Failure to provide fresh air can cause respiratory distress and expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were metal wires attached to the side of the self-feeders with exposed sharp wire tips that were present at
eye level of the guinea pigs in Pens 11 through 16 and Pens 20 through 34. In addition, the area around the
waterers in approximately 90% of the enclosures was chewed resulting in exposed unsealed wood.
Wire tips at eye level of the guinea pigs may result in injury to the animals. Chewed, exposed wood is not
impervious to moisture and can increase the spread of disease through improper sanitation.
Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury
and constructed of material that is substantially impervious to moisture that can be easily cleaned and sanitized.

3.29(d) DIRECT
FEEDING.
Approximately 75% of the self-feeders attached to the inside of the guinea pig enclosures contained fecal material
and bedding material mixed in with the feed. The fecal material appeared dry and not fresh and the feed had
deteriorated to a ground up powder in the trough of many feeders such that there was little to no pelleted feed
available in the trough.
Failure to clean feeders often enough to prevent contamination with fecal material can result in avoidance of food or
spread of disease.
Food receptacles must be located to minimize contamination by excreta and must be kept clean. If self-feeders are
used for the feeding of pelleted feed, measures must be taken to prevent deterioration or caking of the feed.

WATERING.
There was a buildup of bedding, feed, debris, and wet greenish material around the nipples of the automatic
waterers in the floor pens (Pens 1 through 34). There were 6 water bottles attached to the rack of weanling pens
with an accumulation of green material coating the inside of the water bottle.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals. Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the
animals.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Almost all of the guinea pig enclosures contained a large amount of soiled wet bedding with an accumulation of
excess fecal material, debris, and discarded feed mixed in with the bedding and the pens were in need of more
frequent cleaning. The racks of pens with weanlings had a buildup of dirt, debris, and bedding embedded in the
wire mesh on the sides of the enclosures. The facility reported that the enclosures had last been cleaned
approximately 6 days ago.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material
and sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.
Correct by: February 19, 2020
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
There was an accumulation of bedding and debris attached to the walls of the room above the rear of the floor pens.
There was a large amount of spiderwebs mixed with bedding in the corners of the room above two of the floor pens
and above one of the racks of weanling pens. There was dirt and spiderwebs coating the overhead fans.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors,
and may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.
