2.31(d)(1)(iv)(A)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC review of activities involving animal use shall determine that procedures that may cause more than
momentary or slight pain or distress will be performed with appropriate sedatives, analgesics or anesthetics.
*Protocol 0015-0002 approved by the IACUC documents the use of short acting Bupenorphine as an analgesic in
lagomorphs with a frequency of administration once daily.
*Protocol 00117-0001 approved by the IACUC documents the use of Bupenorphine SR as an analgesic in porcine
with an incorrect dosage, frequency of administration every 6-12 hours and a duration of use up to 5 days.
*Protocol 1016-0048 approved by the IACUC documents the use of short acting Bupenorphine as an analgesic in
canines with conflicting frequency of administration information. An appropriate frequency was given, however, a
statement was also included that one dose will provide analgesia for up to 3 days.
The use of appropriate post procedural analgesics should include correct dosages and dosing intervals, according
to established species guidelines/data, to ensure adequate pain relief is provided. Record review and veterinary
staff confirmed that either Bupenorphine had not yet been used or that appropriate dosages and frequency of
administration were used when Bupenorphine was given under these protocols. IACUC review and approval of
protocols containing analgesics should include accurate dosages, frequency of use and duration to provide safe and
therapeutic use of pain relieving drugs in the animals.
