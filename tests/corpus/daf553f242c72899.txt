INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semiannual facility review conducted on 4 April 2014 does not indicated that any chinchillas or chinchilla
housing areas were inspected. However, records for Protocol R 14-009 indicate that from March to April 2014,
there were chinchillas being actively used. On the Program Review under the section titled "Inspection of
Facilities", there is only one reference to chinchillas. The report states " . . . a new chinchilla order will soon return
these animals to housing". Based on this report, it is unclear if the chinchilla housing area was inspected at all. The
semiannual facility review must cover all of the animal facilities, including animal study areas. Future reports must
clearly indicate which areas of the facility were inspected, and any deficiencies or findings.
Correct from this point forward.
2.31(d)(1)(4)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC approved animal use activity (protocol R14-009) involving chinchillas stated " To reduce pain or distress
that may result from the OM, the analgesic Buprenophhine at 0.04 - 0.05 mg/kg, SC or IM will be administered twice
a day throughout the post-inoculation period or by mixing Buprenorphine with drinking water at 0.006 mg/ml to
release discomfort for animals." The medical records and surgery records do not indicate a time, amount, or
frequency of buprenorphine administration. Also surgery records indicate the protocol was not followed in regards to
the post-operative pain management. The PI stated that they were not giving Buprenorphine anymore. Pain
medication had been given in the past, per the PI, but based on their judgement it was not necessary. Specifically
chinchillas number 13-1-3, 13-1-4, 13-1-6, 13-1-7, 13-1-14 and 13-1- 15 did not received pain management
pre-operative or peri-operative during procedures conducted between 14 May 2014 through 14 June 2013.
The failure to follow the protocol and administer the burprenorphine as approved, at the prescribed times and
dosages, may have caused the animals undue pain and distress. The IACUC must ensure that all responsible
personnel follow the approved protocol and that protocols are reviewed and amended as needed.
Correct from this point forward.
2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).The IACUC did not conduct appropriate reviews of the animal activities for protocols R14-009 and R14-001, to
ensure that the principal investigators are following the approved protocols. The animal use activity involved
chinchillas for both protocols.
The principal investigator for protocol R 14-009 and R 14-001 did not follow the approved protocol. In the section
labeled "Describe the the procedures that may cause pain and/or distress to the animal", the protocol states
"..animals in the Exp. Groups will be anesthetized with 0.1ml of a mixture of ketamine (20 mg/ml), xylazine (20
mg/ml), and acepromazine (1 mg/ml) injected im."
There is no record to indicate that acepromazine was administered to any of the test animals.
Protocol R 14-009 further describes monitoring procedures for the period after the procedure is conducted. The
protocol states - "We will evaluate daily symtpoms of distress or severe discomfort such as abnormal body
temperature (body temperature higher than 108 F vs. normal range of 99 - 103 F), labored breathing, dehydration,
abnormal vocalization, movement disorders, and severe deterioration of grooming during the post-challenge
period."
All of the animal health records for active chinchilla protocols were reviewed included the "(cid:28)Individual Animal
Record"(cid:29), "(cid:28)Daily Log(cid:29)", "(cid:28)Surgery Record(cid:29)", and "(cid:28)Procedure Notes" and there is no indication that these parameters
were monitored or recorded.
Regarding anesthesia monitoring, Protocols R14-009 and R14-001 state "The degree of anesthesia will be judged
from the leg withdrawal response to a toe pinch" for monitoring of animals during and after surgery. There is no
record of any anesthetic monitoring taking place, and without adequate documentation it is impossible to evaluate if
the current anesthetic protocol is appropriate.
The IACUC is required to conduct continuing review of all animal activities in order to ensure that they are
conducted
in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations, and in order to ensure that the animals do not experience
any
undue pain and suffering. The IACUC must conduct continuing review of all activities involving animals in order to
ensure that all animal activities are conducted as stated in the approved protocols and in compliance with these
regulations.
Correct from this point forward.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
- The room housing the chinchillas had a heavy accumulation of shavings and droppings on the floor. An air vent in
the room had an excessive amount of dust and hair accumulated on the frame. There were also multiple areas of
peeling paint on the floor and walls of the room. Lack of cleaning and maintenance can lead to unsanitaryconditions which may negatively impact the health of the enclosed animals. Premises must be kept clean and in
good repair at all times.
