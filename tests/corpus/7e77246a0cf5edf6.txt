2.75(b)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for animals at hand containing required information on acquisition, addition and/or disposition of these,
were not complete at the time of the inspection. There were no required records available on the recent acquisition
by donation of one juvenile marmoset. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully
and correctly disclose information on purchased or otherwise acquired animals, and that are in his or her
possession/control. The Record of Animals on Hand (APHIS Form 7019) and Record of Acquisition, Disposition, or
Transport of Animals (APHIS Form 7020) are forms which may be used by the licensee to keep and maintain the
information required by federal regulations. The licensee needs to obtain/document the required information on the
recently acquired animal as soon as possible.
