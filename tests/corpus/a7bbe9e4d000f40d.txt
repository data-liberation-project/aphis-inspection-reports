INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Inspectors reviewed the 5 November 2014 semi-annual facility and program review and found that the findings were
not submitted to the Institutional Official for review. The review also did not state whether or not any minority views
were presented by committee members. In order to ensure that the IACUC has appropriate oversight of animal
activities conducted at the facility, the IACUC members must conduct facility and program reviews at least once
every six months. The findings of these reviews must be reported to the Institutional Official for review. The reports
also must specify if any minority views were presented. The facility must ensure that all semi-annual facility and
program reviews are conducted and presented to the Institutional Official in a timely manner, and also must include
any minority views presented.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Inspectors reviewed Protocol # A186C-US-14-131 and found that there was no written assurance from the principal
investigator that the animal activities do not unnecessary duplicate previous experiments. Principal investigators
must provide assurance that animal activities are not duplicative in order to ensure that animals are not used in
research activities without appropriate justification, and to ensure that a reduction of the number of animals used is
considered. The IACUC must ensure that all approved proposals to use animals contain written assurance from the
principal investigator that animal activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Inspectors reviewed the Rabbit Room Daily Cleaning Log for 1 May (cid:19) 31 May 2014. The log sheet does not
specifically address daily observation of the animals; however, facility policy dictates that animals are to be
observed daily. Inspectors noted that there was no documentation present that addressed any veterinary careissues for this room, nor was there any documentation that the attending veterinarian had been contacted regarding
an injured or ill rabbit. During an IACUC inspection on the 7 May 2014, a rabbit in the aforementioned room was
found to have a (cid:24)skin infection(cid:25) on the left side of the thorax. The attending veterinarian noted that the lesions
appeared (cid:24)deep and penetrated through the dermis.(cid:25) He also noted that the skin appeared (cid:24)thickened and very
hard(cid:25), which could indicate chronicity. The animal was subsequently euthanized due to a poor prognosis. All
animals must be observed daily and any veterinary care issues must be timely and accurately relayed to the
attending veterinarian. The facility must insure that a program is place to insure that all injured animals receive
prompt and adequate veterinary care.
