Facilities, general.
On December 26, 2020, one of the snowshoe hares was not seen during daily observations. The hares are housed in a
large outdoor enclosure containing a number of small, low hutches, open home cages and other hiding spaces for shelter
and cover. The animals have free access to the entire space. The Attending Veterinarian was notified about the missing
animal, and the immediate plan was to continue looking for it since hares are exceptionally good at hiding. After five days
without sighting the missing hare, it was determined she likely escaped when a caretaker entered the enclosure carrying
items that obscured the line of sight to the area around the caretaker’s feet. The hare has not been recovered.
A new SOP was then drafted to help prevent the escape of animals when caretakers entered and exited the enclosure by
ensuring animals aren’t near the door and that caretakers have a clear line of sight to the whole area of the doorway when
the door is open.
While the behavioral changes for caretakers should be helpful, the SOP did not include an additional physical barrier, and
the large enclosures still have a single door entry between the animal space and the large outside area within the
perimeter fence. Enclosures must be constructed in a way that ensures that the animals are contained within. An extra
barrier between the animal space and the outside is an industry standard method to ensure containment.


Correct by initiating steps (state contract process) to increase security of the primary enclosure within 30 days, by May 22,
2021.
