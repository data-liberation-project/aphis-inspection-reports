2.75(a)(2)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee was not using the required APHIS Form 7005 to make, keep and maintain the information required by 2.75
(a)(1). The licensee was using a computerized recordkeeping system to maintain the information but did not have an
approved variance to use the computerized records in lieu of the APHIS Form 7005. Some disposition and acquisition
information was missing from the forms printed out during the inspection. Required records which accurately reflect
acquisition and disposition information are important for the tracking and tracing of animals. The licensee must request a
variance in order to make, keep, and maintain the information that is required on the APHIS Forms 7005 and 7006 using
a computerized recordkeeping system.
3.3(e)(1)(ii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The sheltered facility housing 4 female dogs and 21 puppies has cement blocks on the outside portion of the building
which are impervious to moisture. The cement blocks are located at the entrance of the in/out access doors and appear to
function as steps for the dogs to go in and out of the building. These cement blocks could allow water to be soaked into
them. Surfaces which are not impervious to moisture increase the risk that they are not able to be properly cleaned and
sanitized. Surfaces not properly cleaned and sanitized can increase the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must


ensure that outdoor floor areas in contact with animals, when the floor areas are not exposed to the direct sun, or are
made of a hard material such as wire, wood, metal, or concrete are impervious to moisture at all times.
3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.
In the outdoor facility housing 15 adults and 4 puppies there were concreate blocks at the entrances of the shelters within
each primary enclosure which were not impervious to moisture. The cement blocks could allow water to be soaked into
them. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture increase the risk that they are not able to be properly cleaned and
sanitized. Surfaces not properly cleaned and sanitized can increase the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must
ensure that building surfaces in contact with the animals are impervious to moisture at all times.
