Watering
In two enclosures, both with 2 dogs, there were empty water bowls, with no other water available. When water was
presented, the dogs drank for a few seconds. Lack of water could cause the dogs to become dehydrated or other health
issues. Having potable water available continuously is important to the health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure all
dogs always have access to potable water.
Corrected during inspection.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
A live mouse was noted in building #3, dead mice were noted on glue traps in building #2 and a large amount of rodent
feces was noted along the central walkway in building #4. The rodent feces noted in building #4 extended the entire
length of the central walkway. The licensee was currently using glue traps; however, these products were not effective for
the control of the rodents at the entire facility. Rodents and other pests can carry diseases and pose potential health
hazards to the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective protocol for the control of rodents
and other pests to reduce disease hazards. To be corrected by: November 17, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
