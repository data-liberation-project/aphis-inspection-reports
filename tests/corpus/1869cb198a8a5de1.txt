2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During routine cleaning on December 13th, 2015, multiple doors were left open between the primary enclosure
housing the red fox and the outside of the facility. The red fox escaped through the open doors and ran into the
woods that surround the facility. The facility representatives have made several attempts to capture the animal, but
have been unable to do so. Improper handling practices (i.e. leaving the doors open during cleaning) led to the
escape of the fox. An animal escape can cause severe distress, trauma and/or physical harm to the animal.
Handling of all animals must be done as carefully as possible and in a manner that cannot lead to an animal escape
which can cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort for the animal.
To be corrected from this day forward.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with a facility representative.
