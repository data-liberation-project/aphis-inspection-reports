ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care is incomplete it does not include the appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries for the bison, camels, capaybara, cavey, and bobcat/savannah cats. The
program of veterinary care is signed by the veterinarian but not by the licensee. A complete program of veterinary
care must be established and maintained addressing the appropriate treatments for all of the animals.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
During the inspection there were no records available for the USDA Animal Care Inspector to examine related to the
acquisition of the four American Bison, common marmoset, bobcat/savannah cat hybrid, 2 red ruffed Lemur, and 1
patas monkey. There were no disposition records for 2 servals, 2 ringtail lemur, a capybara, and 3 camels. There
was no current inventory available. Accurate, complete and current records must be created and maintained for
APHIS Officials so that they may monitor the movement of animals. to prevent the illegal movement of animals and
to protect the health and welfare of the animals being used for activities regulated under the Animal Welfare Act.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The resting shelf boards in the rhesus macaque enclosures are no longer attached and hanging loose in the
corners. *In Enclosure #3 with housing the capuchins, the plastic shelter barrel has dislodged from the outside wall
and is hanging at an extreme downward angle.
*The door frames in the separate enclosures housing the rhesus macaques, mandrill, spider monkey and gibbon, in
addition to the metal supports on the doors to the keeper area in the mangabey and gibbon enclosures are rusty.
Rust does not allow the enclosures to be cleaned and sanitized appropriately.
*There are sharp ends of wires exposed in the shelter for enclosure #4 housing the Diana guenon, capuchin,
mangabey and spider monkey. There are sharp ends of wires exposed in the enclosures for the marmoset, a pair
of ringtail lemurs, a pair of ruffed lemurs, and 3 capuchins.
*The back section of wire mesh is unsecured from the back of a lemur enclosure.
*There are metal wire shelves in the capuchin and lemur enclosures across the creek which have peeling paint. Acouple of these enclosures also have wide gaps on the side or bottom which may allow unwanted animals enter or
the nonhuman primates to injure themselves.
*Many of the lemur enclosures have wooden flooring where the paint has deteriorated or been removed. The bare
wood may not provide for adequate cleaning and sanitation.
The structures within the nonhuman primate enclosures must be sturdily constructed and must be strong enough to
provide for the safe activity and welfare of nonhuman primates. There must be no sharp points that can injure the
nonhuman primates. All of the enclosures and structures within the enclosures for the nonhuman primates must be
altered, repaired, replaced and maintained so that they are safe for the animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*There are accumulations of excreta throughout the outdoor portions of the front nonhuman primate enclosures and
inside the shelters of the gibbons and spider monkeys, which allows the nonhuman primates to come into contact
with excreta. There is accumulations of feces on the wooden wall supports and near the bottom edge of the
mangabey, and gibbon enclosures.
*The entrances to the rhesus macaque enclosures have accumulations of feces and dirt in the door tracks.
*The temporary enclosure for the tamarin was dirty with piles of feces. The shelters for the Lemurs, Celebes and
capuchin on the other side of the creek towards the zebra and camel enclosure contain accumulations of feces and
soiled bedding.
*The marmoset enclosure and shelter were dirty. The fabric hammock/sock hanging on the side of the marmoset
enclosure is soiled, and dirty.
The accumulations of feces may attract unwanted insects and create disease hazards for the nonhuman primates.
The enclosures for the nonhuman primates must be spot cleaned daily, to prevent the nonhuman primates from
coming into regular contact with the fecal material and to reduce disease hazards.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The feed storage shed across the creek is dirty. There are accumulations of dirt, insects, rodent droppings and
food debris on the floor, in the corners, along the walls under and around where the feed is stored. There are open
feed bags. There is an empty, dirty wire cage enclosure containing matted straw and fecal material in the corner.
*The food storage room in the large horse barn is also dirty. There are accumulations of dirt and debris along the
walls, floor, in the corners, under and around shelving and the next to the refrigerator. The refrigerator and freezer
containing fruits, vegetables, meat, supplements and other food items is dirty. There are empty but soiled animalenclosures in the food storage area. There is a tamarin being temporarily housed on the shelving containing
unopened feed bags.
*There are rotten and molding fruits and vegetables contained within the refrigerator. The dirt, rotting and molding
produce can contaminate the food stored in the refrigerator and freezer.
*The dirty empty enclosures, dirt and spilled food debris on the floors, and open bags of grain, may attract
unwanted vermin and insects that can contaminate the food.
* All food must be stored in a manner that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. The food
storage areas must be kept cleaned and organized to discourage vermin and to ensure the food for the nonhuman
primates remains palatable and uncontaminated to protect the health and safety of the animals.
3.75(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are accumulations of feces and food debris behind, next to and around the exterior of nearly all of the
nonhuman primate enclosures that has been washed out of the enclosures. The accumulations of feces and food
debris allowed to remain around the enclosures create unpleasant odors and conditions that will attract unwanted
insects and vermin posing a disease hazard to the nonhuman primates. The facility operators must provide for
regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes in a manner that minimizes
contamination and disease risk.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*On Friday November 21, 2014 the animal caretaker found a Red-handed tamarin dead on the floor of it's
enclosure. The temperatures in this area over the previous 3 nights dipped below freezing and remained below 45
degrees for several hours. The enclosure was examined by the inspector and the shelter was very dirty with feces
and what appeared to be a decomposing animal in it. The companion tamarin was taken inside following the
discovery, so that the caretaker could maintain and monitor it's well-being. The caretaker stated that she believed
the cold temperatures caused the tamarins passing. Sufficient shelter and heat must be provided to the nonhuman
primates at all times to protect them from the cold. If the animals are not compatible and will not take advantage of
the shelter provided, other measures must be taken to ensure the animals are protected from extreme
temperatures.
*Many of the enclosures housing capuchins, and ruffed and ringtail lemurs, do not have sufficient wind or rainbreaks
to keep the nonhuman primates dry and protected during inclement weather. The plastic walled barrels provide
minimal shelter from the elements, leaving nonhuman primates with inadequate protection from rain, wind and cold.

*A couple of the plastic barrels in the capuchin enclosures had standing water in them. There are heat lamps near
the sides of most but not all of the plastic barrels, however, rain and wind may diminish their effectiveness.
*On some of the lemur enclosures and the rhesus macaque enclosures there were roll down tarp material on 2sides to block the wind and rain, however the shelter barrels were on the opposite side of the enclosures which
were then unprotected.
Exposure to rain, wind, and cold may cause discomfort and be harmful to the nonhuman primates health. The
enclosures and or the shelters must be altered to provide protection from the elements at all times.

EMPLOYEES.
There are an insufficient number of trained employees to care for the nonhuman primates. The number of
nonhuman primates in addition to the other animals that require the attention of the current animal caretaker has
increased significantly in number. The conditions and maintenance of the facilities including the structures and
enclosures is insufficient. Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being in addition to the
regular cleaning, feeding and maintenance is most likely not possible with only one responsible caretaker. Although
she is provided assistance on an occasional basis, it is apparent that the help is too infrequent to manage all the
tasks that must be completed. In order to maintain the level of husbandry practices and care required for the
nonhuman primates in the Animal Welfare Act the licensee must have additional trained employees to ensure the
health and well-being of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The fencing that comprises the giraffe enclosure is in disrepair and may be structurally inadequate to contain the
giraffe. There are numerous broken and splintered boards with sharp nails protruding on the ground or hanging
loose from the support posts of the fence. There are broken sharp ends of wires on the wire mesh portion of the
fencing. The wire mesh fencing is bent unraveled and broken. The sharp nails, splintered broken boards and sharp
ends of wires may injure the giraffe.
*There are areas on the kangaroo enclosure's wire mesh fencing that have detached which created openings.
There are several gaps under the fencing which appear to have been dug by other animals.
*The exterior wire mesh fencing that is enclosing the large outer pasture containing the camels, zebra and
Wildebeest is deteriorating and in disrepair. There are several areas that have been damaged and are no longer
structurally stable. There are also areas with excessive plant growth on, in, and over the fencing, which may cause
more instability and damage. This pasture fencing is the only barrier for these animals due to the fact that there is
no perimeter fencing surrounding this area and a large portion of this fencing runs along a public roadway.
Therefore, it is critical that it remains structurally sound and in good repair in order to contain the animals and
exclude unwanted animals and persons from entering. Unwanted animals and people may cause stress and harm
to the animals contained within.
*The fence surrounding the pasture containing seven zebra and a camel is still damaged and in disrepair, there hasbeen no attempt to repair or alter this structure since the last inspection, to ensure it's secure and safe for the
animals. There are large gaping holes with exposed sharp broken wires protruding into the enclosure. On the side
of this enclosure there are several boards that have come loose and are hanging. The holes may allow the zebras
to escape or unwanted animals to enter and harm the zebras and camels. The sharp wires and holes may cause
injury to the animals.
*The board and wire fencing used to construct the enclosures for the animals must be altered, replaced, or repaired
and maintained to protect the animals from injury, contain them securely and prevent access from unwanted
animals and people.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure containing the 4 American Bison is extremely wet and muddy. This area is not draining in a way to
rapidly eliminate excess moisture. The hay feeder is in the center of the corral surrounded by standing water and
mud. There are no areas in the enclosure where the American Bison may lie down or stand that is not wet and
muddy. This may cause stress and discomfort and could lead to health issues for the animals. The enclosure must
be altered to provide for the rapid elimination of excess water, so that the bison will have enough area to escape the
wet mud and remain dry.

SANITATION.
*There is an accumulation of fecal material in the front of the bobcat/savannah cat enclosure.
* The fennec fox enclosures are dirty. There are piles of fecal material scattered throughout the dirt floor. There is
a strong odor associated with the dirty fox enclosures.
* The ground within the cavy enclosure has accumulations of feces scattered throughout
* The giraffe barn is dirty and has accumulations of old feces and straw compressed on the cement floor.
Excessive accumulations of excreta may contribute to contamination, attract unwanted insects and create disease
hazards for the animals. Floors of enclosures comprised of soil must be removed and replaced as necessary when
it can no longer be cleaned adequately. In addition, excreta must be removed from the enclosures more frequently
to allow the animals to avoid contact with feces, prevent contamination of the animals and minimize odors and
disease hazards.
This inspection occurred over a 2 day period, November 24-25, 2014.
The exit interview was conducted with the Animal Caretaker.
