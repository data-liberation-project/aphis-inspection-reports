2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two of three rabbits housed in an outdoor enclosure each had one ear that was very crusty with underlying skin that
appeared to be very red and irritated in some areas. Diseases involving the ear can be painful and become infected
causing further trauma and damage. It could also be contagious to other individual animals.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that
all animals receive adequate veterinary care and treatment.
