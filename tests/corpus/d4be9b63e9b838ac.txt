3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.75(c)(3) Cleaning: There are excessive amounts of feces in the bedding on the floors of the enclosures
housing 4 capuchins and 3 ring-tailed lemurs. The enclosures are not being spot cleaned at least once a day.
Accumulations of feces may contaminate the enrichment items on the floor of the enclosures, cause odors, attract
flies and are a potential disease hazard for the animals. The floors of the primate enclosures must be spot-cleaned
daily and sanitized in accordance with Section 3.84 of this subpart to prevent accumulations of excreta or disease
hazards. Correct by June 27, 2015.
3.81(a) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Section 3.81(a) Social grouping: Two capuchins are still housed in enclosures without another non-human primate.
These two capuchins had been previously pair-housed (Sam and Potter) successfully for many years. The facility
environment enhancement plan to promote psychological well-being still describes these capuchins as being pair
housed. There is no documentation to explain why the capuchins were separated. The animal caretaker during this
inspection informed the APHIS official that the plan is to make a door between the two enclosures so the capuchins
can go back and forth as was done for the other two capuchins.

Capuchins are social nonhuman primates and are expected to be housed socially whenever possible. There is no
documentation in the records provided during this inspection that document a reason/explanation for breaking up
the capuchin pair. The facility must follow their environment enhancement plan to meet the social needs of their
non-human primates. This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
Note: The older female goat found in need of veterinary care on the last inspection was seen and treated by the
attending veterinarian.
An exit briefing was conducted with the animal caretaker.
