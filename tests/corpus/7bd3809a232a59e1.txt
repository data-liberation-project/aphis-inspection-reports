2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The licensee did not follow her Program of Veterinary Care when treating her cats for fleas. The Attending
Veterinarian's instructions were to use Frontline and Revolution on alternating months for ectoparasites. Instead,
the licensee purchased an over the counter flea product that was labeled for use only in dogs. This product caused
insecticide toxicosis in seven adult cats and four kittens. Despite treatment by the Attending Veterinarian, all four
kittens died. All seven adult cats survived, but four females later aborted their litters of kittens. Not following the
Attending Veterinarian's instructions in the Program of Veterinary Care can result in the use of inappropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee must follow the Program of
Veterinary Care for her animals.

***The licensee was using medications that did not have labels. She was pouring medications from large bottles of
Albon and Pyrantel into smaller bottles for ease of use. However, these small bottles did not have labels that
indicated what was in the bottles. Medications without labels or with incomplete labels can result in an animal
receiving the incorrect medication, the incorrect dose, or expired medication. The licensee must ensure that all
medication containers are labeled with the name of the medication, the dose to be given, and the expiration date.

2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
(a)(2) Kittens less than 16 weeks of age.
The licensee was not properly identifying kittens comingled from different litters. One enclosure contained 5 kittens
from one litter and 1 kitten from another litter. Another enclosure contained 2 kittens from one litter and 1 kitten
from another litter. These kittens were being identified with cage cards rather than having individual identification.
Appropriate identification of kittens is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition,transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must individually identify kittens that are from different litters
and housed together in the same enclosure.
TO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 24, 2015.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted by Konnie Plumlee-VMO with the licensee.
