Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 504 adult and weaned guinea pigs were
counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records since March 25, 2020, indicating the number of adults,
weanlings, or newborns present for several months.

Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or deceased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use. The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and
correctly disclose the number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths. Correct by

Facilities, general.
At least 6 plastic enclosures had large, chewed holes on the wall surrounding the automatic water valves. The enclosures
with the large and chewed walls around the water valves included pen 4, 9, 39, 40, 44, and 45 housing a total of 47
guinea pigs. The large holes surrounding these water valves could allow smaller weanlings and newborns to be injured
from falling from the racks onto the floor from a distance of 3 to 5 feet. Housing facilities for guinea pigs must be

structurally sound and maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. The above
enclosures must be repaired or replaced to contain the guinea pigs and prevent injury from falling through the large
opening in the wall. Correct by Oct. 10, 2020.
3.31(b)

Sanitation.
Housekeeping. There was an excessive amount of dirt, debris, fecal material, and cobwebs between the 7 racks and on
the drainpipe for the automatic water system. The buildup of dirt, debris, fecal material, and cobwebs can expose the
guinea pigs to health risks. The area between racks and drainpipes for the watering system must be kept clean to protect
the health of the guinea pig colony. Correct by Oct. 1, 2020
