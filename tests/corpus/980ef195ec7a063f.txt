FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** A wooden nest box in an enclosure containing one male raccoon, “Bandit,” had collapsed, causing several nails
to protrude outward from the wood. The raccoon could come into contact with these sharp points.
***A wooden box structure in the raccoon’s enclosure contained a nail head that was protruding from the wood that
could injure the animal.

All enclosures and the structures within must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or
gaps/openings in order to protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and
maintenance must be in place.
