2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
The licensee does not have official tags for the adult breeding stock in the kennel.

All live dogs shall be identified by an official tag of the type described in § 2.51 affixed to the animal's neck by means of a
collar made of material generally considered acceptable to pet owners as a means of identifying their dogs.

Official tags must be acquired as described in 2.51 to identify all dogs held at the facility. Lack of identification makes it
difficult to trace the animal in the event of escape, and to trace and track animal movement. Animals must be properly
identified for APHIS officials to accurately verify animals on hand to the required APHIS Form 7005. Animals must be
identified for APHIS officials to review required medical records.

To be corrected by May 7, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
