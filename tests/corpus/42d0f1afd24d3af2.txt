3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
There are 11 enclosures that contain too many weaned guinea pigs. Space requirements establish that no more than 9
guinea pigs of weaning size may be held in each enclosure. The number of animals in the overcrowded enclosures range
from 11 to 18.
Guinea pigs in cramped housing conditions experience increased stress which negatively impacts their health and well-
being.
Guinea pigs of weaning weight require 60 square inches of floor space per animal. Ensure that guinea pigs are allowed
appropriate space to reduce stress on the animals.
To be corrected by June 7, 2021.
3.53(c)(2) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The licensee continues to keep female rabbits with their litters in 30" by 30" enclosures. At least 3 of these litters are over
the age of 8 weeks.

Primary enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space for the animal to make normal
postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.


Rabbits are typically weaned between 4 and 8 weeks of age. Due to lack of space these litters are not weaned
appropriately. Rabbits need to be properly weaned prior to sale to avoid undue stress of these young rabbits. Proper
space must be offered these rabbits to avoid overcrowding and to offer freedom of movement to assure proper growth
and development.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
