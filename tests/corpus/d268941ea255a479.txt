FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The center of the covered outdoor petting zoo housing goats and other farm animals and other areas at the rabbit
and zebra enclosures have muddy soil and or standing water. Although there has been heavy rains and additional
fill has been added, these areas still remain wet during rainy season. There needs to be a method to rapidly
eliminate the muddy / excess water in these areas to prevent health issues such as foot rot, parasites or disease.
Methods such as adding soil and higher border to contain it, another type of soil, bedding or concrete surfaces were
discussed.

SANITATION.
The camel and goat barn concrete flooring has excessive excreta and puddle of urine at the right front of the
entrance door. These animals would not be able lay during the night without having contact with excreta. It was
stated that the barn is cleaned daily and the animals have access to the outside during the day and inside at night. It
appears due to the space of the barn there needs to be flooring / bedding added so there was no excreta contact
with the animals. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
TO BE CORRECTED: IMMEDIATELY.
