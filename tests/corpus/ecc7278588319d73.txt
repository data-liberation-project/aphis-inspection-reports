FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation. Room # 1 housing 1860 adults Syrian/golden hamsters and their offspring had a strong ammonia odor
at time of inspection. The ammonia odor was strongest near the two front doors located near the hallway. There is a
fresh air vent in the ceiling approximately 1/3 of the way in the room and a rear exhaust fan which was running
every 30 seconds in a five minute interval. Room # 1 is approximately 20 feet by 40 feet with a 9 foot ceiling. The air
circulating fan located near the fresh air vent in the ceiling did not appear to move air in the two front corners of the
hamster room by the doors. Pans and bedding are cleaned at least weekly. The pans and bedding were last
cleaned on Tuesday (2/26/19). The owner was in the process of cleaning pans in this room during the inspection.
Indoor housing facilities for hamsters must be adequately ventilated to provide for the health and comfort of the
animals. Licensee must ensure that hamster room is adequately ventilated at all times to protect the health and
comfort of the animals. The air quality must be improved in room # 1 housing Syrian/golden hamsters to reduce the
buildup of ammonia to protect the health and comfort of the animals. Correct by March 16, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
