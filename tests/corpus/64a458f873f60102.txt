Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were several animals observed with health conditions requiring consultation and treatment by a veterinarian.
The brown alpaca identified on the inspection on 3/2/22 was observed to still have discharge around the upper and lower
lids of the left eye. The licensee began treating the eye with sodium chloride ophthalmic ointment without the guidance of
a veterinarian. The ointment being used was expired (expiration date 2/2021.)
The bobcat that had been observed limping on the right rear leg on the inspection on 3/2/22 was observed to be limping
still on today's inspection. The licensee still has not consulted a veterinarian or administered any treatments to the animal.
The spiny mouse observed on the inspection on 3/2/22 with a wound on the right hind leg had been separated and was
being treated with Animax (antibiotic/anti-inflammatory ointment) but the licensee had not consulted with a veterinarian.
The second spiny mouse observed with a tail wound on the inspection on 3/2/22 had been separated and was being
treated with Animax (antibiotic/anti-inflammatory ointment) but the licensee had not consulted with a veterinarian.
The degu observed with an injury on the back above its tail on the inspection on 3/2/22 was separated and was being
treated with Animax ointment but the licensee had not consulted with a veterinarian.
Health conditions such as abnormal eyes, skin wounds, and lameness can cause pain and distress and worsen if not
treated appropriately in consultation with a veterinarian.

Space requirements.
The facility has degus and spiny mice housed in enclosures that still do not provide the animals the ability to get away
from more aggressive or dominant animals. There are no visual barriers and some animals had ended up with wounds.
Inadequate space can result in injuries and fighting which can cause pain and distress in the animals. The facility must
have enclosures that are constructed and maintained to provide sufficient space to prevent overcrowding
that leads to fighting and injuries in the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
