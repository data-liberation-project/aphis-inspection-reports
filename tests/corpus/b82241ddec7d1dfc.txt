2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
-The male, adult dromedary camel, “Meshack,” has an approximately baseball-sized swelling on the underside of his left
jaw, with a concave central wound draining a thick, white material. The facility representative stated that the attending
veterinarian previously debrided and treated the wound, and prescribed antibiotic treatment, which the facility
administered accordingly. The swelling and draining returned after completion of the prescribed treatment, but the facility
owner did not communicate this to the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian told the inspectors that he
expected the facility to inform him if the problem did not resolve.
-There is one white, adult female goat with an enlarged, right mammary gland that is reddened, with two wounds. One
wound is quarter-sized and surrounded by crust,. A smaller, adjacent wound is linear and fresher in appearance. The
gland swelling is significant enough to cause the teat to occasionally scrape on the ground as she walks. The facility was
aware of the goat's condition but did not notify the attending veterinarian.
Timely reporting of unresolved or new conditions is important to prevent worsening of any problems and ensure proper
care. The facility must have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the attending
veterinarian. Additionally, the two animals listed above must be evaluated by a veterinarian to provide adequate


veterinary care as required in section 2.40(b)(2). Ensure that they are treated in accordance with that veterinarian's
recommendations including any necessary follow-up treatments required.

2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee does not have complete records for acquisition and disposition of animals and many sections of the records
were not understandable. There are instances where goats were noted to be sold more than once and it was unclear
whether dates listed referred to the date born or date sold. The record of animals on hand did not match the inventory of
five goats on the premises.
Records containing the required information for animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including
those offspring born on premise, are necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to
ensure their humane care and use. The licensee shall make, keep and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of
all animals that fully and correctly disclose the required information.

Facilities, general.
-In an enclosure containing four camels, there are several long, detached strands of fencing wire that are laying in the
pasture.
-In an enclosure containing one llama, there is a shelter structure with sharp nails protruding from the ceiling into the
interior. In addition, the sheet metal comprising the walls of the shelter has deteriorated along the bottom, creating sharp
edges.
Fences in disrepair can allow the animals to escape. Loose wire and sharp points and edges pose a hazard for the


animals. All enclosures must be constructed and maintained in a manner to prevent injury and to contain the animals.

Feeding.
-In the feed storage structure there is an uncovered sack that contains the alfalfa pellets for four camels, five goats, one
llama and five alpacas. At the time of the inspection, moths were present inside the sack and in contact with the feed.
-In the goat pen, containing five goats, there is a food receptacle with an accumulation of old, caked feed underneath
fresh feed.
Improper storage and inadequate cleaning to remove old food can cause molding or contamination, impacting the quality
of fresh feed, which can cause illness in the animals.
Adequate measures shall be taken to keep food wholesome, palatable and free from contamination and to prevent
molding, deterioration or caking of food.

Watering.
In an enclosure containing four camels, there are two water receptacles, both of which have a coating of brownish green
film on all interior surfaces and contain cloudy water. Contaminated water can cause illness or be unpalatable to animals.
All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.

3.131(a)

Sanitation.


In an enclosure housing four camels, the pen and both shelter structures had an excessive accumulation of dried and
fresh feces, covering over 75% of the areas. Feces accumulation attracts pests and increases the likelihood of disease
for the animals. Excreta must be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize
disease hazards and reduce odors.
