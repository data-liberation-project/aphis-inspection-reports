In the pig housing facilities, there was a full unlabeled syringe tucked behind the cage card on the door of the
enclosure According to the facility representative, the syringe contained pain medication that was drawn up for that
specific animal for a procedure later in the day.
In one of the procedure rooms, an unlabeled syringe with unknown liquid was adjacent to an automated analyzer on
a lab bench.
Without proper labeling of syringes, there might be unintended use of its contents. Medical items intended for
animal use should be properly labeled and stored.
