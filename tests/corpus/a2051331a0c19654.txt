Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
“Vanna” (microchip # 933000320367519) a 2 year old female Italian Greyhound, was injured on August 31, 2021 and
immediately taken to the attending veterinarian for treatment. The veterinarian diagnosed a broken right foreleg and
placed it in a splint and required cage rest for her until the leg is healed. The licensee has taken Vanna back for regular
rechecks and bandage changes, the last one was 2 weeks ago. At inspection, Vanna has deep wound at the top of the
bandaged area on the top side of the leg near the elbow joint where a strip of the gauze has cut through the skin into the
tissue below. The wound is open, about a ½ inch deep and 1 inch wide, and the exposed tissue is very inflamed and
swollen with some blood present. The two toes visible below the bandaged splint are inflamed and swollen. The
licensee had not noticed the wound.
Licensees must work with their attending veterinarians to properly treat diseases and injuries. Daily observation of the
animals under treatment is necessary to ensure that the treatments are effective and to identify complications so they can
be addressed in a timely manner to avoid further pain and discomfort to the animals .
“Vanna” needs to be seen by a veterinarian today to evaluate the newly identified complications and receive the proper
treatment.
