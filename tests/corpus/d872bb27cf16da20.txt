2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
***On November 20, 2016 a non-human primate died at the facility inside a shipping enclosure awaiting transfer to
another facility. The shipping enclosure was used to recover the animal from sedation which made it difficult to
adequately monitor the animal’s condition. Immediately following the incident the facility conducted an evaluation of
the procedures used to sedate and monitor non-human primates. Procedures must be reviewed and amended to
ensure proper handling of all animals during transport. Correct within 30 days.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the ARC Director.
