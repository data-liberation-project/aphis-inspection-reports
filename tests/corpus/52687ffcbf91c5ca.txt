OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
A ring tailed lemur was obtained and is being housed both inside the residence and in a chain link enclosure inside
a stall in the long barn. Although this barn has a solid back wall and a stockade fence behind that, there is no
separate six foot perimeter fence in front of the barn. There is a fence around the entire property but it is not six
foot all the way around, only the stockade fence along the back of the property. The rest of the current perimeter
fence is a typical live stock wire fence and a wood board fence.
A separate 6 foot perimeter fence needs to be built at least 3 feet away from the front of the barn or a variance
requested for this primate.
To be corrected by 1-30-16.

different animals requiring a perimeter fence. Animals requiring a perimeter fence include two African Crested
porcupine, two coatimundis, two wallabies, 3 camels, and 1 zebra. The hoof stock are in paddocks and the
smaller exotics are in chain link enclosures in stalls in the long barn.
