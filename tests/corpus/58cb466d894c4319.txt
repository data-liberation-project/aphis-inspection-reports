HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wood platform, outside the spider monkey den box, appears to be rotting out, leaving a hole, approximately 12
X 8 inches in size with exposed nails.

At the upper chimp wooden shelter structure, there is a hole approximately 7 in X 4 in on the outside of this
structure. The underlying layers of insulation and other materials beneath the wood are exposed. The facility
representative stated the wood may be rotting due to water exposure coming from the roof. The wood beneath the
hole is flimsy and soft to the touch. The innermost layer is sheet metal. Inspection of the inside of the shelter
structure was done including visual as well as manual manipulations of the building material. The sheet metal
appeared to be intact at this time and there were no areas observed to be tampered with by the animals.

At Q1 chimp housing, a section of the wooden roof over a closed top chimp enclosure is in disrepair.

Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the
animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At the upper chimp food preparation room, there was a mild to moderate amount of rodent droppings present. The
presence of feces can contaminate food and increase disease hazards in this area.
Numerous bees were observed within the spider monkey’s enclosure. Bees can potentially cause physical harm
and stress to animals.An effective program for control of insects, external parasites affecting nonhuman primates, and birds and mammals
that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and
reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following facility non-compliant items were noted:
1) Kinkajou food window: The wood covering the food window is attached by a hinge. The hinge is missing a screw
and the other is loose. The window is large enough for the animal to escape.
This item corrected at time of inspection.
2) Cougar enclosure: A couple of wood surfaces is the enclosure are worn and are beginning to splinter.
3) Kitchen pig area: In the front of one enclosure, the bottom of the fence has curled up and has become unraveled.
There are sharp wires protruding into the enclosure and may injure an animal.
4) Back pig enclosure: The back wall of the sheltered area is constructed of corrugated metal which is broken and in
disrepair, resulting in jagged, sharp, and pointed edges that can injure a pig.
To be corrected by September 1, 2019
5) Lion enclosure section 4, upper pride: The horizontal support bars running along the front of the enclosure have
multiple heavily rusted areas where holes have resulted, including at least 2 joint areas. The presence of rust can
affect the structural integrity of the primary enclosure.

The housing facilities should be structurally sound and should be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the back pig enclosure, there is not sufficient shade provided to allow all the pigs housed in this area to protect
themselves from direct sunlight.
When sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort of the animals, sufficient shade by natural or artificial
means shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At time of inspection there were two noticeable areas where the perimeter fence had been damaged and was no
longer effective. According to the facility representative, this happened after the heavy rainfall and mud slides in
February and March of 2019.
The areas include 1) In the lower section 4, behind the lemur enclosure in the main compound where big cats and
other potentially dangerous animals are housed, there is an approximately 5 X 3 foot hole that is the result of
erosion, along the bottom of the perimeter fence.
This item corrected at time of inspection.
2) At the upper big cat housing area, several sections of perimeter fencing panels have been displaced and
compromised. At least one panel is in leaning against one side of the primary enclosure of two adult tigers. The
perimeter fencing issues do not appear to have an effect on the primary enclosures at this time.
As a corrective measure, the facility has planned to safely move the 2 tigers to another enclosure that has an
effective perimeter fence, by August 15, 2019.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
There was an accumulation of discarded items piled in a holding area adjacent to the back hay storage. The items
included rusty caging material, an old tile, small mammal traps, buckets, containers, and other miscellaneous items.
Accumulations of trash promotes the harborage of vermin.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed
in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There was a mild amount of rodent feces observed in multiple areas of the facility. However, in one outdoor storage
area, there was a moderate amount of droppings present. Although there were several traps at different locations,based on the visual evidence, it does not appear to be effective at this time.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained.
