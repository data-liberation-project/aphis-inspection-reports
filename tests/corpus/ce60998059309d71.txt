HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There are no public barriers preventing the general public from coming in contact with the one adult camel, one
juvenile camel, one red kangaroo, and two grey kangaroos.
Lack of public barrier does not ensure for the safety of the animal or the viewing public.
Barriers restricting the public(cid:25)s ability to come in contact with the animal enclosures must be constructed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**The fencing on the east side of the buffalo enclosure had a tree that had fallen on it causing a 40 foot long section
of 10 foot high chain link fence to become compressed.
**The fencing on the west side of the buffalo enclosure had about 2.5 feet of manure and dirt that had pushed up
against the bottom of the fence causing the fencing to become detached from one of the poles and bow outward.
There was also a 30 foot section of chain link fence that the buffalo had pushed on around the bottom of the
enclosure causing the fencing to become creased and gapping.
Enclosures that are not correctly maintained could allow animals to escape or cause injury.
Enclosures must be maintained so that they are structurally sound.

**One perch in the enclosures with the 3 tigers and another one in the encloses with a liger appeared to have wood
that was damaged and nails that were exposed. Exposed nails and damaged wood can cause injury to the animals.
The perches must be repaired or replaced to ensure for the safety of the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
**There is no perimeter fence around the enclosure housing one adult and one juvenile camel.
**There is no perimeter fencing around two sides of the enclosure housing one hyena.
**The north east corner of the buffalo enclosure that also is part of the perimeter fence for the silver fox and New
Guinea singing dogs had a breach about a foot wide.
Lack of perimeter fencing or adequate perimeter fencing does not protect the animals by restricting unwanted
animals and unauthorized persons from having contact with the animals. Also, without a perimeter fence there is no
secondary containment system.
A perimeter fence must be provided for these two enclosures to keep unauthorized people and unwanted animals
from contacting the camels and hyena. The corner of the buffalo fence that acts as a perimeter fence for the fox and
New Guinea singing dogs must be repaired or replaced.

SANITATION.
Rodent feces were observed in the feed room around loose feed on the shelf where the unopened bags were stored
and under the shelf.
Rodent feces can contaminate the feed and make the animals sick.
A rodent control program should be created and implemented to reduce the risk of rodents. Loose feed should be
cleaned up immediately to prevent attracting the rodents.
