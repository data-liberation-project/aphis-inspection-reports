2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male blonde colored Maltese approximately two years old and identified by microchip number
(0A01657878) is shaking its head and pawing at its left ear. The dog's fur appears wet and discolored around the
left side of its head. The inspector requested the licensee pull the dog from the enclosure for a closer look. The
inspector then observed an abnormal growth on the outside of both ear canals. The dog was flinching while the
licensee was handling the affected areas. Both growths are flesh colored and appear reddened where the dog has
been scratching them. The growth on the left ear canal is approximately the size of a ping pong ball. The one on the
right ear canal appears slightly smaller in comparison. The surfaces of the outer and middle portion of both ears,
including the growths, have an excessive accumulation of dark brown and black waxy material.
The licensee stated the dog was purchased about two years ago. The licensee called the growths a "birth defect"
and stated they were first noticed about a year ago while grooming the animal. The dog was last seen by the
attending veterinarian September 4, 2015. According to the document, the veterinarian did not recommend surgery
at that time due to the procedure becoming "problematic". The document describes the condition as "cauliflower
ears" and does not include a treatment plan. The licensee stated the attending veterinarian told her to keep the ears
clean. The licensee stated she had cleaned the dog's ears approximately 10 days ago. A veterinarian has not been
consulted about the dog frequently shaking its head and scratching its ears.
Continued scratching by the dog can be painful. Dirty ears can cause irritation and discomfort for the dog. The
potential for further health problems exist if the tissue becomes contaminated with excreta causing the affected area
to become irritated or infected. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate
diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to
the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
At least three enclosures being used by Pomeranian dogs in the large white indoor housing facility have broken
rusty wire flooring that is creating sharp points.
An enclosure in the whelping building containing an adult boxer and six puppies has a wooden board with at leasttwo sharp screws sticking out of it the dogs can come in contact with.
The plastic water bucket being used by three adult Labradors in the outdoor housing area is severely chewed
around the top rim creating a rough and jagged surface. The bucket is wired to a panel on the front of the enclosure.
The end of the sharp wire is over the top of the water bucket where the dogs can come in contact with it. Correct by:
January 15, 2016.
Within the large white indoor housing facility there are at least 51 enclosures with rusty wire flooring affecting
approximately 101 adult dogs. Correct by: March 13, 2016.
The sharp points could potentially injure the dogs and the rusty surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of
housing facilities are maintained in good repair at all times.
3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
There is an excessive accumulation of food and animal waste under the enclosures in the large white indoor
housing facility containing 101 adult dogs. The standing water puddles in the 'pit' are mixed with animal and food
waste and cover most of the surface under the enclosures. There are several areas where the animal and food
waste has become moldy and white in color. A thin film is visible on the surface of the stagnant water areas.
Unsanitary living conditions exist that could lead to potential disease, contamination or health risks. The potential for
insect and pest infestation exists when feed, animal waste and urine is not removed in a timely manner and
continues to collect under the dogs. The licensee must provide for regular and frequent removal of food waste,
animal waste, water and other fluids for the health and well-being of the dogs.
Exit briefing conducted with the licensee.
