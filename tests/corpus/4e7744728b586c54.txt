ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1650 on
16-Oct-17. I went to the licensee's house. A relative informed me that the licensee was not available. I informed
her I would try back another time.
End of report.
