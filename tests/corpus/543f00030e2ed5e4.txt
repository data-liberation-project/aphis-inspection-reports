ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Alopecia is an issue with many of the Cynomologus macaques housed individually at this facility. One male ( C
69023 ) housed indoors for the winter months was observed to have generalized alopecia.. At time of the
inspection, food enrichment had been given but there were no enrichment devices in his enclosure. The alopecia
may be an indication that the psychological /social needs of this animal are not currently being met. Enrichment
devices such as forage feeding, puzzle devices and even visual barriers may improve the psychological well being
for this animal and others.The facility does have a plan in place to address alopecia and enrichment however there
is inconsistency in the way it is followed in different areas of the facility.The enrichment plan must be followed and
include environmental enrichment for all animals.
