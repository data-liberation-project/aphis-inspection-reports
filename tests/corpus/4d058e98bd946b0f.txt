2.50(a)(2)

Time and method of identification.
There were 10 litters of unweaned puppies who do not have identification. There were cards with the numbers 1, 2, 3, for
the number of puppies but these are repeating numbers for each litter and do not indicate which puppy is represented by
the number. Live puppies or kittens, less than 16 weeks of age, shall be identified to know with certainty each of the
puppies for correct medical treatments and record keeping purposes.

Indoor housing facilities.
The temperature in the whelp room at the beginning of the inspection (approximately 9:45 am) was 47F degrees
(measured by the Kestrel monitor). There were 8 litters of puppies between the ages of 1 week-6 weeks. Each of them
had a heating pad and blankets or towels and the temperature increased to above 50F degrees within minutes of the
heater setting increased. The temperature outdoors was 37F degrees and was less than that overnight (Weather.gov
records). Animals who are not acclimated to temperatures below 50F degrees can become ill and puppies may not thrive
or may become ill.
When dogs or cats are present, the ambient temperature in the facility must not fall below 50 °F (10 °C) for dogs not

acclimated to lower temperatures, for those breeds that cannot tolerate lower temperatures without stress or discomfort
(such as short-haired breeds), and for sick, aged, young, or infirm dogs. The licensee must maintain the temperatures
above 50F and not higher than 85F degrees at all times.

Corrected during the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
