2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
**Members of the public were observed feeding the exhibited animals in the water buffalo, elk and deer areas, however,
no employee or attendant was present at the time.
Failure to have an employee or attendant available during periods of public contact exposes the exhibited animals to
potential safety hazards from resulting from improper contact and/or food sources that may not be appropriate for the
nutritional needs of the animals.
For the safety of the exhibited animals, a responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant must
be present during periods of public contact.

of animal and its nutritional and dietary needs.
To be corrected immediately.
