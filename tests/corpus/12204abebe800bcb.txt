2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
*** In an enclosure housing 4 Shiba Inu, one dog #9215 "Viola" had a fabric muzzle on because she was "picking on
another dog." Although the muzzle allowed her to open her mouth to pant slightly, drink and eat, muzzles should not be
left on dogs unattended. Viola, could cause physical harm to herself trying to remove it and it causes unnecessary
discomfort for a prolonged period of time. This was corrected at the time of the inspection by removing the muzzle and
moving her out of the enclosure to another safe space.

*** A Dachshund # 9224, "Dottie" housed with 4 other dogs had a bark collar around her neck. When she barked the
collar let out a high pitched sound that negatively impacted her and likely the other dogs in the enclosures as it was also
heard by the licensee and inspector. Having a bark collar on a kennel dog for an extended period of time can cause
behavioral stress and cause unnecessary discomfort to the individual dog and others in the kennel as their hearing is
highly sensitive. This collar was removed from the dog during the inspection.
