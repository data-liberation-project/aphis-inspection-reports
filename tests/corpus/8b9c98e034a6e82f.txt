ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult male giraffe had an approximately 4” crack on the lateral aspect of the lateral hoof of the left rear foot.
There was no documentation to indicate that this deficit in the hoof had been observed by facility personnel. A
crack in the hoof of a giraffe can become a serious issue should the crack become infected or further damaged
resulting in an inability to walk.
Two adult female giraffes had excessively overgrown hooves on both front feet. Overgrown hooves when left
uncorrected can potentially lead to foot and joint problems that can cause gait abnormalities. For the comfort and
health of the animals trimming must occur frequently enough to prevent this condition.
A female nyala was observed standing with a hunched posture in the outdoor pasture area. She appeared to have
an adequate body condition however her coat was not smooth similar to the other nyalas in the pasture area. The
front of her body did not coordinate with the rear part of her body when she was walking resulting in a swaying
motion. When she attempted to run down the slope of the pasture her gait was uncoordinated with her front legs
crossing each other as she moved. This instability in her gait caused her to wobble in attempt to regain her balance
without falling over. The licensee stated the nyala was eating well and in good body condition with no change in
her condition since it was first observed on 8/24/16. There is no documentation to indicate that any veterinary
evaluation of this animal has been performed.
All daily observations of problems in animal health need to be communicated to the veterinarian to ensure that an
appropriate diagnosis is made and a treatment plan can be instituted to ensure the health of the animals and the
safety of the public that has contact with the animals. A veterinarian needs to examine the giraffes for their hooves
and nyala for her hunched posture and uncoordinated gait to determine a diagnosis and set up a treatment plan.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. The roof of the building housing the ringtail lemurs, black and white ruffed lemurs and red ruffed lemurs is in need of
repair. The eave portion of the roof to the right of the entrance door is deteriorating. The roof tiles are crumbling on
the edges and the visible wood underneath appears rotted. On the inside of the building in the corresponding part of
the building the ceiling is wet showing that water is leaking through the damaged roof area. In addition, an
approximately two foot section of the roofline appears to be sagging compared the rest of the roofline with a dented
area visible in the slant of the roof just below that section of the roofline. Tree branches are visible resting on the
roof. A roof in need of repair can lead to leakage into the building and may not remain structurally sound. The lemur
housing facility needs to be kept in good repair.
3.76(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The building referred to as the “mouse house” currently houses capuchins (brown tuff and black & white) along with
birds and rodents. Upon entering the building a strong odor of ammonia was noted by the inspectors. This odor
remained strong throughout the entire time the inspectors were in the building. One window was opened about six
inches. At least one floor fan was noted. The facility representative states that windows are opened when cleaning
is done and then closed. The capuchin cages appeared to have just been cleaned. The bird cages and rodent
cages were in need of cleaning. The current level of ventilation is not sufficient to remove the currently high levels of
ammonia odors. Prolonged exposure to excessive ammonia odors can lead to respiratory, eye and mucus
membrane problems for the capuchins. Indoor housing facilities for the capuchins must be sufficiently ventilated at
all times to provide for their health and well-being and to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels and moisture
condensation. Correct by Mar. 14, 2017.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several areas of primary enclosure fencing for the goat, pig, muntjac, fallow deer, bongo, sitatunga, oryx,
and blesbok where trees and vines have grown through the fence and areas that are impossible to inspect because
they have been overgrown by brush. These areas of fencing are not functional in the current condition. The licensee
must ensure that no trees or brush are affecting the structural strength or the ability to inspect the fencing. Failure to
maintain a functional primary enclosure fence does not ensure that all animals can be properly contained and
protected from injury. Correct this by conducting a thorough self-inspection of the all enclosure fencing to ensure
that all areas are functional and comply with written requirements.
***The facility is currently closed for the season so APHIS personnel were unable to determine to adequacy of the
elephant enclosure barriers and the presence/absence of an attendant during periods of public exhibition.***The perimeter fence variance requests are under review.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and another facility representative.
