On Feb 2, 2014 a groundhog was on exhibition as part of groundhog day celebration. During the handling the
groundhog managed to escape from the hands of an untrained person and fall to ground. Medical records showed
no apparent ill effects.
In addition about a week latter in Feb the same groundhog was used as an educational animal in a school when he
managed to escape again from the handler it is unclear if the animal fell or just escaped, subsequently the
groundhog was found deceased on Feb 9.

animal fell as well as the veterinarian was not notified of this incident. even though the animal had managed to
escape and fall during a previous exhibition about a week before, subsequently the animal was found deceased.

made.
