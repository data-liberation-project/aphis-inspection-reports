3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces.
1. Chain link pens are used for the indoor housing of the dogs. One of the horizontal support bars at floor level in
one dog's pen was noted to be rusted along much of the bar's surface. The presence of rust can interfere with the
effectiveness of sanitization as well as affect the structural strength of the pen.
Per this Section of the Regulations, interior surfaces that come in contact with dogs must be free of excessive rust
that can prevent required cleaning and sanitization or that can affect the structural strength of the surfaces.
The condition of the horizontal bar in the dog's pen needs to be addressed for the health of the dog.
Correct by 11/6/15.
