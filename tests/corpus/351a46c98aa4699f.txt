RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The list of animals on hand was not available for review at the time of inspection. If this record cannot be located, it
must be recreated and should include the following information for each animal:
(i) The name and address of the person from whom the animals were purchased or otherwise acquired or the
date of birth if born on the property;
(ii) The USDA license or registration number of the person if he or she is licensed or registered under the Act;
(iii) The vehicle license number and State, and the driver's license number (or photographic identification card
for nondrivers issued by a State) and State of the person, if he or she is not licensed or registered under the Act;
(iv) The name and address of the person to whom an animal was sold or given;
(v) The date of purchase, acquisition, sale, death, or euthanization;
(vi) The species of the animal(s);
Records are important for keeping track of a herd or collection, monitoring for regulated activity, and for herd health
and disease control (traceback).
