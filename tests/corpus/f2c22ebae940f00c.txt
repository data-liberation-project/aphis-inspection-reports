2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. An adult brown and white guinea pig in pen 36 was observed with
both front feet that were moderately swollen. The left front foot had a swollen area approximately 1 inch in size and the
right front foot had a swollen area approximately .75 inches in size in the foot pad area. The skin in the area appeared
pinkish red in color and there was a circular area approximately .25 inches in size on the underside of each pad that was
brownish in color where the skin appeared worn away. The guinea pig was observed to sit with most of its weight on the
back feet and was reluctant to place weight on the front feet. The Program of Veterinary Care did not contain any
instructions on treatment of the condition.
Swollen feet can be painful and if caused by an infection, can worsen and spread to other parts of the body and result in
other health issues. Delays in providing appropriate veterinary care for health conditions can result in worsening of the
condition and potentially spread to other unaffected animals if infectious in nature.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate this animal and determine an appropriate plan
for diagnosis and treatment.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
