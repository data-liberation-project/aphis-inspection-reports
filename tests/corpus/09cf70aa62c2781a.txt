FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
***** At time of inspection the pen constructed for the alpacas consisted of cedar post, top and bottom cedar rails
covered by livestock field fence. In the center of the pen was a partial wall constructed where the wire had been
damaged and trampled to within 18" of the ground and created a potential for injury to the alpacas.
There were several other areas of damage to the wire in the outer walls of the pen which effected the structural
integrity of the enclosure and posed a risk for injury.
Several of the top rails of cedar were broken and no longer structurally sound and effected the overall integrity of
this pen.
All of the items listed above need to be repaired or replaced to prevent injury to the alpacas and to provide the
stuctural integrity to the pen needed to keep the animals contained.
