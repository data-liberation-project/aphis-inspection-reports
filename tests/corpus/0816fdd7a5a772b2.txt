ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The marmost is housed in a room with no other animals and is unable to hear or see other non-human primates.
There is no environmental enrichment plan for the marmoset. A plan for environmental enrichment must be
developed, documented, and followed to promote the psychological well-being of non-human primates. An
environmental enrichment plan must be developed with the attending veterinarian to include provisions to address
the special needs of a single-housed marmoset that does not haave the ability to hear and see other non-human
primates.Correct by Novermber 21, 2014

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The board fencing for the petting zoo animals is excessively worn and portions of the fence are leaning. One
section of the goat/pig/horse pen has a partially broken post. Primary enclosure fencing should be structurally sound
to contain the animals. The board fencing must be repaired as needed or replaced to ensure containment of the
petting zoo animals. Correct by December 30, 2014. NOTE: A maintenance plan has been developed.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The facility is closed at the time of the inspection. Three persons gained entry into the zoo and was able to walk
to
the back of the property before being noticed. The entrance gates, which are part of the perimeter fence, were
open. The inside entry gate to the petting zoo area was shut. The perimeter fence must prevent the entry of
unwanted humans for the protection of the public and animals at all times. Measures must be taken to ensure the
perimeter fence is secure when an attendant is not readily available in any area of the zoo.
3.131(c)
SANITATION. ***The outdoor rug in the kitchen has been recently cleaned. However, the fibers of the carpet are sufficiently worn
that it can no longer be cleaned and sanitized effectively. Surfaces should be cleaned as needed to prevent
excessive soiling and must be sanitizable. The carpet should be replaced to facilitate the cleaning and sanitization
practices in the kitchen area. Corrected: Carpet replaced at the time of inspection.
***A portion of the primary perimeter fence (there is a secondary perimeter fence) for the young tigers is movable.
Fencing should be secured in a manner that ensures it function as primary containment should a tiger escape.
Measures should be taken to ensure the fence is sufficiently secure to facilitate containment of the animals in the
event of an escape. Correct By November 14, 2014
