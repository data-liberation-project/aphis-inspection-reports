ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two fallow deer were observed with extremely long hooves on all four legs. One adult brown La Mancha goat had
overgrown and misshapen hooves on both rear legs. Overgrown hooves can lead to pain, discomfort, lameness,
gait abnormalities and joint/conformation problems. Veterinarian needs to evaluate and trim hooves for the deer
and the La Mancha goat by 7/25/17.
Excessive numbers of horn flies were observed on the cattle. Cattle were exhibiting signs of irritation by stomping,
twitching and excessive tail swishing. The painful bites can lead to skin lesions, infections and disease
transmission. An effective fly control program can lead to reduction of fly numbers and irritation and pain for the
animals. Animals treated during the inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the rabbit area, an open bag of rabbit food was sitting on the ground. Open bags and bags stored on the ground
are susceptible to infestation of vermin and pests resulting in contaminated food supplies which could reduce the
wholesomeness or palatability of the food. This can result in feed refusal or diesease in the rabbits. Food supplies
must be stored off the ground and in containers with tight fitting lids once opened. To be corrected by 7/7/17.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Rabbit enclosure with brown rex and black lion/flop rabbits (2) had excessive amount of fecal material and spilled
food built up in the bottom of the cage. Unsanitary conditions can lead to disease or infestation of pests. Cages
must be cleaned as needed to prevent fecal and debris buildup. Correct by 7/7/17.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One large polyethylene woven collapsible bag (one ton soft tote) containing cracked corn was sitting on the groundwith top open and corn spilling out onto ground. In the shed containing the mother pig and two piglets, multiple
bags of mini-pig feed and other feed bags were sitting on the ground. Improperly stored feed can become infested
with pests or vermin or become wet and spoiled leading to reduced palatability and nutritional value. Animals can
refuse to eat or become ill from eating contaminated or spoiled feed. All feed supplies must be stored off the
ground and in a manner to prevent contamination and spoilage. To be corrected by 7/25/17.

WATERING.
The water tub for the pen of adult La Mancha goats was green and cloudy with a large number of flies and other
insects floating on top. A large amount of green slime was present along sides and bottom of tub. Contaminated
water can be unpalatable and unhealthy for the animals and serve as a breeding ground for insects. All water
containers must be kept clean and sanitary. To be corrected by 7/7/17.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Large amounts of clutter and debris were present in the shed housing the mother pig and two piglets. This can
provide a habitat for vermin to breed and hide and present safety hazards. Animal housing areas should be kept
clear of trash and debris at all times. To be corrected by 8/4/17.
