There is a female Chihuahua (#565) light brindle that has an injury to her left ear. The base of the ear has
approximately a 1/4 inch cut, with a white/yellow discharge, and the surrounding ear has a moderate amount of
cracked, dried blood around the inside and inside surface of the inner ear. There is some swelling around the base
of the ear and near the jaw. There has not been any treatment for this injury, as it had gone un-noticed before the
inspection.
All injuries or illnesses should be treated as soon as noticed in order to prevent a treatable condition from becoming
chronic and to decrease the pain and discomfort to the regulated animal.
The licensee must contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the ear, and treat as soon as
possible.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a female CHI #565 that is a light brindle that has an injury and possible infection of her left ear. There is
dried blood inside and around the ear itself, with a white/yellow substance in a small 1/4 inch cut at the base of the
ear. The owner had not observed this injury until during the inspection, and it appears the injury is at least a few
days old. There has not been treatment until after the inspection when the issue was discovered.
It is imperative that all animals are observed fully on a daily basis in order to find any health issues that may occur,
in order to provide treatment in a timely manner. In this way there is as little discomfort to the animal as possible.
The owner must increase their daily monitoring of the regulated animals and look at each animal to make sure thereare no injuries or illnesses affecting them.
