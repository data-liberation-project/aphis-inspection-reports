FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Many animal enclosures were noted to be in need of maintenance. These include:
***Damaged kick-ins (overhangs). Kick-ins are an important part of the enclosure fence that keep animals from
climbing out and escaping. All kick-ins must be maintained in good condition to ensure the animals can be securely
contained.
***Cougar enclosure (cid:19)has an approximately 12'(cid:25) long part of the kick-in that is damaged and instead of protruding
into the enclosure, it is bent downwards. Red fox enclosure (cid:19)has an approximately 15'(cid:25) long part of the kick-in that is
bent over and part of it is no longer connected to the support bars. Also, a significant amount of ground wire is
exposed along the bottom of the west side of the enclosure fence line due to erosion and shifting of the ground.

***J hooks above ground in animal enclosures. The J hooks are used to secure the ground line that keeps the
animals from digging out. These hooks are protruding anywhere from 6(cid:29)" to 12"(cid:29) above the ground. An animal can
easily be injured by these protrusions by catching or trapping a paw. The cougar, coyote, bear and red fox
enclosures have numerous exposed J hooks. All J hooks must be placed below the ground line or removed.

***Many ground lines (the chain link buried under the ground to keep animals from digging out) were exposed.
Exposure in these enclosures ranged from 2'(cid:25) to more than 15(cid:25)'. Injury could occur if an animal got a paw trapped
or caught in the ground line. The cougar, bobcat and coyote enclosures have exposed ground line. All ground lines
should be covered to prevent animal injury.

***An enclosure containing one adult male black bear does not have a hot wire that is working. The hot wire in the
enclosure was hanging and not connected to the fencing around the enclosure. The lack of hot wire may
compromise the ability of the enclosure to maintain the animals, allowing them to escape. A system in which the hot
wire can be maintained and checked for function needs to be established.

***The guide wire at the top of the fencing in the bobcat enclosure was attached with black zip ties and loosely
wrapped around posts supporting the fence.

***Cracked flooring in enclosure. The cement flooring in the bear shift area has multiple cracks resulting in anuneven surface causing difficulty when opening the doors to the caging and outside area. The flooring and walls
were wet due to flooding. Water was seen dripping from inside the electrical breaker resulting in an electrical short
causing damage to the lighting. Cracked and uneven surfaces poses a potential risk to the animal and doesn't
allow for proper cleaning/sanitation of flooring.
