2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
***Based upon information received in a complaint and obtained from the Heartfelt Hedgehogs website and social
media pages, hedgehogs are being bred and sold without a USDA license. The owner of Heartfelt Hedgehogs was
previously licensed but failed to renew in 2014. On September 6, 2017, I spoke with the owner of Heartfelt
Hedgehogs, who verified that the business has remained active and regulated activity was being conducted at a
new location.
Any person operating as a commercial breeder of exotics must obtain a USDA license and be subject to inspection
by an APHIS official. Heartfelt Hedgehogs must be licensed for its current business activity in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act.
CONDUCTING REGULATED ACTIVITY WITHOUT A VALID USDA LICENSE IS A VIOLATION OF THE ANIMAL
WELFARE ACT.
