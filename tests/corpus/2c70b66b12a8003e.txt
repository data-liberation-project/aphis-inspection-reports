3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One of the outdoor shelter structures for three dogs housed in the outdoor enclosure since yesterday does not have
adequate wind and rain break at the entrance. Failure to provide a barrier from the elements in the form of a wind
and rain break can result in a dog that becomes wet and uncomfortable. In some weather, a dog that does not have
a barrier from the elements is unable to maintain a safe body temperature. All dogs must be provided with shelter
from the elements which includes wind and rain breaks at the entrance to shelter structures. This was corrected at
the time of inspection when the dogs were removed from an outdoor enclosure.
3.4(b)(4) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is no bedding in the shelter structures provided to three dogs that have been housed in an outdoor enclosure
since yesterday. The ambient temperature recorded on the inspector(cid:25)'s Kestral during the inspection was 37.4
degrees F. When the licensee's zip code was entered into the weather.gov website, the lowest temperature
recorded for last night was 32 degrees F. Lack of bedding in cold weather can result in dogs that cannot maintain a
safe body temperature. The licensee must provide clean, dry bedding material in the ambient temperature is below
50 degrees F and additional bedding when the temperature is below 35 degrees F. These dogs were moved to a
sheltered enclosure during the inspection. To be corrected from this point forward.
3.6(a)(2)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One enclosure housing a female and her puppies had carpet square heavily soiled with excreta provided as
bedding. This carpet square was directly in front of the food and water receptacles. Soiled surfaces that come into
contact with the dogs can play a role in disease transmission and can cause the animals to become soiled. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the dogs and cats be readily cleaned and sanitized in
accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart, or be replaceable when worn or soiled. To be corrected by 7 January
2016.The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives in attendance.
