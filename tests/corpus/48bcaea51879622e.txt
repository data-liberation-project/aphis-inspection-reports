2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
On November 4, 2022, a male macaque (#18) escaped from his primary enclosure and was bit by another macaque.
According to the animal care technician, the macaque was allowed access to all four units of the caging for additional
enrichment. The animal care technician did not adequately secure the door, allowing the macaque to escape. According
to records, the macaque (#18) stuck his hand into the cage of another macaque (#17) and attempted to grab macaque
#17 by the hand. Macaque #17, bit macaque #18 resulting in a laceration on the right forearm.
The animal care technician was able to safely return macaque #18 to his enclosure. The Clinical Veterinarian and
Veterinary Technician were immediately contacted. The macaque #18 was sedated and assessed. While macaque #18
was under anesthesia the laceration was repaired by the Clinical Veterinarian. The macaque received adequate
veterinary care, which included pain medication and antibiotics. The clinical veterinary staff monitored and managed the
laceration to recovery.
Handling of all animals shall be done expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
This was corrected before the time of inspection through requiring that each cage door is secured by either placing two
pins and a carabiner or placing two pins and a lock.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
