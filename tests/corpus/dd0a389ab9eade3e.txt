2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 307 adult and 139 newborns were counted
during this inspection. Inventory numbers for the last 3 months were only being recorded once a month on the side of the
rack. Failure to maintain records on the number of adults, weanlings, newborns, and guinea pigs that died makes it
difficult to assess the health of the caviary and to track additions and losses. The licensee must ensure that records are
maintained for the number of guinea pigs held, owned, born, or died. Correct by April 28, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
