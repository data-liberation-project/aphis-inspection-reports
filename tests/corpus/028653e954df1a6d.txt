All lemurs have shelter from the sun, wind and rain however there are no heaters in the shelters.. Heaters are
available for the lemurs but have not yet been placed in shelters. Night time temperatures are predicted for the
lower 40's /upper 30's . Lemurs are a species that may experience discomfort and health issues such as frost bite
when temperatures fall into this range and lower. The shelter must safely provide heat to the non human primates
to prevent the ambient temperatures from falling below 45 degrees unless directed by the attending veterinarian to
prevent discomfort. CORRECT BY : From This Date Forward

water. The bowl was dry. Licensee stated these animals frequently knock over the water bowl but are offered water
2 - 3 times per day . Water was provided to these animals at inspectors request and they both were observed
drinking for several minutes. Frequent access to water is necessary for the health and well being of the animals. A
method must be developed to prevent the animals from knocking the water bowl over so that water can be provided
for the health and comfort of these animals. CORRECT : From This Date Forward
