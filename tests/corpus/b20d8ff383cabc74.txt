ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Section 3.81 Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being: The facility written plan for
environment enrichment for its non-human primates has not been updated to reflect the current social groupings,
environmental enrichment provided, and the birth (infant) Patas monkey with its mother and family group.

Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to
promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate journals or reference guides, and as directed by the
attending veterinarian. This plan must be available to APHIS upon request and at a minimum, address each of the
following: social grouping, environment enrichment, special considerations, restraint devices, and exemptions
described in Section 3.81 of the Animal Welfare Regulations. Correct by updating the facility written plan for
environment enrichment for the non-human primates to reflect current conditions and approval by the attending
veterinarian. Correct by August 10, 2016.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127 (c) Drainage: The area in front of the shelter for the camel has rain water and feces
accumulating/pooling in the bottom of the two holes/low areas in the dirt/ground. The facility escort informed the
APHIS official that the male camel likes to dance/display in this area by the shelter causing dirt to erode away
leaving the ground uneven. The pooling water and feces may attract insects and cause odors. The ground in front
of the shelter must have adequate drainage to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by leveling the ground in this
area to allow adequate drainage. Correct by July 6, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility vice president.
