BEAR/SERVAL BUILDING:
An approximately 10 inch long section of the ceiling, above the enclosure adjacent to the food prep area, has
missing paint. The missing paint, again, exposes the unsealed drywall due to the moisture in the building. The
damaged area of the ceiling must be repaired and a more suitable method to remove excess water must be
implemented to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
