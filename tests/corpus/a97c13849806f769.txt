2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:45 on
08/11/2016.
Attempts to contact the licensee included knocking on all doors of the house, calling the home phone and leaving a
message, and calling the licensee at his office. The office manager indicated that he was out of the office at that
time, but a voicemail was left in the event he returned promptly thereafter.
Without a responsible adult, the inspection process cannot be conducted. The licensee must ensure that a
responsible and knowledgeable adult will be available during his optimal hours for inspection to accompany AC
inspectors.
Correct from this time forward.
