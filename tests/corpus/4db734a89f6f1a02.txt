2.5(d) REPEAT
DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
- The drive through area of the park is currently open for visitors, but is not an approved site. Site 002 (drive
through site) is not a valid site and must be in complete compliance with all aspects of the Animal Welfare Act prior
to being used for regulated activity.
2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The information for "Handling Dangerous Animals" has not been completed and sent to the regional office. The
qualifications of the employees and addressing the other issues listed on the form are of utmost importance. The
drive through section of the park contains potentially dangerous animals, such as a rhinoceros and a tiger, which
were not on the original license. Individuals lacking knowledge and experience with dangerous animals might
negatively impact the health and welfare of the animal through improper husbandry. The licensee must provide the
regional office with written documentation regarding the experience and knowledge of the individuals who handle
these animals. This information must be submitted and approved by the Western Regional Office before this site
can be approved for regulated activity.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- At the time of inspection the drive through area of the park had members of the public driving their cars through
and feeding animal feed from paper Pepsi cups that are available for purchase at the gift shop. There were no park
employees present during this public/animal interaction. Empty Pepsi cups were noted scattered on the ground
throughout the park. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present
at all times during periods of public contact.
3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The border fence for the drive through area is leaning sharply in several areas. Fencing in this condition is not
secure, nor is it safe for the enclosed animals.
- The water container for Tank has loose wires protruding from the nearby fence and out over the bucket. This is a
potential source of injury any time the rhino attempts to drink from this bucket. The facility must secure or remove
this wire.
- The inside portion of the kangaroo enclosure has a plywood wall panel that is approximately 1/4 inch thick and 8
feet long that is pulled back a foot to 18 inches from the studs exposing insulation and sharp points. The opposite
wall on the inside portion of the kangaroo enclosure has a metal panel that is secured at the top but not on the sides
or bottom. This metal panel has sharp points and is curling away from the wall on the horizontal portions. These
areas allow possible injury or entrapment of the enclosed animals. The facility must secure and repair these areas
to prevent injury to the enclosed animal.
- The outside area of the kangaroo enclosure has an unsecured metal panel with sharp points leaning on the
medical building. This poses a risk of limb injury or entrapment of the enclosed animal. The facility removed this
metal panel during the inspection.
- In the first section of the drive through park there is a pile of tin roofing material on the ground. This tin has sharp
points and edges which is a potential injury to the enclosed animals. The facility must remove or secure this tin
roofing material to protect the enclosed animals.
- In the Serengeti area of the park there is a wall in the back shelter that is leaning and has many sharp points. The
wall could fall and injure the enclosed animals. The facility must secure the wall and remove the sharp points to
protect the enclosed animals.
- Just inside the front cattle guard, there is a section of empty enclosures with an approximate two foot wide fenced
alley way around these enclosures. This alley way use to be the public barrier when animals were in these
enclosures. These enclosures have metal angle brackets and metal posts leaning in this alley way making it
dangerous for the enclosed animals to navigate through this alley way. The alley way is open on each end and
animals in the front section of the park have free access to this alley way. This a potential source of injury. The
alley way must be removed or closed off and maintained in good condition to protect the enclosed animals in the
front section of the park.3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- The east side of the giraffe enclosure did not have any perimeter fencing or barrier outside of the enclosure fence
itself. There is a house and other buildings in this area, very close to the giraffe enclosure. The facility
representative stated it was not their property. Without a proper perimeter fence, unauthorized members of the
public could freely reach the giraffe enclosure fencing. A perimeter fence must be constructed here and kept intact,
both to prevent unauthorized access and to serve as a secondary containment for the animal.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative and two APHIS VMOs.
