INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC reported to the Institutional Official once in 2019, in December 2019, and the report was not signed by a
majority of the IACUC members. Reporting to the institutional official ensures that the committee informs the
Institutional Official of any program deficiencies, identifies facility needs, and, if present, animal welfare issues, as
well as establishing a plan for correction of deficiencies. Signature by the majority of the committee ensures that the
IACUC has reviewed the animal care program and any required improvements. Reports to the IO are required to
be updated at least every six months upon completion of the semi-annual program review.
Correct by: the time of the next semi annual report to the IO.
