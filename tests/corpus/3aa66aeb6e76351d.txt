ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:40 a.m. on
05-DEC-17.
I arrived at the facility at 9:40 a.m. and knocked on the door, there was no answer. I called the licensee and was
able to make contact with her. She stated that she was out of town for work and would not be able to meet with me
today to perform the inspection.
