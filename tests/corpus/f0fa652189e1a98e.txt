2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is incomplete. Section 1 of APHIS form 7002 has not been
completely filled out. The PVC is a written agreement between the exhibitor and the attending veterinarian
establishing standards of care for the animals. Failure to have a complete PVC could jeopardize the health and
well-being of the animals. The facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals at
the facility and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
To be corrected by 8/25/15.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The licensee did not have complete acquisition records. For several regulated animals, the address of the person
from whom the animals were purchased or acquired from was missing. Additionally, the vehicle's license number
and state and the driver's license number and state were also missing for several animals. Records containing the
required information for animals acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring born on premise,
are necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care
and use. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition of all animals that fully and correctly
discloses the required information.
To be corrected by 8/25/15.
3.26(a)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
***The ambient temperature around the hamsters read 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit on the Veterinary Medical Officer's
Kestrel device. Animals that are maintained at inappropriate temperatures can lead to medical conditions including
heat stress, dehydration and death. Indoor facilities should be adequately heated and cooled to ensure the ambient
temperature shall not be allowed to fall below 60 degree F, nor to exceed 85 degree F.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The metal water bottle holders in several enclosures (6 hamster and 9 gerbil enclosures) were rusted and had
jagged, sharp points. The sharp points are an injury risk to the animals within the enclosure. Additionally, the
holders are no longer impervious to moisture due to excessive rusting which prevents proper sanitization. A system
should be in place to ensure primary enclosures, including accessories, are maintained in good repair to protect the
animals and shall be constructed of smooth material that's substantially impervious to liquids and moisture.
To be corrected by 8/25/15.
3.28(c)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The interior height of the primary enclosures housing dwarf hamsters (weanlings and breeding groups) is 5
inches and does not meet the requirements of at least 6 inches. Insufficient interior height of the primary enclosure
does not allow the animals to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. A system
should be in place and maintained to ensure this requirement is met.
To be corrected by 9/1/15.
3.28(c)(2)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The facility is currently housing nursing female hamsters in the same primary enclosure with other hamsters. In 3
enclosures, the Veterinary Medical Officer (VMO) noted 1 male hamster with 2 nursing females and their offspring
of varying ages. In several other enclosures, the VMO noted 1 male with 1 nursing female and her offspring.
Overcrowding of pregnant and nursing female hamsters can increase stress to the dam and result in increased
rates of cannibalism of the offspring and fighting. A system should be in place to ensure nursing female hamsters
with her litter shall be housed in an enclosure that contains no other hamsters and provides the required amount of
floor space.
To be corrected by 9/1/15.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
***Several racks of animals had an accumulation of materials (additional enclosures, enclosure tops, water bottles,
etc) on top of them. The materials had a build up of debris (dust, cobwebs) on them which can fall into the
enclosures below housing regulated animals. Additionally, the warehouse housing regulated animals has an
excessive accumulation of materials (racks, enclosures, fish tanks, personal items, etc) which can allow for areas to
harbor pests, overcrowd the facility impeding husbandry practices and decrease air ventilation. The premises shall
be kept clean, in good repair and remain free of accumulations of trash. To be corrected by 8/25/15.
3.37(a)
PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
***The transport vehicle used for transporting regulated animals is in need of repair/replacement. The vehicle's
headliner is torn in several places with strands of cloth material hanging down in the cargo area. This material may
fall into enclosures posing a health hazard to the animals due to ingestion. The animal cargo space of primary
conveyances shall be designed and constructed to protect the health, and ensure the safety and comfort of the live
guinea pigs and hamsters at all times.
To be corrected by 8/25/15.
***Inspection was conducted with husbandry manager along with 2 IES representatives.
***Exit briefing was conducted on 8/18/15 with facility representative.
