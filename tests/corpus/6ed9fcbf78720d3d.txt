2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(1) Veterinary care: The facility written program of veterinary care (PVC) was not available for review
during this inspection. The licensee informed the APHIS official that the PVC was left with the attending
veterinarian to review and update. The written PVC includes the preventive health care instructions from the
veterinarian for the facility animals and is reviewed during inspections to see if the licensee is following the
instructions for the health care of the animals. A copy of the PVC must be available at the facility for review by
APHIS officials and for use by the licensee. Correct by September 29, 2015.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The far shelter for the large pasture enclosure housing nine goats, seven
sheep and domestic equine had the metal floor strip at the entrance coming up away from the floor. There were
small holes in the wood floor at the entrance where the wood had deteriorated. The animals may get a hoof caught
on the detaching metal strip or step into a hole in the wood floor and become injured. Once the APHIS official
identified the condition of the shelter to the licensee, the licensee repaired the floor of the shelter. Facilities must be
constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. Housing facilities must
be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Corrected during the
inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
