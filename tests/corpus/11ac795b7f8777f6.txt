Facilities, general.
Waste disposal. The room adjacent to the guinea pig room used for emptying enclosure trays, dead animals, and waste
was filthy. A wheel barrow was full of dirty bedding, sawdust, and dead guinea pigs. This room had sawdust, hay, dirt,
empty boxes, feed bags, bale twine, wood scraps, PVC pipes, plastic barrels, lids, clutter and junk on floor and against
the walls. The waste disposal area needs to be cleaned and maintained to support good animal husbandry and health.
Correct by ensuring the waste disposal area is operated and maintained so that animal waste, food waste, bedding, dead
animals, and debris are properly disposed of and operated to minimize vermin infestations, odors, and disease hazards.
