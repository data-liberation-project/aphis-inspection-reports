ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier (0A01242932) had an approximately 4 inch diameter raw skin area on the
rear, just left of the rectum. The dog was observed repeatedly licking this area and occasionally favoring the left
rear leg. The skin in this area was moist, reddened with spots of bright red and black throughout the raw area, and
yellow and black in the middle of the round raw area. There was also a a reddish-yellow discharge from the area.
The last veterinary visit on June 6 the veterinarian stated the area was a tumor and the licensee wished to breed
him to 2 more females before bringing him back to address the problem. The licensee stated, since the last
veterinary visit about 4 months ago, while waiting to have this dog breed 2 females, they have treated the dog with
Corona cream and/or Vetericyn spray when area looked worse or the dog acted like the area was bothering him, but
he would just lick it off. Although there is no documentation of this treatment. Treatment for this dog started March
13, 2016, at that time medical records stated the area was a open knot half the size of a golf ball. The last
documentation for medical treatment was on June 6, 2016. The treating veterinarian was presented a current
picture of this dog and did say this area has increased in size and needs attention. The condition of this dog could
indicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may be uncomfortable. The licensee must
have this dog seen by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an
appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it
available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care
at all times.
The exit interview was done on 10/3/2016 and the licensee was verbally told this was a direct NCI and this dog
needed to be seen by a veterinarian by close of business on 10/4/2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Chad Proctor ACI, and MDA inspector.
