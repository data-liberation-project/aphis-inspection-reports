FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125 (a) Structural Strength. The fencing along the left side of the lockout for the bobcat named "Spirit" has wires
that are bent outward with sharp edges protruding towards the animal. The bent wire with the sharp edges could
potentially cause an injury to the animal. Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound and
in good repair to protect the animals from injuries.
