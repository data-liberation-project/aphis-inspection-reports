Contingency planning.
A contingency plan has not yet been developed at this facility. Dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers
must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation,
housing, and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster (one which could reasonably be anticipated
and expected to be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the animals in their possession). A plan must be
developed documented and followed and employees trained on the plan. CORRECT BY : 2/24/2023

Sanitation.
The studio building housing the 35 rabbits is cluttered with an accumulation of animal caging, bedding, bags stored in
plastic bins and other supplies not used in the daily care of the animals on top of the rabbit cages. Accumulation of
supplies near animal enclosures makes proper cleaning of the animal room difficult and is also an area where pests may
hide. Buildings must be kept clean and in order to facilitate husbandry practices. CORRECT BY : 1/31/2023

Facilities, general.


In the studio building housing the 12 hedgehogs there is an open bag of hedgehog pellets directly on the floor. An open
bag of feed may allow contamination by vermin or debris. All supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner
that protects such supplies against deterioration and contamination by vermin. CORRECT BY: 1/31/2023
