FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The ceiling contained multiple areas where the paint is flaking off revealing the bare wood underneath. These
surfaces are not impervious to water and cannot be effectively sanitized. Sanitization of interior building surfaces is
essential to control diseases and to control odors and pests. These surfaces must be sealed so that they are
impervious to water.

3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The lower level of the facility contained several primary enclosure cages that had areas of wire flooring in the
corners that was sagging and becoming deteriorated. A great number of the enclosures on the lower level had
large amounts of urine scale on the wire walls forming the back of the enclosure. This scale had rusted and
deteriorated the wire on many of the cages. The wire is lacking in structural integrity and was broken in several
places. Wire points were observed protruding into several of the enclosures. Rusting and broken wire was located
below leaky lixits on a few of the cages in the lower level. Urine scale must be removed and leaky lixits repaired
and then this wire must be evaluated and repaired or replaced if needed in order to prevent possible injury to the
rabbits caused by failure of this wire. This caging must be repaired or replaced in order to prevent possible animal
injury leading to unnecessary suffering or euthanasia of rabbits.
3.54(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The lower level contained a cage located on a top row with a water lixit that was continuously dripping. This water
was splashing and running down the sides of the cages below it. The cage on the bottom row was very rusty where
this water was splashing on it indicating to me that this problem had been going on for some time. The food
receptacle was being splashed and food inside the receptacle was contaminated with this dirty water. This presents
a disease hazard for the animals ingesting this feed. This lixit needs to be repaired to prevent the rabbits from
consuming feed tainted with this water which has become contaminated with feces while running and splashingdown the sides of the cages above it.
3.54(b)
FEEDING.
The lower level had several feeders in use that were rusted to a point where they could no longer be effectively
cleaned and sanitized. These feeders must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. It is essential that these
feeders be effectively cleaned and sanitized in order to prevent the spread of disease and control odors which
become a problem when items cannot be cleaned and sanitized thoroughly.

3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The lower level contained numerous primary rabbit enclosures with an excessive buildup of urine scale, fecal
material and debris on the wire of the back wall of the enclosure. This buildup needs to be removed more
frequently to control disease and odors in the facility. This material can harbor infectious agents capable of causing
disease. It is not possible to effectively sanitize these enclosures when this buildup of urine scale and debris is
present on them. Clean these enclosures. Clean them as often as needed to prevent this buildup of urine scale,
fecal material and debris.
3.56(b)(1)
SANITATION.
Multiple primary enclosures have areas of wire which has rusted to a degree that it can no longer be effectively
cleaned and sanitized. These cages must be sanitized at least once every 30 days. It is essential that these cages
be effectively cleaned and sanitized in order to prevent the spread of disease and control odors which become a
problem when items cannot be cleaned and sanitized thoroughly.

3.56(c)
SANITATION.
Many of the support columns for the caging located in the lower section of the facility were covered with a thick crust
of grime and brown sludge like material. This can lead to disease and odor control issues and pest control
problems. These columns must be cleaned.

EMPLOYEES.
The site manager informed the inspector that several employees have left the facility recently and the facility is
currently interviewing replacements. The nature of the citations at the facility on this inspection indicates that more
employees are desperately needed. Wire has been purchased and is on hand to make cage floor repairs but this
has not yet been accomplished. Routine cleaning tasks such as removing urine scale and cleaning cage support
columns are being neglected. At the time of inspection the rabbits appeared to be in good health but if conditions
continue to deteriorate this may lead to possible animal injury and sickness resulting in unnecessary animal
suffering. It is essential that more employees be hired or animal numbers reduced.
