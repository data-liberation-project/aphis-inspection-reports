3.130 Direct Repeat

Watering.
One African crested porcupine enclosure, housing one porcupine, did not have any drinking water. When the licensee
offered the porcupine water, it drank excessively for a minimum of two minutes. The lack of water can cause dehydration,
distress, and even death. This was corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
