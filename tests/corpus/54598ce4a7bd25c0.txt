2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) available for review at the time of inspection. In order to
ensure problems of animal health are addressed adequately, there needs to be a written PVC. The written PVC
shall include the species being utilized or sold in regulated activities, preventative care, health problems that they
may have and how these will be addressed by the licensee and the Attending Veterinarian.
Ensure that the formal arrangement with the Attending Veterinarian includes a detailed written Program of
Veterinary Care and is made available for review during the inspection process.
