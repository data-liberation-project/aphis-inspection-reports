FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(c) Drainage. The outdoor enclosure housing two domestic pigs is saturated with water that is not properly
draining. There are at least two water puddles and the entire outside portion of the enclosure is a muddy
consistency. There are no dry areas for the animals to get out of the mud. The water source is surrounded by mud
that the pigs sink into about half-way up their legs. There is the potential for foot problems and disease.
A suitable method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.TO BE CORRECTED BY: JULY 13, 2015

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(d) Perimeter Fence. Along the perimeter fence to the left of the main entrance to the facility there are limbs
hanging over the top edge against the barbed wire portion. There are multiple points of contact from trees, bushes,
and vines. The over-hanging limbs allow for animals to enter or exit the facility unrestricted.
The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and function as a
secondary containment system.

3.129(a)
FEEDING.
(a) In the enclosure housing two domestic pigs the rubber pan that was being used as a food dish had standing
water and hay debris that was soaked. Water can potentially reduce the nutritive value of the food and lead to
contamination.
In the enclosure housing two African Crested Porcupines the food is being fed directly on the ground with no other
measures to prevent contamination. Contaminated food can potentially cause disease and reduce palatability.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and be sufficient in quantity and nutritive
value.
