ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility doesn't have an approved and documented plan for the environmental enhancement of the lemur. The
lemur does have enrichment in the form of toys within its enclosure. However, there must be a documented plan
addressing the various aspects of environmental enhancement that is approved by the facility's veterinarian.
Environmental enhancement is crucial to enriching non-human primates.
Document a plan for the environmental enhancement of the lemur. Assure that it is approved by the facility's
veterinarian.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The Patagonian cavy enclosure continues to lack a perimeter fence. The enclosure now houses a pair of
Patagonian cavies and has new fencing against and adjacent to the enclosure. The new fencing is only
approximately four feet tall and doesn't extend around the entire enclosure. Perimeter fences prevent unauthorized
persons and animals from contacting the animal(s) contained within, Perimeter fences also provide a secondary
containment system if the animal(s) escape.
A perimeter fence measuring at least six feet in height and at least three feet from the enclosure must be erected.
Note: Fencing panels were placed around the enclosure between the time of inspection and the exit briefing. The
panels are not yet secured to prevent the fence from moving.

SANITATION. 1. Excessive, compacted feces were present on the ground of the adult wallaby enclosure during the time of
inspection. The wallaby was housed in a large collapsible dog crate with a removable plastic floor. At least 1/3 of
the floor had compacted feces on it.

woodchuck was housed in a collapsible dog crate with a removable plastic floor. At least 1/4 of the floor had feces
on it. Additionally, Several flies were observed inside of the enclosure, on the feces, and on the groundhog.

occurred between the time of inspection and the exit briefing.
