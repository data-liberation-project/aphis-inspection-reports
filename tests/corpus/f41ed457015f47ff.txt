2.131(d)(3)

Handling of animals.
The facility demonstrated and discussed handling of the skunk and wolves for exhibition with the public, and discussed
their training methods and safety precautions which did not meet the expectations of direct control in some
circumstances. During some previous exhibitions, members of the public were allowed to hold the leash or pat an
unleashed wolf with handlers standing several feet away, at a distance that may be too far to allow for timely intervention
in case of emergency. Interaction of wild and potentially dangerous animals such as wolves with the untrained public, if
not under direct control of an experienced handler, risks the welfare of the animal due to the unpredictability of the
interactions. The facility must ensure that dangerous animals are under the direct control and supervision of a
knowledgeable and experienced animal handler. The facility shall ensure animals are directly controlled during public
exhibition.

An immediate plan for direct control was instituted and will be used from August 23, 2021 moving forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives on August 23, 2021.
