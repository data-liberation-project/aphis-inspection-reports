FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence in the Fallow Deer enclosure had a gap between the ground and the bottom of the fence. This
gap is large enough that the smaller Fallow Deer could escape, or that another animals could enter the exhibit. This
fence-line acts as the primary enclosure fence as well as the perimeter fence. The fence must be constructed so
that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment
system for the animals in the facility.

On today's inspection, the inside of the Fallow Deer, Nialgi, Lions and Tiger water receptacles were covered in
algae and debris. The facility representative stated that the water receptacles was due to be cleaned. He stated that
the receptacles is cleaned on a weekly schedule. However; it had not been cleaned prior to today(cid:25)s inspection. A
facility employee took out a scrub brush and scrubbed the water receptacles while the inspector was at the facilitycompleting the inspection. All water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized using commonly accepted husband
standards as often as necessary to prevent organic growth. A cleaner and a sanitizer must be used during the
cleaning process. In addition, potable water must be made available as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animals. Correct this by ensuring all water and receptacles are maintained in a clean and sanitary
condition.
