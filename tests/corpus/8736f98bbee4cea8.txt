2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The medical record of dog #4575, an adult brown and white hound mix, age unknown, contains documentation
dated November 9, 2011 that the teeth need to be cleaned because of heavy tartar. This dog is still housed at the
facility and has not had any dental procedures performed.
During this inspection this dog's teeth were observed to have a brown to tannish hard material covering the surface
of the upper molars and upper canines on both sides of the mouth. The gums were reddened adjacent to the
affected teeth. The gums above the canine teeth were pulled up and away.These signs are consistent with dental
disease which can be painful and lead to systemic health problems.
This same dog was observed continuously circling to the right at a fast pace. The circling continued at a slower
pace when the dog was unaware of being observed. The circling behavior was documented on November 28, 2012
during a behavior assessment of the dog. Management of this behavior consisted of extra socialization which has
since been discontinued. It is not documented whether the treatment altered the behavior. This behavior can have
physical and/or psychological causes.
The facility must establish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes prevention,
identification and treatment of diagnosed diseases.This dog should be examined by a veterinarian to determine
accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the described symptoms. Follow up care as directed by the
veterinarian should be documented.
