ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Veterinary treatment records for an adult, female Mountain tapir named “Carlotta” indicate that the treatment plan
created by the attending veterinarian was not being properly followed. The treatment plan states that the drug
Famotidine is to be given orally to the tapir “twice a day (bid) for 10 days.” The treatments were logged starting on
October 26, 2017. The “Staff treatment instructions and administration compliance worksheet” indicates that
Carlotta received her medication only once on October 31 and did not receive her medication at all on October 29.
In the notes section on this form, zoo staff wrote “forgot.” Zoo staff verbally informed APHIS inspector that they
forgot to offer the medication to the tapir on those days. Injuries and diseases that are not treated properly (as
directed by a veterinarian) may be painful and can lead to prolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care
problems. Any change by the zoo staff to prescribed treatments should be discussed with and approved by the
facility veterinarians. When a veterinary treatment plan is not followed by zoo staff, it reduces the veterinarian's
ability to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care.
The facility shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

To be corrected from this date forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Four Black-footed ferrets were administered the expired medication, "ponazuril", on October 31, 2017. The
expiration date on the tube of "ponazuril (Marquis)" was June 2017. A facility employee informed APHIS inspectors
that the medication was taken from this tube and then diluted with water and placed into a different bottle, before
being given to the animals. This bottle containing the “1 part ponazuril to 2 parts water” had a label with the
expiration date of June 2017. The use of expired medications is not considered to be a safe or appropriate method
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed. The
animals may experience pain and distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side
effects. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent,control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
A system to identify and remove expired medical supplies shall be developed and implemented by November 9,
2017.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The barrier/wall around the outdoor enclosure for the two North American porcupine does not preclude the public
from reaching down into the enclosure and being able to touch the animals. Unattended public contact does not
ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Sufficient public barriers must be in place to protect the animals
and for the safety of public.
On the right side next to the front door inside the monkey pavilion building is a branch and rope hanging down. The
two Hoffmann's two-toed sloths have access to this area and can climb down. The public is able to reach up and
could come into contact with the animals. Unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with
these animals. Sufficient space and/or public barriers must be in place to protect the animals and for the safety of
public.
Ensure that during periods of public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between
the animals and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In Monkey Pavilion, the freezer storing food for the nonhuman primates was dirty and food was stored in a manner
that did not protect is from spoilage and/or contamination. There was a build-up of food material on the interior
surfaces of the freezer and shelf on the freezer door. Several of the containers containing food in the freezer were
uncovered, and ice crystals had accumulated on the food. There were several cut pieces of oranges which were
uncovered and in contact with the dirty freezer door shelf. The food storage area must be kept clean to ensure the
animals are fed palatable, wholesome, uncontaminated food.
Supplies of food and bedding for non-human primates must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from
spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. Food requiring refrigeration must be stored accordingly, and all
food must be stored in a manner that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. Open food and
bedding supplies must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination.To be corrected by: November 9, 2017

The peeling/chipping paint and holes in the walls expose unsealed surfaces, which cannot be adequately cleaned or
sanitized. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized allow excreta, food waste, and other debris to
accumulate on the surfaces, posing a risk to the health of the animals.
Primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must be constructed and maintained so that surfaces in contact with the
animals can be readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced when worn or soiled. A system of timely identification,
facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
