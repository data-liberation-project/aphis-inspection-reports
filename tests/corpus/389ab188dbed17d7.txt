SANITATION.
During this inspection it was noted that this facility acquired a new, but old, refrigerator. Although this refrigerator is
in working condition the door and sides are rusty and have missing paint. Due to the fact that this appliance is in the
food prep / kitchen area it needs to be able to be cleaned in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
