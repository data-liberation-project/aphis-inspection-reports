2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility does not have an attending veterinarian or written program of veterinary care. Without an attending
veterinarian and written program of veterinary care to guide the facility in the care of the animals, the health and
well-being of the animals could be at risk due to improper care. The facility shall employ an attending veterinarian
under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal
arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
