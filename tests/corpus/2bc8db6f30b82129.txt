** There was a wood beam with pointy screws sticking out of the ends of it. It was lying in the primary enclosure with
the pigs and llamas near the water bucket. The animals could potentially injure themselves if they step on the
screws.The primary enclosure shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain
the animals. The wood beam was removed and therefore corrected before the exit interview.
The exit interview was conducted with the Acting Director.
