Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female 9 month old Husky (Astrid m/c# 9002150040) with 2 pups was very thin. Her vertebrae were easily seen and
shoulders and hip were easily palpated. The owners have been feeding her free choice food and eggs daily. There was
no consultation with a veterinarian to establish a diagnosis or to confirm that this was the correct treatment for this dog.
Poor body condition can be the result of parasites, inadequate nutrition, or an underlying medical condition. Astrid must
be evaluated by a veterinarian within 2 days of this inspection, to know with certainty the problem and the correct
treatment. Documentation of the evaluation, recommended treatment and delivered treatments must be available to
APHIS officials.

Handling of animals.
In the whelp building, the temperature was noted to be 95.6 Degrees F, as measured by the Kestrel monitor. at
approximately 2:15 pm. There were 3 fans operating but the puppies were exhibiting signs of distress from the heat. Five
weaned Corgi puppies (ID#s 22-019, 020, 021, 022, 023, 024) were sitting or laying with their heads outstretched and
their mouths as wide open as possible. The skin was taut with the ears pulled back and they were panting very heavily.

A Yorkshire Terrier female ( m/c# 985121008155308) with 2 puppies less than a week old (Id# 22-033, 034 DOB 7/24/22)
was standing and panting heavily while the puppies were crying and seeking her.
A Yorkshire Terrier female (Bear Bear, m/c# 992000000170786) was sitting with her mouth wide open, excessively
panting. Her three 3 week old puppies (Id#s 22-030, 031, 032 ) were crying with outstretched necks and moved to be
close to the water bowl that had just had cold water poured into it.
A Yorkshire Terrier female (Chloe, m/c#900001898042818) and her 5 puppies (DOB 7/9/22, Id3s 22-025, 026, 027, 028,
029) were panting excessively and curling close to the water bowl that had just been filled with cold water.
The temperature outdoors was 98 degrees F and the air conditioner was not functioning and the fans were inadequate to
decrease the temperature inside the building.
Unrelieved heat stress can lead to dehydration. Puppies are unable to thermoregulate which makes them more
susceptible to the hazardous effects of heat and humidity. The dams did not allow the puppies near them so they could
not nurse and this can add to dehydration and unmet nutritional needs.
When climatic conditions present a threat to animal health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate
the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity and time
that is detrimental to the animal’s health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal’s age, species,
breed, overall health status and acclimation.

These animals must be provided with an environment that is more suitable for their health and well-being and this must be
maintained.

Note: The dogs were placed in an air conditioned room in the house while a new air conditioner unit was being
purchased.
