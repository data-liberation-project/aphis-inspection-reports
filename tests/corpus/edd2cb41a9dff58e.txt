ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following medications stored in current drug storage area were past the expiration date:
Amoxil solution expired 10/2010
2 Boxes of Clavamox expired 9/2011 and 3/2010
These medications were intermingled with other pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the sheltered
facility and are therefore ready for use.
Use of expired medications is not an appropriate method to prevent, control, and treat diseases and
injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain and distress due to
mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or unexpected side effects.
The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance
with standard veterinary practices and manufacturers' recommendations.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was standing water and a noxious odor was present in the enclosure housing a zebu and 3 sheep. The
standing water is a result of a sewer line issue according to the property owner. This is essentially an open sewer
and is present due to a lateral line or septic tank issue. The property owner stated that dirt had been hauled in and
placed on top of the standing water in the past. Improper drainage systems and standing water where the animals
are contained may result in noxious odors, spreading of diseases, insect infestation and other health hazards. This
area needs to have a more permanent drainage solution, rather than relying on periodic dirt placement. All pens
housing animals must have an adequate drainage system that is able to eliminate standing water and waste more
rapidly for the overall health of the animals.Corrected by: 1 January 2015
