FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a horizontal ninety foot section of zebra-donkey hybrid (z-donk) enclosure fencing, located along the public
walkway, which consists of multiple layers of fence material. The fencing material includes: metal pipe, wooden
boards, railroad ties, and welded wire panels. Most of the vertical railroad ties are leaning, and the wooden boards
which were used to help secure the welded wire panels to the railroad ties, are broken in several areas and no
longer keep the panels securely fastened to the vertical crossties. This section of z-donk enclosure fencing is no
longer structurally sound and there are sharp edges along the top wooden rail where the z-donk could potentially
be injured. This section of fence must be repaired or replaced to safely contain the z-donk and to protect its health
and well-being. To be corrected by: July 18, 2014.

Inspection and exit briefing conducted with zoo director.
