2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee noticed a change in the fur of the 3 prairie dogs. Their coats appeared thin and unthrifty. However, the
licensee did not contact the veterinarian about the abnormal coats of the prairie dogs when first noted. The licensee
decided to wait for the monthly veterinary visit which was scheduled for 2.5 weeks after noting the problem. The licensee
failed to contact the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. In doing so, diagnosis and treatment for the illness was
delayed. Direct and frequent contact with the veterinarian when animals demonstrate any illness or abnormal medical
conditions is important to ensure optimum health of animals and to minimize spread of disease. The prairie dogs must be
examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment for the abnormal coat. Additionally, a plan to report illnesses to
the attending veterinarian in a timely manner must be developed and followed. Correct by September 24, 2021.

Sanitation.
There were two pieces of rusting metal equipment with rough or sharp edges in the pasture where the sheep, goats, pigs,
and alpaca roam. Leaving hazardous items in the field where the farm animals roam can lead to animal injury or illnesses.
Grounds should be kept in such a manner that protects the animals from injury. Unnecessary equipment must be
removed from the field and kept in a designated area away from the animals for their health and safety.


3.131(d) Repeat

Sanitation.
The building housing the sloth and feed items has evidence of a mouse infestation. An excessive amount of mouse feces
was seen on the feeding platform attached to the outside of the sloth cage. There are gaps in the insulation along the
seams and bottom edges that easily allow mice to come and go, as well as hide. An effective program for the control of
mammalian pests should include husbandry practices that minimize health risks for the animals. Measures must be taken
to prevent the entry and harborage of the mice for the health of the sloth and to minimize contamination of food supplies.
The licensee removed the mouse pellets on the feeding platform during the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
