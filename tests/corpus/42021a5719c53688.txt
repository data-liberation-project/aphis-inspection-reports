FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The wire fence material used at the bottom of the divider fence for the black bear Seymore has been bent and
torn leaving sharp points that may cause injury. The fence shall be repaired.
3.127(b) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The den boxes for the black bears are very shallow in depth not affording enough space for the bears to be fully
protected from the rain and cold. The dens are triangular shaped with the front fully open to the weather and there
is currently no bedding in any of the enclosures. During the inspection the temperature is 53 degrees with
temperatures expected to drop into the low thirties at night. Considering the age of the bears (11 - 23 yrs), the
single housing of four of the bears and the type of shelter provided, the shelters are inadequate to provide for the
health and well-being of the bears in the cold. An additional means of protection shall be provided to protect their
well-being. Correct by end of day.
***The singly housed cougars have shelters with front sides that are entirely open to the weather. There is no
bedding currently provided and no wind breaks. The shelters do not provide adequate protection from the wind and
cold. During the inspection the temperature is 53 degrees with temperatures expected to drop into the low thirties
at night. Additional means of warming and protection from inclement weather shall be provided. Correct by end of
day.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***The enclosure for the grey squirrel has a build up of hair and debris on the back side and on the edges of the
catch pan beneath the enclosure. There is hair and debris accumulating on the wall and floor behind the enclosure.
The enclosure, wall and floor shall be cleaned to minimize attraction for insects and rodents and thereby minimize
disease hazard. Corrected prior to end of inspection.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Wildlife Director.
