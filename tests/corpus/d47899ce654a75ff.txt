HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are stored materials in the marmoset exercise room such as boxes, shelving, and various equipment. The
animals may be trapped or injured when they climb in and around these materials. Animal areas inside of housing
facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture, or stored material.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The walls of the marmoset exercise room are spotted with waste and debris. Though mostly painted drywall, in
some areas the outer layer has peeled off exposing a surface that is difficult to clean and impossible to effectively
sanitize. There is also accumulated waste and debris on the floor in the closet area where some shelving is being
stored. Accumulated waste and debris expose the animals to disease hazards. Indoor primary enclosures must be
cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation
of dirt, debris, waste, food waste, excreta, or disease hazards.
