FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The concrete floor of a guinea pig housing room has a crack with a gap between the edges that is located in the
center of the room and spans approximately the width of the room. Debris could accumulate in the crack and that
area is not impervious to moisture. The facility must be maintained to be substantially impervious to moisture and
that can be readily sanitized for the well-being of the animals.
