INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The top surface of the surgery table on which the animal supporting stainless steel V shaped trough sits on is rusty.
The rust is especially evident on the top surface near the corners. The rusty surface is flaking off in pieces on the
one top corner. Major operative survival procedures are being conducted on pigs on this table. Rusty surfaces
cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized to provide an appropriate surface for asepsis to be maintained. Major
operative procedures on non-rodents will be conducted only in facilities intended for that purpose which shall be
operated and maintained under aseptic conditions. Correct by Sept. 4, 2015.
Exit conducted with undersigned IACUC Chair.
