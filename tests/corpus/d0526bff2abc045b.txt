There are two dogs identified on today's report as having dental issues. The Licensee'e had not noticed,
documented or started treatment for either of these dogs prior to today's inspection. Dental issues that are left
unnoticed and untreated can lead to several other heath issues for the dog. The licensee must preform daily
observation to identify all health issues, to include dental issues. In addition, the Licensee must have frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure all health issues are conveyed and treated within a timely
manor.
