Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility has record of regular attending veterinarian visits and a written program of veterinary care (PVC) that is signed
and approved by the attending veterinarian, however the approved PVC does not include a plan for complete physical
exams from head to tail of each dog by the attending veterinarian and a plan for sampling of parasites. Yearly physical
exams of each dog in the kennel and a plan for sampling of parasites are now required for optimum health of dogs.
Ensure that the written PVC addresses physical exams and parasite sampling as approved by the attending veterinarian.
