EMPLOYEES.
** The striped skunk escaped its primary enclosure when the employee left the door open while providing water.
The employee did not notice that it was no longer in the enclosure in which it later escaped the secondary
enclosure. Four days later the skunk was found dead as a result of a snake bite. The employees should be
adequately trained to properly secure the animals while executing husbandry practices. Correct from this day
forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the authorized person.
