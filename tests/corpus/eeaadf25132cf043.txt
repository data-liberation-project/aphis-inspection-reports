2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The following animals continue to suffer from poor body condition and/or poor hair coat and/or an untreated medical
condition.
• Arabian Oryx: Five Arabian oryx continue to be thin with prominent ribs, vertebrae and hips and little muscle covering
the hindquarters.
• Arabian oryx: One female Arabian oryx continues to be thin with a large mass on her chest.
• Red deer: The male red deer is thin with a “pot” belly. He has a patchy hair coat with short, thin hair in some area and
long hair in others.
• White-tailed deer: One female whitetail continues to be extremely thin with a patchy hair coat with prominent ribs,
vertebrae and hips and little muscle covering the hindquarters.
• White-tailed deer: One male whitetail continues to be extremely thin with prominent ribs, vertebrae and hips and little
muscle covering the hindquarters.
• Addax: There are approximately 4 Addax in the front pen and 4 Addax in the middle pen that continue to be thin with
prominent ribs, vertebrae and hips and little muscle covering the hindquarters.
The attending veterinarian’s treatment plan for the thin animals (unlimited alfalfa hay to be made available and veterinary


rechecks in 1 month) has not resolved the problem in the animals listed above. There are multiple reasons these animals
could be thin which include parasitism, poor dentition, malnutrition, competition from herd mates, and systemic disease.
Minimal diagnostics have been employed to determine the exact cause of the problems in the above animals. Without
proper diagnostics and treatment based on the results of the diagnostics, the animals’ conditions may not improve or
worsen.
The facility must assure that appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries are
utilized. The licensee must assure that the veterinary services obtained have the experience and knowledge of the
species at the facility.
2.40(b)(3) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Arabian Oryx: One oryx was noted to be limping during this inspection. The licensee stated, “the animal has been
limping since it was born”. When asked if a veterinarian had evaluated the animal, the licensee said no.
The facility must ensure that all animals are checked daily and that any potential problems are discussed as soon as
possible with the veterinarian.
If this animal had received veterinary care at birth, it’s limp may have been corrected. The licensee needs to notify the
attending veterinarian about this animal and discuss the long-term plans for this animal.
3.81 Direct Repeat

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The primates including, 2 spider monkeys, 3 lar gibbons, and 12 ring-tailed lemurs, continue to have minimal to no
enrichment.
The enrichment available for the 3 gibbons did not appear to have been changed since the previous inspection.
The spider monkeys have a very large enclosure, however there were no enrichment items present in the enclosure at the


time of inspection.
The lemurs are housed in enclosures that range in size from 2x4x4 feet to 6x6x6 feet. There was only one lemur
enclosure with enrichment and that consisted of a single plastic ball. The size of the lemur enclosures does not allow for
climbing or other natural behaviors to be performed.
The facility has an environmental enhancement plan; however, it is not being followed. Primates are extremely intelligent
animals therefore it is important they be provided with environmental enhancement that includes some means of
expressing non-injurious species-typical activities and cognitive/sensory enrichment.
The facility needs to implement an environmental enrichment plan that has been approved by the attending veterinarian.
3.133 Critical

Separation.
The male sika deer that had been identified as thin with a poor hair coat on previous inspections was killed by the other
male sika housed in the same enclosure. The licensee knew there was conflict between the animals but failed to
separate in a timely manner. Competition between these two animals could have been the reason the dead male was in
such poor body condition.
Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. The licensee needs to observe and identify
incompatible animals in a timelier fashion so that competition between animals does not result in animals with poor body
condition or dead animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees.
