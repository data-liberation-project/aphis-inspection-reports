MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on29-Aug-19 at 1:40 PM.
The inspector arrived at the facility at 1:40 PM and knocked on the door twice. No one answered the door. The
inspector then called the registrant. No one answered the phone call. The inspector left a voicemail. The registrant
had not returned the phone call by 2:10 PM, so the inspector left the facility.
