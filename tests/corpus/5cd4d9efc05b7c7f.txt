2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1226 on
16-APR-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I knocked on the door of the house located at the facility site. I called Ms. Ball's primary
phone number at 12:26 PM, and Ms. Ball's spouse answered the phone. He indicated he was present at the site,
but that I was too late, because he had to leave promptly for an appointment elsewhere. He indicated the licensee
would be available the following day. During our call, another phone was ringing in the background, at which time he
indicated he had to go and he disconnected the phone call with me. The call was disconnected before I could ask
any further questions about conducting the inspection on the day I drove to the facility.
