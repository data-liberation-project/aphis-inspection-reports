Facilities, general.
Several areas of fencing, within the alpaca, sheep, and goat enclosures, are in a state of disrepair. The metal panel on
the front of the petting zoo enclosure is broken in two areas which is allowing for larger gaps, approximately 6" x 8" in
size. In the large alpaca, sheep, and goat enclosure, the facility has replaced the previously fallen posts between the
enclosure and the adjacent horse pasture, however, the fence lines are still not secured to the posts and are hanging
partially suspended. Along the far left edge of this enclosure, there is also an area of electric fencing that has become
detached from the posts and is hanging freely. These areas of down fences have allowed the sheep and goats to enter
the adjacent horse barn and pasture areas.
Failure to maintain enclosure fencing can allow for gaps, unstable structures, or loose fencing wires which can result in
injury, entrapment, or escape of the animals. Facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and contain them.

The facility inspection was conducted with a facility representative. The record review and exit interview were conducted
with the owner.
