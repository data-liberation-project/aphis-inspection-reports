2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The amount of injectable solution for euthanasia prescribed by the attending veterinarian was not followed by the
licensee. The licensee made changes to the procedure without the attending veterinarian's approval. The inspector
spoke with the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was not comfortable with the changes made by
the licensee and does not approve the changes.
Improper methods of euthanasia can cause pain and distress to the animal. Not following the directions of the
attending veterinarian does not ensure adequate veterinary care. The licensee shall assure that the attending
veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provisions of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the
adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
To be corrected by: This day forward
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
