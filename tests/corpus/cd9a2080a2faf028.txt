Facilities, general.
An 8-year-old male wolf is housed in an indoor/outdoor hospital pen (Ward #5 and #6, which are share a connected
outdoor area, animal has access to inside area of both wards). The animal is being treated for a mild skin condition. There
is one doorway between the indoor and outdoor areas of Ward #5, and there is another doorway between the indoor and
outdoor areas of Ward #6. Neither doorway has a door (the doors have been removed). The doorways are framed with
metal door frames.
In Ward #5, the bottom 6 inches of the metal door frame to the outdoors is badly rusted and approximately 4 inches of the
metal frame is missing, leaving a jagged metal edge.
In Ward #6, the bottom 6 inches of the metal door frame to the outdoors is badly rusted and approximately 4 inches of the
metal frame is missing, leaving a jagged metal edge.
There is a metal sliding gate in the outdoor area of Ward #5, which covers an opening to the outdoor area of Ward #4.
This gate was closed during the inspection. The lower outer corner of the gate is badly rusted, with rust covering an area
approximately 1 square foot in size. In the bottom corner of this rusted area, there is a hole approximately 2 inches tall
and 4 inches wide, which is surrounded by rust and has jagged edges.


Primary enclosures that have areas of severe rust, jagged edges, and holes may scrape, entrap, or otherwise injure
animals within the enclosure.
Correct by August 12th, 2021 by maintaining primary enclosures in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
contain the animals.

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility houses a variety of exotic animals including tigers, rhino, wolves, and nonhuman primates including
chimpanzees. There are sections of the facility's perimeter fence that are covered with vines, foliage, and are in close
contact with small trees.
The chain link perimeter fence along 'hoofstock road' is severely overgrown with vines and other plants, which cover 90%
of the fence. There is dense shrubbery in front of- and behind the fence extending approximately 3 feet high. There are
wires along the top of the fence which are weighed down by the weight of the plants. There are 6 small (1 foot diameter)
trees that touch or are within 6 inches of the fence. The Zoo Manager stated that there was chain link fence throughout
the 'back 20' acres of the zoo that is similarly overgrown. USDA personnel were unable to inspect the perimeter fence in
the 'back 20' acres area due to impassable shrubbery.
There is a section of the chain link perimeter fence near the Curator's office that is severely overgrown with vines and
other plants. Tall plants and trees grow on both sides of the fence, and vines grow through the openings in the chain link.
There is a section of the chain link perimeter fence near the Education building that is completely covered by plants and
vines, when viewed from within the Zoo.
A perimeter fence protects animals in the Zoo from contact with unauthorized people and animals; it also acts as a
secondary containment system in the event that an animal escapes from its primary enclosure. Excessive vines, shrubs,
and trees makes it easier for animals to climb the fence, reducing the effectiveness of the fence as a secondary


containment system.
Correct by August 12th, 2021 by maintaining a perimeter fence that is in good repair, that prevents entry of unauthorized
people and animals, and acts as an effective secondary containment system in the event an animal escapes from its
primary enclosure. Perimeter fence must also be in compliance with 3.77(d) for non-human primates.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
