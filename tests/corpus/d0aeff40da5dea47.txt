2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
A mishap with the gates on or around 11/17/2021 allowed a marble fox to get out of its primary enclosure. It was able to
leave the property and the facility was notified about 3 days later by a neighbor of its location. Attempts to capture it were
unsuccessful and it ended up getting hit sometime by a car on the public road and died. A method to prevent future
incidents includes ensuring that the first gate is closed and latched prior to opening the second gate that opens into the
primary enclosure with the animals. Ensure that handling methods of animals are in place to prevent any trauma or
physical harm of animals.

Correct from this day forward.

3.127(d) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.

The perimeter fence did not serve as a secondary containment system for a marble fox that got out of its primary
enclosure in November 2021. The facility reports that it is not known where it got through the perimter to leave the facility.
A perimeter fence is required to protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals from going through it or under in
the event that an animal gets out of its primary enclosure. Ensure that the perimeter fence is constructed and maintainted
so that it protects the animals in the facility by serving as a secondary containment system.

Correct from this day forward.

**During inspection we observed a hole in the bottom portion of the northwest area of the perimeter fence near the blond
raccoon's primary enclosure. This area of disrepair is an area where animals could get through and needs to be
repaired/replaced. Ensure that the perimeter fence is constructed and maintained to protect animals in the facility as a
secondary containment system and to prevent outside animals from entering this area.

Correct this area of disrepair by 2/23/2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
