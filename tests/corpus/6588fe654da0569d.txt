2.75(b)(1)(4)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on June 30, 2015, records of animal sales were not maintained with the name and
address of the person to whom an animal was sold or given. Records must be kept and maintained on all guinea pig
sales for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care program, and to comply with the Animal Welfare
regulations. APHIS 7020 forms were previously left with the licensee to help maintain records. The licensee must
ensure that all sale records are kept and maintained and that sale records include the name and address of the
buyer to keep track of animal shipments. Correct by February 17, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
