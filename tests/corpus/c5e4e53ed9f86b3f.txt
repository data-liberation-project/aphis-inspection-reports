3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
1. The 2 guinea pig restraint devices were constructed with a top made of wire mesh and a floor made of wood.
The outermost layer of the wood had worn off of approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of the floor’s surface exposing the
underlying particle board wood. The exposed particle board wood areas of the floor of both restrainers appeared
thicker than the rest of the floor where the outermost layer was intact. The thickened appearance of the exposed
particle board wood indicates that the wood had adsorbed liquid or moisture.
Per this Section of the Regulations, enclosures used to house guinea pigs shall be constructed of material
substantially impervious to liquids and moisture. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be effectively
cleaned or sanitized which can affect the health of the animals.
The floors of the 2 guinea pig restrainers need to be replaced with a material impervious to moisture.
Correct by 11/23/16.
