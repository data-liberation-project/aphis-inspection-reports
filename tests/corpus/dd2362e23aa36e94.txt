HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Section 2.131(c)(1) Handling of animals: The barrier fence for the enclosure housing two maned wolves is not
sufficient to protect the public. This enclosure has a concrete wall with a flat top that is wide enough for a person to
try to stand a child on top to view the maned wolves. There is a metal barrier fence to keep people back from the
concrete wall, but there are areas where a person could reach across to place a child on top of the concrete wall. A
child standing on the concrete wall could fall down into the exhibit and be injured by the hot wire, animals or the
physical fall. The barrier fence for the maned wolves must prevent the public from having access to the enclosure
for the safety of the public and the animals. Correct by August 4, 2015.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Section 3.80(a)(2)(ii) General requirements: The enclosures housing five gorillas use fire hoses for enrichment that
are secured with bolts that extend about 1-2 inches beyond the fire hose material. The ends of these bolts may
injure a gorilla grabbing the fire hose in the area of the bolts or if a fire hose swings and hits a gorilla with the
protruding bolts. The bolts ends must be cut down or another attachment device used to secure the fire hoses to
prevent injury to the animals. Correct by August 4, 2015.
Note: This inspection was conducted on July 20-21, 2015. An exit interview was conducted with the Director of
