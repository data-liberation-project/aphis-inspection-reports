INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol involving dogs and cats did not contain an adequate rationale for the appropriateness
of the numbers of animals to be used for that activity. The protocol stated that 20 dogs and 20 cats would be used
but there was no rationale provided for why these were the numbers needed.
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that proposals to conduct activities in ongoing activities involving
animals contain rationales that explain the appropriateness of the number of animals to be used in those activities.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The following was noted in two animal use rooms: 1) There was a moderate accumulation of dust on the counter
tops and around the sinks. 2) Ants were present. The existing pest control program was not sufficient as there were
an excessive amount of ants present.
In one animal use room: 1) There was peeling paint on a wall behind a sink where lab glassware was being stored.
2) There were cobwebs present in a windowsill. 3) A plastic fluorescent light cover was damaged.
Failure to clean and maintain the facilities as required may adversely affect the health and well-being of animals
used in these areas. Animal areas must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to
facilitate the husbandry practices required in this subpart, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for
rodents and other pests and vermin.
