2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Shih Tzu (microchip #104076110) has poor dental health. A thick build-up of brown tartar is covering the
entire surface of the upper left canine tooth and the upper left and right cheek teeth. Nearly the entire surface of the
upper right canine tooth is also covered in brown colored tartar. The gums are slightly reddened. The licensee had
identified the dog was in need of dental care on January 27, 2018, but at the time of the inspection (April 05, 2018)
the dog has not yet received any treatment.
Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment
plan. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell, ACI Corbin Ranslem, and the facility representative.
