ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Eight chinchillas had health problems that had not been addressed by the facility. The facility has not reported
these problems to the attending veterinarian:
--A beige female (GROS 639) had been treated for an abscess under its chin by the facility. During inspection the
area of the abscess appeared swollen. On closer examination, we found that the chinchilla's collar was encrusted
with matted fur and its tissue appeared swollen and encrusted around the collar. The licensee gently removed the
collar and there was an open sore around most of the neck where the collar had been. The sore had a pale liquid
discharge mixed with a pale granular-type discharge in it and had a strong putrid odor.
--A black female (GROS 204) had a red, hairless swollen area under her chin.
--A beige male (GROS 331) had both eyes swollen shut with hair loss around the eyelids. A pale discharge came
out from under the eyelids when the licensee touched the eyelids.
Indirect non-compliances:
--A beige female's (eartag# GROS 245) left eye was crusted shut with a pale crusted material.
--A white chinchilla with cage card 10-25-16 had an open wound on its back. The licensee reported that it was
purchased with a wound and they have been treating it; however the attending veterinarian has not been consulted
on the treatment for the wound.
--A black/silver male (cage card C323) was squinting its right eye. The eyelids were observed to have some hair
loss and appeared swollen and had some discharge towards the front part of the eye.
--A beige female's (eartag# GROS 311) right eye was sealed shut with a pale material.
--A white female's (no ID) had a pale discharge towards the front of its left eye.
***Untreated medical problems such as what was seen in the affected chinchillas cause unnecessary prolonged
pain and if the chinchilla's condition is contagious it can cause more chinchillas in the building to get sick. The
facility must have the attending veterinarian evaluate each of these animals and treat them as directed by the
veterinarian.

While we were searching for animals cited on the February 8, 2017 inspection report to confirm if they have
received veterinary treatment; we identified 7 different chinchillas with health problems that need treatment. The
facility had identified about 20 animals with health problems prior to inspection and reported treating them; however
these 7 chinchillas listed below have health problems that had not been identified and were not being treated:
-A beige female (GROS 639) had its collar encrusted by its own fur and tissue and had a putrid odor from the sore
around the collar.
-A black female (GROS 204) had a red, hairless swollen area under her chin.
-A beige male (GROS 331) had both eyes swollen shut with hair loss around the eyelids.
-A beige female's (eartag# GROS 245) left eye was crusted shut with a pale crusted material.
-A black/silver male (cage card C323) right eyelids had hair loss and appeared swollen and had some discharge
towards the front part of the eye.
-A beige female's (eartag# GROS 311) right eye was sealed shut with a pale material around the eyelids.
-A white female's (no ID) left eye had a pale discharge towards the front of its left eye.
Adequate daily observations are needed to promptly identify health problems so that the affected animal can be
treated. The facility must refine the methods of daily observations so that any animal with a health problem can be
treated per the attending veterinarian's instructions.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a large buildup of soiled excreta in the middle gutter at the far east end of the middle room of the facility.
In the immediate vicinity of this waste buildup there were strong odors where 8 chinchillas are housed above the
buildup. This buildup of material and foul odors can cause animals to get sick. The facility must not allow excreta to
excessively accumulate and must eliminate the excessive buildup waste often enough to minimize vermin
infestation, odors, and disease hazards.
A deceased chinchilla (cage card Z32) was observed within an enclosure with live chinchillas housed on both sides
of it. The deceased chinchilla was bloated, had peeling skin, a strong odor, and its limbs were stiff. These
observations suggest it had been there for more than a day. Dead animals must be disposed of promptly to prevent
attraction of pests and prevent spread of disease to other animals around the enclosure. Ensure dead animals are
removed promptly from animal housing areas on a daily basis.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
At least two enclosures had an excessive accumulation of wet food material around the water sipper valve. Anexcessive accumulation of feces can increase animals' risks for disease and does not provide for their comfort.
Enclosures must be cleaned out as often as necessary to minimize excessive accumulations of soiled material.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
