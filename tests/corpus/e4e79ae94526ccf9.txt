FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence currently surrounding the 11-month old bear’s closed-top enclosure is 5 feet in height. All
outdoor housing facilities for potentially dangerous animals including bears must be surrounded by a perimeter
fence at least 8 feet in height. Additionally, it must be at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure. These
requirements of a perimeter fence are necessary to help ensure that unauthorized persons or animals cannot
access the facility, to prevent physical contact between animals inside the primary enclosure and animals or
persons outside the perimeter fence, and to effectively function as a secondary containment system in case of
animal escape. Perimeter fences less than 8 feet in height or less than 3 feet in distance from the primary
enclosure for potentially dangerous animals such as bears must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
A perimeter fence surrounding the bear enclosure must be constructed to achieve 8 feet in height and must be at
least 3 feet from the bear’s primary enclosure or approval must be obtained.

SANITATION.
Food storage/supplies room: There is a general accumulation of clutter in this room with several miscellaneous
animal supplies, including food, bedding and other animal items stored in an untidy and unorganized manner.
Additionally, on top of an animal use refrigerator was a heavy accumulation of dust and several insecticide/pesticide
products stored and intermingled with animal medications. Inappropriate storage of potentially toxic or hazardous
products may result in the unintentional contamination of animal items.
Premises including buildings, surrounding grounds and other animal areas must be kept clean, free of clutter and in
good repair in order to protect the health and well-being of the animals, to prevent the harborage of vermin and
pests, and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. A system of maintaining effective housekeeping
practices must be in place.Correct by 02/20/2017.
