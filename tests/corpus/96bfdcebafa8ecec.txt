ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A covered species was not included in the approved written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). All covered species
should be addressed in the PVC to ensure the facility has a program to follow concerning the care of all the animals.
Failure to do so could adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. A complete and accurate written
Program of Veterinary Care with consultation from the attending veterinarian must be in place.
