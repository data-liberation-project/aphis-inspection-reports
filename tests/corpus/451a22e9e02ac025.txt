ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Numerous containers (over 6) of outdated medications were noted in the drug storage area. Additionally other
containers were inadequately labled - not specifying which dog was to receive the medication or the expiration date.
Lastly many of the containers in this area were covered with dust.
For the health and safety of the animals all of these issues must be addressed.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** All dog shelters, being on pallets, are raised above ground level. However not all of the surface area of some
pallets is covered by the shelters. The result is that in these situations, an animal could injure itself if it were to
catch a leg or paw in the exposed slats of the pallet.
To protect the animals from injury, this situation must be addressed.
Correct by 8/30/14.
*** Some sections of fence in the enclosure that the hybrid "Angel" occupies are rusted and other sections sag
inward. The rusted sections of fence need to be replaced and the sagging sections supported and tightened in
order to make the fence structurally sound and contain the hybrid securely.

3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The freezer where meat is presently being stored is iced over and should be defrosted and cleaned. It also
appears quite old and it's future reliability is questionable. To prevent the risk of food deterioration and/or
contamination this situation should be addressed.
Correct by 10/15/14.
*** The knives used to cut meat fed to the hybrids are stored in punctures made in a deteriorating back splash
behind the carving table. The back splash should be replaced and the knives stored in a hygenic manner in order to
reduce the risk of food contamination.Correct by 7/29/14.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** At this time, none of the wooden shelters have a wind/rain break at the entrances to protect the dogs from the
elements. This is particularly important because the winter climate in the area can be severe.
Correct by 10/15/14.
3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
*** Although the dogs appear to have adequate room for exercise, it is important for the welfare of the dogs that a
plan providing the opportunity for exercise be approved by the attending veterinarian and be made available to
APHIS inspectors on request. Of particular importance is sufficient snow/ice removal in the winter to allow the
opportunity for exercise.
Correct by 8/22/14.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The growth of foliage (bushed, grass, weeds) in approximately 10 of the enclosures, containing about 20 dogs,
is excessive. The animals are difficult to observe, and the tall growth inhibits pest control. For the health and
well-being of the animals foliage should be reduced.
Correct by 10/30/14.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative on 7/22/14.
An example of an exercise plan for dogs and examples of APHIS Forms 7005 & 7006 were left at the facility.
