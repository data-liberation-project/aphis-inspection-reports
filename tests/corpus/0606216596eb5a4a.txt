2.40(b)(3) Critical Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Geoffroy’s cat was identified on the last inspection (March 7th, 2022) as requiring medical attention for a
squinting right eye, a scab above the same eye and general hair loss on the trunk of its body. During the follow up exit
interview call, the licensee confirmed he had not contacted the attending veterinarian regarding the Geoffroy’s cat. At the
time of this inspection, the new attending veterinarian had evaluated the animal and was working with the facility to
provide follow up care if needed. The issue with the eye had resolved and the hair was regrowing. Failure to communicate
health concerns to the attending veterinarian in a direct and timely manner may affect the health and well-being of the
animals.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The records of acquisition for the following animals were missing: prairie dogs, goats, pigs, New Guinea Singing Dog
puppies, rabbits and savannah cat. Complete acquisition records are required to be in compliance with animal welfare
regulations.
3.78(d)

Outdoor housing facilities.


At the time of inspection, USDA inspectors identified several areas along the perimeter fence that were not at a height of
6ft due to objects being stacked against the fence. There were sections of the fence that had natural shrubbery or trees
directly adjacent to the fence that acted as climbing implements. USDA inspectors identified areas at the bottom of the
fence where animals had dug sizeable holes under the perimeter fence. The trees and miscellaneous objects leaning
against the fence allow for humans and/or animals to climb in or out of the property. Additionally, the holes under the
fence allow unwanted access by animals to the property. The fence must be constructed so that it protects nonhuman
primates by restricting unauthorized humans, and animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the nonhuman primates.
Correct prior to scheduling the next relicense inspection.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
There were several enclosures with areas in need of repair. The wooden support beam in an enclosure housing a
mountain coati and a raccoon had areas of wood rot. A wooden perch in an enclosure housing two cougars had a section
of wood that was splintered and exposed a nail. A wooden 2x8 beam on the platform for a caracal and bobcat had
splintered areas. An enclosure housing a Syrian brown bear and black bear had an area of the roof fencing that was
warped creating a large area for the bears to put their paws through. Wood rot in primary support structures can affect the
integrity of the enclosure. Splintered wood and exposed nails pose risks of entrapment or injury. The outdoor housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.


At the time of inspection, USDA inspectors identified several areas along the perimeter fence that were not at a height of
8ft due to objects being stacked against the fence. There were sections of the fence that had natural shrubbery or trees
directly adjacent to the fence that acted as climbing implements. USDA inspectors identified areas at the bottom of the
fence where animals had dug sizeable holes under the perimeter fence. The trees and miscellaneous objects leaning
against the fence allow for humans and/or animals to climb in or out of the property. Additionally, the holes under the
fence allow unwanted access by animals to the property. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in
the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it, or under it and having contact with the
animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
Correct prior to scheduling the next relicense inspection.
