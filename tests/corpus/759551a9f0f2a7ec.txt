2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee does not have a program of veterinary care with written instruction on the care of the animals held by
the facility including a dog, rabbits, cats, pigs, cows, goats and sheep.
Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time
attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor.
Have the veterinarian(s) complete a written program of veterinary care for all species maintained at the facility.
Veterinary recommendations for care of all animals must be included in the program. APHIS inspectors then use
this information while inspecting the animals in order to determine if veterinary recommendations are being followed
by the facility. This program is a valuable tool in order to ensure the continuing health and comfort of these animals.
To be corrected by April 16, 2015.
