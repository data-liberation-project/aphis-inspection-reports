2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown, adult female Shiba Inu identified by tattoo number #50, has a problem with its left front leg. The dog is
carrying its leg in an abnormal manner. The leg is non-weight bearing and when the dog tries to walk it hops to
avoid applying weight to the leg. The dog did not put its foot down the entire time while being observed by the
inspectors. Failure of the dog to bear weight on its leg could indicate pain, discomfort and an underlying health
condition. The facility representatives stated that they were not aware of the problem but it may have been
documented on the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s weekly report. The documentation for this problem does not indicate a
diagnosis and treatment plan. It simply states (cid:28)"front foot watch close will recheck June 22 Wed(cid:29)". This does not
ensure the dog is receiving adequate veterinary care.
A white, adult female Lhasa Apso identified by tattoo number #1, has a problem with both eyes. The tissue around
both eyes is inflamed and reddened in appearance. The white of the left eye is extremely red in color and the hair
surrounding the eye is wet. There is also a greenish-yellow discharge coming from both eyes. A crusty brown
material is matted in the fur surrounding both eyes. Documentation for this dog does not indicate a diagnosis. There
is a treatment plan listed but no records showing the treatment plan is being administered. Abnormal eye and skin
conditions can be painful and cause discomfort to the dog.
A brown, adult female Olde Bulldog identified by tattoo number #288, has an abnormal tissue growth in the corner
of its right eye. The growth is covering approximately one-third of the eye(cid:25)s surface. There is also a whitish colored
discharge coming from the eye. The problem was identified first on April 27, 2016 by the attending veterinarian. The
document simply states that the attending veterinarian will remove the growth when fully developed. The records do
not address the moist and whitish colored discharge that is coming from the eye. Abnormal tissue growth can be
painful and cause discomfort for the dog.
The licensee must have the animals listed above examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented in detail and provided to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The female Bulldog identified by tattoo number #257 and the male Golden Retriever identified by microchip number015-812-600 on the March 28, 2016 inspection report received veterinary care. The two Wheaten Terriers identified
by tattoo numbers #135 and #66 received toenail maintenance.

Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the licensee, three facility representatives, Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Corbin
