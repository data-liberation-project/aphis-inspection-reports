Time and method of identification.
12 French Bulldogs in the kennel that are older than 16 weeks of age do not have official identification affixed. Official
identification (such as a tag) is required for all dogs 16 weeks or older in the kennel. Lack of proper identification can
make tracking health information and husbandry tasks difficult. Ensure all dogs are properly identified as required.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Some breeding dogs weren't recorded on APHIS 7005 Record of Acquisition and Dog and Cats on Hand: 4 French
Bulldogs delivered to the kennel from New York on 12-13-2020 and 8 French Bull Dogs delivered to the kennel from New
York on 11-04-2020. All adult dogs on hand must be recorded on APHIS 7005. Accurate and complete records are
required in case animal tracking needs to be done (for example health tracking). Ensure the record of dogs on hand
(APHIS 7005) is kept up to date and accurate at all times.

Housing facilities, general.


An adult dog was out during inspection and under the enclosure decking inside the kennel. The licensee said she jumped
out an open enclosure door. The area under the enclosure decking is narrow and difficult for an average adult-sized
person to access. The licensee said help from someone that fits under the area will be needed to be able to catch it.
Ensure that enclosures safely contain all dogs and this area under the decking is corrected so if a dog briefly gets out it
can be caught easily and safely without having it get under it where it can't easily be caught.

Note: The dog had been caught and returned to its primary enclosure prior to the exit interview.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The area outside the kennel is in need of some clean-up and housekeeping: A buildup of wet shavings and soiled
material on the outside areas in front of the runs is creating an area for flies to live and breed in. There are weeds by the
door that are growing tall and on the southwest corner outside there is a large pile of old shavings. Buildup of old
shavings and overgrown weeds creates areas for flies and pests to breed in. Ensure the area around the building is kept
clean and in good repair to eliminate areas that pests can live and breed in.
