Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:46am on
10/12/2021. We called the licensee who said a person that can accompany inspectors was away and couldn't be back
until late afternoon. We discussed optimal hours of inspection.
