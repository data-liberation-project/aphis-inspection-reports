ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Some animals were observed to have medical conditions requiring veterinary assessment or examination. A female
lion had hair loss around the eyes, face, back and ear margins. A white raccoon was thin, had hair loss and was
walking stiffly. When asked for information regarding what veterinary care these animals were receiving, the owner
stated that she does not keep any veterinary medical records at all and that everything is with her attending
veterinarian. She provided the number for the veterinarian and told us we would have to call him to get any
information that we needed on any of the sick animals. The information available at the time of the inspection and
the following day was not sufficient to demonstrated adequate veterinary care for these animals.
Licensees shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate methods
to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Every facility should have a system of health records
sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate the delivery of adequate health care. Animals that are sick, injured, or
have medical problems must be examined by a veterinarian.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
A single ringed-tail lemur and a single bush baby were each individually housed in their respective enclosures
without being able to see and hear any other nonhuman primate of their own or a compatible species; psychological
distress secondary to social isolation could develop. The Environmental Enhancement plan was generic and did
not include provisions for social grouping of specific species. Also, the Environmental Enhancement Plan did not
address considerations for a nonhuman primate that could not see or hear animals of their own or other compatible
nonhuman primates. The owner stated that the lemur had been separated from another one due to aggression but
no reason was provided for the animal being house out of sight and hearing of others of its species. The reason
given by the licensee for the bush baby being housed singly was the loss of its mate approximately a year
previously. However, this did not provide and explanation for housing it out of sight or hearing of other nonhuman
primates. Individually housed nonhuman primates must be able to see and hear nonhuman primates of their own or
compatible species unless the attending veterinarian determines that it would endanger their health, safety, or
well-being. The basis for exempting an individual animal from participation in the environmental enhancement planmust be recorded by the attending veterinarian for each exempted nonhuman primate and must be reviewed at
least every 30 days unless the basis for the condition is a permanent condition. The Environmental Enhancement
Plan needs to be reviewed/updated, and must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards
as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing the jungle cat had a hole in the fencing in the lower left corner where the wires were bent
and separated. This could create a risk of escape or injury. This was repaired shortly after it was pointed out to the
owner.
An enclosure housing two lions had a den with a board on the roof which was separating from the structure and
had a screw/nail coming loose. Loose boards and sharp metal in the enclosure could cause injury.
The single zebra was housed in a pasture with fencing constructed of welded wire panels along the sides, and
barbed wire strands on the far end. The zebra was observed to rub it’s head on the side fencing where there were
exposed sharp wire points at eye level. Additionally, the zebra ran along the fence line and was observed tripping
and getting tangled in a dead tree limb that had fallen near the fence. The animal was trotting/strutting around and
bumping up against the fence; including the barbed-wire section. The sharp points in the fence panel, the sharp
points of the barbed wire, and the tree limb debris all pose a risk of injury. Debris and sharp pointed objects should
be removed, repaired, or replaced.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.
The facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The primary enclosure for Oriental small-clawed otters did not have an appropriate pool/container for the animals to
swim; only a small shallow bucket of water was observed at the enclosure. An otter was observed going to the
shallow container several times and trying to get in it but it was barely big enough for it to fit in with the water coming
up to about belly height. The licensee said that they have access to a big swimming pool on another part of the
property two to three times a day when they do visitor “swim-with” encounters. However, encounters with the public
do not occur every day. Otters are aquatic animals and a normal behavior for them, and for which they are adapted,
is to swim. The enclosure was not adequate to allow normal postural and social adjustments and freedom of
movement for this species. The licensee showed the inspectors another pen that she said they had plans to
renovate which had a pool. The lack of appropriate housing for this species can be detrimental to the health and
wellbeing of the animals and could cause distress to animals. The primary enclosure needs to provide sufficientspace to allow an otter to make normal postural, behavioral and social adjustments with adequate freedom of
movement; including normal swimming behavior for the species. If an enclosure does not have species typical
behavioral components such as swimming options available due to the presence of an injured or disabled otter and
there are veterinary concerns for the animals safety, the space and swimming needs of healthy otters in the
enclosure must still be addressed. Alternative swimming opportunities must be provided for the healthy otter(s) or
they should be moved to another enclosure with a pool of adequate size to allow swimming. It is recommended that
you document the timing and frequency of alternative swimming opportunities so AC can verify that the otter’s
natural needs are being met.
In order to prevent potential health problems and abnormal behavior patterns for an aquatic species, a
pool/container of adequate size must be available in the primary enclosure.
