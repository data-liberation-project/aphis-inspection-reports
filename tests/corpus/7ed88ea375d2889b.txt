FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The meat cooler had an overwhelming odor of rotten and decaying meat. This odor makes it very hard to determine
if the meat items stored in this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the cooler, identify the source of the
odor and eliminate it.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Deteriorating bags of lettuce, discolored oranges, softening apples
and another deteriorating bagged produce were present in the cooler. This produce was stored on the already
sorted (feed side of the cooler). Spoiled produce must be removed promptly to prevent contamination of food
intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce promptly. This cooler needs to be cleaned and
have spoiled and deteriorating items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will be fed to the
animals. A decaying dead rodent was noted inside a bin containing old monkey biscuits and a bag of dog food
which was being fed to the emus according to the CEO. The facility management claims to be sorting the produce
again before feeding but the deteriorating and rotten condition of the produce present in the American black bear
and Asian black bear food receptacle boxes makes it impossible for APHIS inspectors to determine if this is true.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Sections of the perimeter fence near Mohan's enclosure and near the grizzly bear enclosure are becoming over run
with vines and trees. This excess of vegetation must be trimmed back to ensure the structural integrity of the fence
and to allow for proper inspection of the fence. Large, dangerous animals are housed at this facility and the
perimeter fence serves as a secondary barrier between these animals and the public. Any animal escape could
have potentially lethal outcomes for the animal or a member of the public. Remove excess vegetation from these
sections of the perimeter fence and any other areas of the perimeter where it is needed.

FEEDING. The food receptacle boxes for the American black bear, Asian black bear and Syrian brown bear enclosures need to
be cleaned. There is a large amount of rotting food debris in and around the Asian and American black bear boxes.
All bear food receptacle boxes have walls and sides which are very dirty. These food receptacles are not sanitary.
The grizzly bear is being fed on the dirt floor inside its shelter. Any food fed in this areas is going to be
contaminated by the rotting material present. These feeders need to be cleaned and made sanitary to ensure that
the food fed to the bears is wholesome and free from bacterial or pest infestation which could result in health issues
for the bears. Diarrhea was noted inside the enclosures for the Asian black bears and American black bears. The
CEO commented that diarrhea was quite a common occurrence for the bears and believed that this was very
common in bears.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the tiger known as Daisy had a large amount of algae slime lining
its interior. The water was green in appearance. The coyote water bucket had a layer of brown slime inside it. The
water receptacle for the Syrian Brown bear enclosure contained a small amount of green water with algae floating in
it. The American black bear water receptacle was empty. The pool inside the enclosure contained filthy green
water. The water receptacle for the cougar contained very dirty water with material floating in it. These water
receptacles are not being cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis. Water receptacles should be kept clean and
sanitary to promote adequate water consumption which is essential for animal health. Clean and sanitize these
water receptacles more frequently.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive feces in the tiger known as Lilly's enclosure. There was excessive food waste inside Lilly's
shelter. There was excessive food waste and feces inside the shelter for the tiger known as Daisy. There was
excessive feces and food waste in the tiger known as Mohan's enclosure. There was excessive food waste in the
den area of Mohan's enclosure. There is excessive food waste and rotting produce near the food receptacle and in
the Asian black bear enclosure. There is excessive bones and food waste in the enclosure for the grizzly bear.
There was excessive food waste and rotting material present in the cougar den box. There was excessive fecal
material in the cougar's enclosure. An enclosure housing two foxes contained excessive feces and damp soiled
bedding material. These enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis. This rotting material and feces
can lead to pest control issues. With warmer weather coming to the area quite soon these odor and pest control
issues will be exacerbated. The rotting material present in these animal enclosures can contaminate them as they
lie in their enclosures. These animals can ingest this material when they groom. Not removing old food wastepromptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting this rotten material can lead to potential health problems.
Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of food and fecal waste to minimize odors and prevent
potential health problems for the animals housed in them.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The entire premises is filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash old animal enclosures and fence.
Several other buildings on the property are also filled with old equipment and debris and trash. Tall weed were
present in many area of the facility. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and
numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
The food preparation/ butcher area counter is cluttered with supplies and is very dirty. Butcher knifes still dirty with
blood are on the counter. The cabinet under the counter is rotting away do to a water leak. The room next to the
butcher area is filled with debris. An old cooler right outside the butcher area is overgrown with mold. These
conditions make it impossible to properly clean these areas. Remove all this trash and debris and clean and
sanitize the food preparation area.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Many rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were located in the alleyway for the leopard
row cat enclosures. A rodent hole was noted going under the shelter for the cougar enclosure. A dead and
mummifying mouse was noted inside a food receptacle bin inside the produce cooler. Rodent feces was noted on
shelves inside the warm room. Rodents can be carriers of disease which may be harmful to the animals housed in
these areas. A more effective means of rodent control must be established for the facility.
3.132 CRITICAL REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that despite the reduction in animal numbers that there is a lack of adequately trained employees. The
persistence of multiple animal welfare act violations related to basic animal husbandry issues illustrates this point.
The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can result in facility and animal
conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Prior to the start of the inspection today a member of facility
management stated to the inspectors that she felt the findings on our inspections were not a big deal. It is this
indifference to the basic animal husbandry needs of animals housed at this facility that contributes to the poor
conditions at this facility. Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be added.The inspection was conducted with the facility CEO. An informal exit interview was conducted with the CEO at the
conclusion of the inspection. A formal exit interview was conducted with the CEO on 4-27-17.
The condition of the tiger known as Daisy and the Syrian brown bears is under review by APHIS officials.
