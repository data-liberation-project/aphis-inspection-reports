SANITATION.
- In an outdoor enclosure housing a single kinkajou the area around the entrance to the shelter is covered with
greasy black debris. This appears to be residue from the animal's body which has become "ground into" the
wooden shelter. This is a potential source of contamination and must be cleaned appropriately.
