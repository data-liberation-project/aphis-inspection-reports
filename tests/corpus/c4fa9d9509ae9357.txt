HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On January 7, 2015, three cotton top tamarins were left in an outdoor enclosure overnight. They did not have
access to indoor heated enclosures.The recorded temperature was below freezing and presented a threat to the
animals' health and well being. The exposure to these extreme climate conditions were the cause of death for two of
the tamarins. When weather conditions present a threat to animal's health or well being, appropriate measures must
be taken to alleviate the impact of these conditions. All animals must not be subject to any combination of
temperature or humidity that is detrimental to the animal's health or well being at all times.
To be corrected from this day forward.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of inspection, there were two non human primates being singly housed - a cotton top tamarin and black
tufted ear marmoset. They both had no type of interaction with other non human primates. Non human primates are
encouraged to be housed in social groups to promote the psychological well-being of the primate. Individually
housed non human primates must be able to see and hear one of their own species unless the attending
veterinarian determines that this would endanger their health, safety or well-being.
To be corrected from this day forward.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of inspection, the resting platforms in both the night quarters for the tigers and cougar were in need of
repair and/or replacement. Both indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and be maintained
in good repair to protect the animals.
