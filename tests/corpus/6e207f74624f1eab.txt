3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Five plastic feed receptacles were used to feed 10 adult dogs. These plastic feed receptacles were extremely
chewed along the tops of the feeders.
Two plastic divider boards were excessively chewed and scratched. These two plastic divider boards were located
in the hog barn kennel for two enclosures housing a total of three adult dogs.
These chewed areas can prevent required cleaning and sanitization. This can increase the disease potential for the
dogs.
All hard surfaces must be maintained regularly when worn or soiled. This will allow for required cleaning and
sanitization. Therefore, minimizing the disease potential for the dogs.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Three raised enclosures in the whelping room, housing three adult dogs and 15 puppies, had blankets and carpet
squares for absorbent bedding use. This bedding material had an accumulation of fecal waste. Some of the carpet
pieces had an accumulation of waste smeared into the carpet fibers. The animals had free contact with the soiled
blankets and carpet pieces. The plastic and hog flooring under the bedding had an accumulation of fecal waste on
the surface and smashed down into the holes or the flooring. Contaminated material (bedding) can cause orders,
attract insects and pests and increase disease hazards. The accumulation of waste on hard surfaces can increase
disease hazards to the dogs.
All absorbent bedding must be spot cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals freedom to avoid contact
with excreta. All hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized often to prevent an accumulation of fecalwaste. Spot-cleaning and sanitization will reduce the disease hazards for the animals.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Three raised enclosures in the whelping room, housing two adults and 10 puppies, had gaps in the flooring.
These gaps were between sections of flooring and ranged approximately 1 inch wide to 1 and 11/2 feet long. These
gaps can allow for the dogs feet to pass through possibly causing injury.
All meshed and slatted flooring must be constructed to prevent the dogs(cid:25) feet from passing through. This will
prevent injury to the animals.
