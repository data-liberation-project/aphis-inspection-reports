3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The enclosure housing the alpaca, two goats and two sheep has duct tape
over some of the edges and seams of the small wire mesh attached to the back wood wall to cover the sharp ends
of the wire. Some of the strips of duct tape are detaching from the wire mesh. During the inspection the loose
strips of duct tape were removed to prevent the animals from eating the duct tape and becoming ill. The sharp ends
of the small wire fencing must be covered to prevent the animals from being injured by the wire. The material used
to cover the sharp wire ends must be structurally sound and firmly attached to prevent ingestion by the animals.
