2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11am on
10-OCT-19.
Spoke with the licensee and was told they had prior obligations and were not available for an inspection. I thanked
the licensee for their time and left the facility.
