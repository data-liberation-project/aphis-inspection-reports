2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
No readily identifiable attendant was present during periods of public contact with goats. Unattended interaction with the
animals poses injury and/or disease risks to people and/or the animals. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily
identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. Correct by July 9, 2021.

Facilities, outdoor.
A fallen tree was leaning across the perimeter fence, providing a potential animal escape route from the facility or entry
access to animals from outside the facility. Most of the perimeter fence is covered by vegetation, making it hard to
evaluate its height and strength. Escape by facility inhabitants or entry by outside animals via the perimeter fence poses a
threat to the safety of the animals of the facility. The perimeter fence must by constructed so that it protect the animals in
the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the
animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for animals in the facility. Correct by
