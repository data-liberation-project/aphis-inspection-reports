2.31(e)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC-approved protocol 16-011 listed 27 rabbits to be used on the study. During inspection, 28 rabbits were
assigned to 16-011. It was observed that one rabbit had a cage card labeled 'spare' and that this rabbit had not
received any test article, however the protocol did not list an additional (spare) rabbit. To ensure that animal use is
kept to a minimum, the facility must ensure that studies only use the number of animals as approved by the IACUC
in the protocols. The IACUC and facility must ensure that studies only acquire the amount of animals approved for
each protocol.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
