2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The licensee housed 3 serval kittens at a secondary offsite location for the past 2-3 weeks. The licensee was previously
informed that a new site inspection is required at this secondary property prior to conducting regulated activity there.
Inspection of new sites is important for assuring that housing facilities are appropriate and secure for the animals housed
within, and for ensuring compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by 11/20/22 by notifying USDA in writing about
the presence of all additional locations where regulated animals are housed. No regulated activity may be conducted at
offsite locations until those locations have been inspected and approved by USDA personnel.
2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The program of veterinary care states that the Attending Veterinarian (AV) will visit the property every 2 months. The AV
was contacted and stated that the last time she or one of her colleagues visited the property was over the summer, more
than 5 months ago. The AV stated that she is available to do the site visits and believes they are important, but that the
licensee has not contacted her to schedule site visits. Veterinary care is important for animal health and wellbeing. Site
visits are an important part of veterinary care because they allow the veterinarian to oversee the adequacy of animal


housing and care. Correct by 12/16/22 by scheduling a site visit with the Attending Veterinarian or designee in
accordance with the written program of veterinary care.
2.134

Contingency planning.
At the time of the inspection, the licensee did not have a written contingency plan in place.
A written emergency/contingency plan is required to help ensure animal health and well-being in the event of an
emergency or disaster; without this tool, animals may suffer illness, injury or death due to unpreparedness should an
emergency or disaster strike. The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the
humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster
(one which could reasonably be anticipated and expected to be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the
animals in their possession). The contingency plan must include all of the information and documentation required by the
Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations. Correct by 01/01/23.
3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
4 adult savannah cats are housed in an outdoor enclosure. Each pair of cats has a hard plastic shelter structure, but there
is no bedding in the shelters. The temperatures for the last few nights have been below 50 degrees Fahrenheit (lows in
the 20’s to 40’s overnight), and will be in the 20’s at night over the next few nights. Each shelter structure is placed on an
electric heating pad but there is not bedding in the shelter structures. Adequate shelter structures with bedding are
essential for animal comfort, health, and wellbeing during the cold winter months. Animals without bedding in their shelter
may suffer from stress, discomfort, or frost bite. Correct by 11/17/22 by providing bedding in shelter structures for cats
housed outdoors when temperatures fall below 50 degrees Fahrenheit and by providing additional bedding when
temperatures fall below 35 degrees Fahrenheit.


3.126(b) Repeat

Facilities, indoor.
A strong ammonia odor was noted by the inspector upon entry into the facility. The odor stayed strong throughout the
inspection in all areas of the facility. The ammonia odor was especially strong in the office where the hedgehogs are
housed. Ammonia is a gas that causes irritation to the eyes, mucus membranes and the lungs of both humans and
animals. Insufficient cleaning of enclosures and poor ventilation combined can lead to buildup of the ammonia gas which
can negatively affect the health and comfort of the animals. Correct by ensuring that indoor housing facilities are
adequately ventilated to provide for the health and comfort of the animals at all times.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
Numerous plastic totes containing 1-2 adult hedgehogs each were very dirty. The floors of the totes were covered with
wood shavings that were completely wet with water, urine, and feces. The walls of the totes had areas where brown waxy
material was caked on them. There was a strong ammonia odor coming from the totes. The store manager stated that the
totes were cleaned once a week and that these totes had been cleaned approximately 1 week ago. Enclosure cleanliness
is important for keeping animals healthy. Enclosures that are dirty can cause animals to get sick from the build up of
feces, soiled bedding, uneaten food, and germs in the enclosure. Bedding that is wet can cause foot problems such as
infection. Correct by ensuring that animal enclosures are cleaned often enough and thoroughly enough to prevent the
build up of feces, contaminated bedding, uneaten food, and to reduce odors.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
There is a large amount of rodent droppings in the office/hedgehog breeding room under the water heater. The store
manager stated that there are about 3 feeder rodents that are currently loose in the store. There are also a large number


of fruit flies in the totes housing hedgehogs. Pests such as rodents and fruit flies can spread diseases that can be harmful
to animal health. Pests can also contaminate stored food and bedding. Correct by 12/01/22 by establishing and
maintaining a safe and effective program for the control of pests.
