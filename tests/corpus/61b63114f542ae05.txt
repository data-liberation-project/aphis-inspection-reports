ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b)
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:20 a.m. on
06/16/2014.
I arrived at the facility at 10:20 a.m. and knocked on the door a couple of times and waited for about 5 minutes, no
one came to the door. I called both of the phone numbers that were provided by the licensee, there was not an
answer at either number, and I left a message on the cell phone. While waiting in the driveway the licensee called
me back and stated that she was on her way to work and was not going to be able to meet with me to perform and
inspection.
The licensee was not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations and standards
and to ensure for the health and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be made available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this date forward.
