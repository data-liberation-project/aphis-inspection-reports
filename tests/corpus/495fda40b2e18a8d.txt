2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 7:55-9:15 am
on 03/30/2015.
No vehicle was in the yard so inspectors honked the horn of the GOV, called the phone number of the licensee two
times with no answer and waited in the yard for 1 hour and 20 minutes.
Additional Inspectors
Hicks Beverly, Animal Care Inspector
