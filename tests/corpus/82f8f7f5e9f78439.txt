2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** There were two rabbits (H-721 and D-193) with eye conditions and one rabbit (D-374) with excessive drainage on
the right side of its face. Rabbit (D-193) had an opaque white appearance with a disturbed surface covering its right
eye. This rabbit died on November 6, 2015 before receiving any veterinary care. The second rabbit (H-721) has a
whitish-yellow crust and substance draining from the left eye which is barely opening. Rabbit (D-374) had excessive
drainage from the right eye and the skin beneath the hair appears reddened with a crusty brown substance around
the edges.
These conditions were noted at the previous inspection and has yet to receive veterinary care which was stated by
the staff. One animal has already died and to avoid any further discomfort, pain and/or deaths these animals need
to be seen by a veterinarian immediately. A mechanism for direct & frequent caretaker communication is required
so that timely information about the animals health may be conveyed to the attending veterinarian and the animals
can receive treatment as expeditiously as possible.
This was a focused inspection on the veterinary care of the animals.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the Animal Caretaker.
