Handling of animals.
A video aired about November or December 2020 showed that in an interview, a young jaguar, Cora, (stated in the video
to be 50-60#) was present and leashed. At one point in the interview, she climbed on the interviewer and chewed on his
shoe before getting pulled back.
While the interview was held in a closed park with no other members of the public present, the interviewer is a member of
the public and must be protected as such. Handling of animals during public exhibition must ensure the safety of the
animal and the public. It has been determined that cats of Nora's size are too large to safely allow for public contact.
Correct by no longer allowing such public contact from this point forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
