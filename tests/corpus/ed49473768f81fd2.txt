ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are several animals in the park with thinning hair. In the large goat pen there is a black female goat with a
large bald patch on her left hind leg in the stifle area. The edge of the patch is raw and bleeding. There is a brown
female goat with very thin/patchy hair covering the majority of her left side and there are thin patches on her legs as
well. The black and white billy goat in the same enclosure has a bald patch on his right side in the abdominal
region. This area was noted in the records last year. It was treated and appears to have healed. This goat now
has thinning hair on his left side.
The white pig that is allowed to remain loose in the park has severe hair loss on her back and sides. The skin in
this area is pink, shiny, and peeling.
There is a young doe in the deer pen that is extremely thin. The ridges of her spine and vertebra are easily visible
and the flank appears to be sunken. We observed a second doe in the pen that is thin. There are 25 deer in the
pen. We were not able to observe all of them but of the 25 we were able to closely observe the ones that came to
the front of the pen.
The geriatric bear "Mandy" was documented in the past as being arthritic. She was recumbent during the inspection
so we were unable to see her walking but noted that she does not appear to be grooming herself. Records
reviewed did not indicate what her current health status is and the owner stated that she has not been receiving any
medication since September of last year. Her current health status should be assessed by the veterinarian.
At the time of this inspection the veterinarian had not been notified of these animals conditions. Abnormal
conditions and health problems should be noted during daily observations and the veterinarian should be notified in
a timely manner to assure the animals receive appropriate care and treatment. The veterinarian shall be notified of
these animals' conditions and they shall be treated accordingly.
The veterinarian was contacted by end of the inspection.
3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
***The welded wire fence surrounding the hay feeder in the sheep enclosure has wires that have separated. The
wires have sharp points which may cause injury. The hay rack shall be repaired or replaced to prevent injury.
***In the pig enclosure that holds the one large black and white pig, there is a fence support post that is no longer
stable in the ground but loose to the touch and provides no support. The fence is not structurally sound and will not
prevent the pig from escaping or another animal from gaining access.
***In the bear enclosure containing 4 fully grown bear, there are large holes dug in the ground. One of these holes
is directly under one of the legs to the ladder used by the bears to climb up to higher levels within the enclosure.
The hole under the leg of the ladder leaves it unstable and unsafe, creating the opprortunity for injury.
***The roof of the fox housing has broken and jagged tin. This is an injury hazard for the animal.
***The red blind fence, along the rear of the llama enclosure, housing two animals, is raised too high off the ground.
The gap between the ground and the fence leaves an area large enough for other animals to gain access to the
enclosure.
***The chain link fencing around the llamas, is in disrepair. It has areas of broken and jagged wires protruding. This
is a safety hazard for the animals.
***On the ramp to the tower created for the goats, there are several broken slats of wood that are loose or pushed
aside. This may allow the goats to become injured if they should fall from the tower.
*** There is a large hole in the wire by the water spickett and exposed nails within the barn type shelter with the
sheep and goats. The barn type housing area has one supporting post that is chewed and worn at the bottom,
providing no support, and creating an injury hazard for the sheep and goats.
***All of the fenced areas of the facility containing the llamas, goats, sheep, and pigs have eroded areas around the
bottom of the fencing. These areas are being filled with large rocks, boards, and other materials to cover the gaps
between the fence and ground. This method, with the recent rain, is not effective in creating a safe enviroment for
the animals. All of these areas need to be reworked with a plan to create a safe enviroment for all the animals
concerned.
Facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals securely.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(c) Drainage
***The pig enclosures that have dirt floors, do not provide any dry surface area for the pigs during extensive rain.
The only dry area was observed in the pigs primary housing. The pigs were observed sinking down into the mud
while walking around the pen with no dry area to stand or lay if they want to get out of the mud. Although pigs enjoy
mud they must have dry surfaces as well. Constant exposure to wet, soggy ground can lead to disease and illness.
Proper drainage must be provided to efficiently remove excess water to prevent the muddy conditions and provide
for the health and well being of the pigs.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted by Brenda Pietrosante, ACI, and Michelle Williams, VMO, with the
facility President.
