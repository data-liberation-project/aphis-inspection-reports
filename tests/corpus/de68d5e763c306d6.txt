ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A litter of eight Weimaraner puppies born on 06/04/19 were undersized for their age and underweight. They were
lethargic and had many ticks on them. All of the puppies were thin with three of the puppies having visible ribs and
hip bones. One of these puppies was extremely weak, had difficulty standing, and had visible shoulder and
vertebral bones. The puppies were housed in an outdoor enclosure. The puppies had not received any type of
supplemental nutrition or husbandry. A veterinarian had not been consulted about their condition. Appropriate
veterinary care is necessary to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease, malnutrition, and parasites.
***An adult female Weimaraner named "Daisy" (m/c 941000014976966) had ticks covering most of its body. Many
of the ticks were engorged. A veterinarian had not been consulted about treating and controlling this severe
parasite problem.
The licensee must take the three thinnest puppies to a veterinarian on July 09, 2019 for diagnosis and follow the
treatment plan for all eight puppies. The licensee must consult a veterinarian regarding appropriate external
parasite control for the adult dog by July 10, 2019.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
A litter of eight Weimaraner puppies born on June 04, 2019, were whelped and maintained in an outdoor enclosure. All eight puppies were undersized and underweight, with one puppy being so weak it had trouble standing and
walking. The ambient temperature at the time of the inspection was 92 degrees F. The puppies were lethargic,
moved very little, and were panting. The Attending Veterinarian had written "N/A" on the licensee's Program of
Veterinary Care under Non-Climate Control Whelping. Young and sick puppies have difficulty acclimating to
temperature extremes. The licensee must ensure that sick, infirm, aged, and young dogs are not housed outdoors
unless the practice is specifically approved by the Attending Veterinarian.
These dogs must be moved to a climate-controlled building on July 09, 2019.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were excessively tall weeds and grasses in the enclosures for the Weimaraners and Bernese Mtn. Dogs. Tall
weeds and grasses provide habitat for pests such as ticks, fleas, and snakes. The licensee must ensure that weeds
and grasses are controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control.
To be corrected by July 10, 2019.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
An adult female Weimaraner had ticks covering most of its body. A litter of eight Weimaraner puppies had ticks on
their abdomens and chests. Ticks can result in anemia and can carry diseases that can affect the health of the
dogs. The licensee must establish an effective pest control program for the dogs and for the premises.
