2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 on
11-DEC-17.
Two of the facility employees stated that the owner was not available for inspection, and that no other authorized
facility representative was available for inspection at that time. Without access to conduct the inspection, the
regulatory process is impossible. Licensees must ensure a knowledgeable facility representative is available to
accompany an inspection during normal business hours. Correct from this time forward.
