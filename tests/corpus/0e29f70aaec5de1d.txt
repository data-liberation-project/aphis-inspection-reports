2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The vaccines the licensee currently has on hand for the dogs are stored inside a refrigerator. The temperature inside the
refrigerator is 52 degrees F according to the inspector's Kestrel. The label on the vaccinations states they should be
stored between 35-46 degrees F. Storing vaccinations at inappropriate temperatures may affect their ability to protect
against serious and deadly diseases.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must store the vaccines within the temperature range on the label. The licensee must also ensure that all medical
products are properly stored at all times.

Compatible grouping.
One 12-week-old male puppy is being housed with an approximately 2-year-old adult male. Housing puppies with adult
dogs that are not the dam could cause incompatibility which may result in injury to the puppy should the adult become
aggressive. Incompatible housing may also result in the failure of the puppy to access food and water should the adult

exhibit resource guarding behaviors.

Puppies 4 months of age or less may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs other than their dams
or foster dams. The licensee may house the 12-week-old puppy alone or with pen mates that meet the compatibility
requirements. The licensee must ensure that each dog is compatibly housed at all times in order to support their health
and well-being.

To be corrected by: The licensee moved the puppy into compatible housing at the time of the inspection.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete and the vaccination information for adult dogs is missing. The vaccination
schedule and which diseases are vaccinated against is not listed in the Program of Veterinary Care. The licensee stated
that he currently vaccinates the dogs annually for Bordetella, Distemper, Rabies, Canine Adenovirus Type 2, Canine
Parainfluenza, and Parvovirus. Failure to document the vaccination information may interfere with the ability of APHIS
officials to determine if the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete and the schedule for deworming the adult dogs is missing. The licensee
stated that the adult female dogs are dewormed at least twice while raising their litters of puppies. All newly acquired
dogs are dewormed upon arriving at the facility, and adult dogs without litters of puppies are dewormed twice a year.
Failure to document the schedule for deworming may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to determine if the dogs
are receiving adequate veterinary care.


Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care that is developed, documented in writing, and signed
by the attending veterinarian and must include vaccinations for contagious and deadly diseases of dogs and sampling and
treatment of parasites in accordance with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian. The licensee must add the
missing information for vaccinating and deworming the adult dogs to the Program of Veterinary Care. The licensee must
ensure the Program of Veterinary Care is complete and addresses all requirements for adequate veterinary care.

Veterinary care for dogs.
One adult dog is currently under veterinary care and receiving treatment for an eye condition, but no documentation exists
containing the treatment plan. Failure to document the treatment plan may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to
determine if the animal is receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer must keep copies of medical records that includes the date and description of the problem, examination
findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed. The licensee must complete a
medical record for the dog which contains the treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all medical records are
complete and contain all required information.

Veterinary care for dogs.

The licensee has been deworming and vaccinating the litters of puppies but has not been recording the dates of these
administrations. Failure to record the date of administrations of vaccinations and deworming could interfere with the
ability of APHIS officials to determine if the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer must keep copies of medical records that include the dates of administration of vaccinations and treatments.
The licensee must document the dates each time a vaccination or deworming is administered. The licensee must ensure
that medical records are complete and contain all required information at all times.
