ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:50am on
02-Oct-19.
I arrived at the facility, knocked on the door and called out. I then called the phone number provided twice and
received no answer. I waited 30 minutes at the facility and then left.
