ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1322 on
08-Nov-17. The husband was working outside when I pulled up in the driveway. He informed me his wife was the
primary person that conduced the inspections. She was not home and would not be home until later that evening. I
informed him we would try back another time.
End of report.
