ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00AM on
12-JUN-17.
Inspector knocked at the door at the animal facility address and received no answer. The inspector waited 30 min in
the driveway of the facility. A phone attempt was made at that time, but due to limited cellular reception there was
no voicemail left. The inspector then drove to the Licensee's residence address and knocked on the door and
received no answer. The inspector then called both phone-numbers on file again and left a message for a return call
on the Licensee's cellphone. The inspector waited 30 minutes in the driveway of the residence before leaving the
area.
