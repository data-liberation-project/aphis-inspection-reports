2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs were noted to have veterinary care issues requiring veterinary attention. The first dog was a black and
white female Boston Terrier named "Peanut" (microchip ID # 900164000675142) located at the first location. The
dog has a white circular spot in the center of its eye. The licensee stated the dog has had this condition for a year
and was previously treated by the Attending Veterinarian, however it appears that the dog's eye has a condition that
is currently active and may need further evaluation by the Attending Veterinarian. Untreated eye conditions can
cause pain and may be contagious to other animals.
The second dog was a female Chihuahua (microchip ID # 075-003-534) located at the second location. The dog
had a thick layer of brown tartar on its teeth. Tartar on the teeth can lead to an infection.
The Attending Veterinarian must be consulted with and both dogs must be treated per the Veterinarian's
instructions.
Multiple vials of canine distemper vaccine at the second location were found to have expired on 3-14-17. Expired
medications doesn't ensure that the products are safe to use. All expired products must be discarded.
Note: The home location and temporary location were both inspected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
