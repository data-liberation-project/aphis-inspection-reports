2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:55 AM on
10-OCT-18.
Upon arrival at the facility, I knocked on the door and rang the doorbell of the house located at the facility site. I
called Mr. Roy's primary phone number at 10:55 AM, and I left a message, then waited at the site for several
minutes. I located and then called another phone number listed for Mr. Wilbur, left a message, and then spoke with
him when he returned my call. Mr. Wilbur was unable to meet me at the facility. I inquired whether a neighbor, a
family member, or a person living in the on-site home could potentially accompany me for an inspection, yet Mr.
Wilbur conveyed none of those options were feasible at this time. We discussed the value of identifying optimal
hours for conducting inspections. After our call, I left the facility.
