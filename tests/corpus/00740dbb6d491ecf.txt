2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a new attending veterinarian under part time contract because the full time veterinarian resigned.
In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian, formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary
care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several medications and suture material were expired as follows:
1- 2 boxes of Epinephrine
2- 1 bag NaCl
3- 1 box of suture material
4- 1 bag of 5% dextrose
5- 2 vials of clostridium vaccines
6- 1 bottle of imodium
The use of expired materials and medications is considered adulterated and is not an appropriate method to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. An effective method to insure that expire medication are
removed should be established.
The refrigerator that is use to store medications had dirt, frozen and liquid condensate. This method of storage does
not minimize possible contamination of these products.
The cougar was observed to be pacing and panting. These behaviors were observed while directly observing the
animal and after we moved to inspect other nearby enclosures. This cougar is being housed in a small enclosure
which only offers minimal amount of space to make species appropriate behaviors. This cougar appears to be
exhibiting distress or an underlying veterinary care condition.
One of the tigers is thin. This tiger currently is under observation but has not received any laboratory or other
tests/examinations since 2015. These two animals must be completely evaluated by the new attending veterinarian.3.75(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure in the island where the spider monkeys are located needs to repaired or replaced the metal gates
and metal bars which are rusted and at the same time it should be cleaned and painted.
Rust may compromise the structural strength of the gates and metal bars located within the enclosure.
To be corrected by 3-13-2017.
3.75(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The area around the baboon enclosure had accumulation of waste water, old food and a considerable amount of
flies was observe on the food. The accumulation of waste water and old food provides an excellent area for
mosquito and biting fly reproduction which can also cause additional stress,pain & irritations to the primates.
Housing facilities must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes,
bedding, dead animals, debris, garbage, water, and any other fluids and wastes, in a manner that minimizes
contamination and disease risk.
To be corrected by 3-13-2017.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The lion exhibit previously had "hot wire grass" along the border of the enclosure facing the moat which was
removed. The zoo personnel were unaware of its removal until the inspection of this area.
Lions were observed walking on top of the moat wall and standing on top of the rock work inside the enclosure
looking towards a sable antelope standing on the other side of the moat.
There was no hot wire to deter the lions from trying to jump into the moat to get to the antelope.
If a lion should fall into the moat, it could injure itself or, could try to climb and enter the antelope exhibit.
The ocelot exhibit had a tree limb used for enrichment that was rotted Termite tunnels were observed on the back
wall towards the upper portion of the tree limb in this exhibit which may be contributing to the deteriorated wood that
was observed.
The tree limb poses a threat of injury to the animal exhibited because it is no longer structurally sound to support the
weight of this cat.
Th camel/deer/aoudad exhibit had and area where the shelter roof & gutters were full of leaves, ferns, dirt, etc,
which is now clogging the drainage system. This also puts extra weight on the gutters (as well as the roofs) and
can potentially fall on top of the animals if they are in this area. The lack of proper gutter drainage that is observed is
contributing to the mud and standing water directly below these gutters.There was also erosion in this area which exposed the chain link along the ground creating spaces and gaps which
could entrap animals walking close to the fence.
There was water leaking from the roof in the feed and hay storage area in the camel/deer/aoudad barn which could
be a source of food contamination. Water was observed on the floor an on top of a food container and it was
dripping from the roof.
The metal fasteners used to secure the lower portion of the chain link fence on the sable antelope enclosure were
detached at the bottom along the service road in some areas. The gap observed could also be an entrapment for
the antelope in this enclosure.
To be corrected by 3-13-2017.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Standing water and mud accumulations were observed in several enclosures (rhino, aoudad, camels, etc.)
The animals had to walk through mud to go into the shelter, and their lower legs and hooves were observed to have
mud accumulations.
Mud and moist conditions in the hoof and skin may cause bacterial infections and other irritations leading to
lameness, pain, &/or stress of the affected animals.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence was down in some areas along the road near the camel exhibit due to tree falls.
The fence must be constructed and maintain in good repair so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting
animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the
facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
To be corrected by 3-13-2017.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
There was some boxes of meat inside the freezer under the condenser unit with ice condensation on top of them.
Ice condensate may contaminate the food use to feed the animals.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination.
To be corrected by 3-13-2017.3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The water in the Hippo exhibit was cloudy and algae was observed on the rock work in the middle of the pool.
In order to keep the water clean a water filtration system shall be installed or more frequent water changes and
washing should be instituted as necessary to maintain this pool in a clean fashion at all times.
There was a strong smell of urine in the ocelot/puma area which can indicate that more frequent cleaning should be
performed in order to eliminate the strong urine odor in this area.
To be corrected by 3-13-2017.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The premises around the commissary had empty food boxes, discarded food, etc. which may attract pest.
Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the
animals.
The unused chute in the zebra/impala exhibit is in disrepair. Animals have direct access to the chute and its
mechanisms. This may be a possible area of entrapment or injury.
The roof of the veterinary clinic is leaking and the ceiling panels were water stained and moldy including the area
directly above the surgical table which would expose any animal undergoing surgery to an increased risk of
infections. The surgical room should be as sterile and clean as possible.
Buildings shall be maintained in good repair to facilitate the prescribed husbandry & veterinary practices.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was multiple rat bait boxes inspected throughout the zoo hat didn't contain any rat bait.
Termites tunnels were observed in multiple areas and enclosures which eat wood and compromises the strength of
the affected wood.
A safe and more effective rat control program shall be established and maintained in order to prevent food
contamination and spread of diseases transmitted by rats and to control the spread of termites around the zoo
areas.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
