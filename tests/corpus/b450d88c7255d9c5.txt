WATERING.
The armadillo water receptacle was excessively dirty and muddy at time of this inspection. The licensee cleaned it
immediately and offered the animal clean water.
Corrected at time of inspection.
The water bottle for the two prairie dogs housed in the metal trough was knocked down and buried in their hay. The
licensee found the bottle and re-installed it. The holder for the water bottle is not structurally sound for the size and
weight of the bottle and a new holder is needed to keep this from occurring.
Corrected at time of inspection.
The exit briefing was conducted with the President.
