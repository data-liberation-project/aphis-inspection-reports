ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Samoyed (Microchip # 151336624A) has a wound on the back left foot. The wound is approximately 1 inch
long and is located along the top aspect of the foot. The hair around the wound appears wet and discolored with a
red-brown tinged fluid. The area around the wound is mildly red and swollen. The dog does not appear to be
limping. Untreated wounds can lead to further medical complications and can cause unnecessary pain and distress
for the animal. The animal listed above must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,
including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the
inspector upon request.
There is an opened, but nearly full, bag of Deccox (0.5% Decoquinate) located within the feed room. The licensee
states that she places this medication on the feed for her dogs. The product is labeled for cattle and neither the
product nor the program of veterinary care contain instructions for using this product on dogs. Improper use of
veterinary drugs can be detrimental to the health of the animals. Medications not approved for use in dogs requires
veterinary approval and oversight. The product, dose and route of administration should be documented and
followed according to the veterinarians directions. The information on all medications used on the animals, including
product, dose and route of administration, should be documented and made available to the inspectors upon
request in order to ensure that the methods and drugs used to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and
injuries is appropriate.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Condition and site.
The food storage area is cluttered with various items (unused husbandry equipment such as heat lamps, cabinets,
and lumber). There is an accumulation of straw bedding, dust, dirt and/or debris on the unused items and on the
floor around the feed bags. There is also an open bag of feed next to the unopened feed bags on the pallet that is
not in a sealed container.
This can attract pests and provide a place for rodents to nest and breed. The licensee must ensure areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash,
waste material, junk and other discarded materials. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and
free of clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored material, but may contain materials actually used and
necessary for cleaning the area, and fixtures or equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
The surface of the wooden flooring in the occupied outdoor enclosures is worn and absorbing liquid. Inside the
wooden shelters being used there are areas of chewed, scratched and worn surfaces. The paint is also peeling in
areas and exposing unsealed wood. There are two wind and rain break flaps on two shelters that are damaged and
fraying.
The worn surfaces cannot be properly clean and sanitized. This can create a disease hazard and affect the health
and well being of the dogs. The licensee must maintain all surfaces in the housing facility on a regular basis.
Surfaces of housing facilities including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility
that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
All of the enclosures within the outdoor housing facility, containing 25 dogs, have an excessive build-up of fur,
excreta and/or soiled bedding within the enclosures. The West green-colored enclosures, containing five dogs, has
an accumulation of wet and soiled straw bedding, feces and/or debris within the shelters. Plastic food receptacles
attached to the enclosures, that are not being used, contain soiled bedding and stagnant water which the dogs have
access to. There is more than a day worth of animal waste that has accumulated along the edges of nearly all of the
enclosures that are on the ground.
Not cleaning and removing animal waste daily can create disease hazards and affects the health and well-being of
the dogs. All enclosures must be spot cleaned daily to remove excreta, soiled bedding, food waste, hair, etc. from
the floor, wire fencing, and inside of shelters.3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
Nearly all of outside runs have an excessive amount of excreta, food waste, hair, old bedding and standing water
surrounding the enclosures. The large amount of waste is immediately adjacent to the enclosures and there are a
large number of flies present around these areas. The licensee must have an effective drainage system and remove
the waste from around the enclosures and maintain the collection of waste to minimize odors, pest, disease hazards
and to contribute to the health and well-being of the animals.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The South outdoor enclosure containing two adult Samoyed dogs has a hole in the coated wire flooring
approximately 3 inches in diameter. The wire is broken and bent creating sharp points the dogs can come into
contact with.
This can create a hazardous situation for the dogs. The licensee must ensure all sharp points within the enclosures
are repaired or replaced in a manner that eliminates the bent and broken wires and protects the dog from injury.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control.
An excessive number of flies are present in and around all of the outdoor enclosures affecting 25 dogs. Pest control
products are present, however, they are not being maintained which is reducing the effectiveness of the program.
Flies are clustered on the heads of two adult rottweilers. The dogs are shaking their heads and pawing at the areas
where the flies are located. An excessive number of pests can lead to disease hazards. An effective program for the
control of insects and external parasites affecting dogs must be established and maintained so as to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
