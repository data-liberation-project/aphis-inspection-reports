FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The climbing structure that is in the larger of the two goat enclosures housing seven goats was observed to have
some rotting and missing boards as well as exposed nails. Approximately over half the boards on the structure have
been replaced however, there are still several areas in need of repair. Structures that are not properly maintained
could cause injury to the animals. The climbing structure must be maintained so that it is structurally sound and free
of sharp points and rotting and missing boards.
