Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On December 5, 2018, 3 rabbits were used in a skin irritation study. The scientist assigned to prepare the test article did
not dilute it as prescribed protocol’s special instructions. The test article should have had 1:64 dilution. The solution was
applied to the rabbit’s skin and the skin was wrapped at 10:49AM as prescribed in the protocol. During a skin check at
3:37PM, the animal care technician noted signs of edema and erythema. At 4:05PM the rabbits were provided with
analgesics. Twenty-four hours after the application of the solution the rabbits were euthanized due to levels of edema
and erythema of the skin.

Personnel conducting procedures on the species being maintained or studied will be appropriately qualified and trained in
those procedures.

This was corrected by the facility by retraining the scientist and the addition protocol coversheets that highlight special test
article instructions.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
