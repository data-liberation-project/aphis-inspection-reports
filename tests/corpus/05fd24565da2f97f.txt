SANITATION.
There was not a pest control program in the dry food storage room at the time of inspection. One of the pelleted
feed bags had a hole likely chewed by vermin. An abundance of mouse feces was observed adjacent to the this
and other food bags. Vermin can carry and spread disease.
Establish, implement, and maintain an effective program for the control of vermin.
