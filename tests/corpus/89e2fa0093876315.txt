RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Official USDA dog on hand sheets (7005's) need to be updated. There are 26 additional dogs listed that are no
longer at the facility. When the records and the dogs currently at the facility don't match it makes the records
inaccurate. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty
and to facilitate the ability to trace dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all
times at their facility.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
