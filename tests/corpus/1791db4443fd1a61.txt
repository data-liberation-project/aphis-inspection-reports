2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
- Study and quarantine animals are not being attended over weekends. The facility policy defines working days as
weekdays only. Animals are provided food and water to last them through the weekend, but there is no one
observing or checking them during this time. On the daily observation records the weekends were dated and
marked
NA. I asked the facility represenatitive who NA was and he stated that no one came in on the weekends and the
technician would mark those days as NA and date the form. Each research facility shall have a person providing
daily
observation of all animals to access their health and well being. The observation may be done by a person other
than
the attendng veterinarian as long as there is direct and frequent communication so timely and accurate information
on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.(cid:9)
