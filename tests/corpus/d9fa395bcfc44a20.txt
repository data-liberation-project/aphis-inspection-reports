Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Five goats in the petting zoo public display area were noted to be significantly lame on observation during inspection.
1. One mature mostly white doe was toe-touch lame on the right hind leg.
2. One mature brown doe’s black kid was toe-touch lame on the right rear leg.
3. One mature mostly black doe with a white splash on left flank and white left rear leg was toe-touch lame on the right
front leg.
4. Her mostly black kid was toe-touch lame on the right front leg.
5. One mature doe, mostly black with white splash on right flank was toe-touch lame on the right front leg.

The facility had not identified these five lame animals prior to this inspection, indicating that daily observations had not
been properly conducted that morning. Daily observations typically occur in the morning when the owner does his daily
observations and/or the staff are feeding the animals, per conversation with the facility owner. Goats that had been noted
lame on prior daily observations had been removed from the display and had received treatment per the Attending
Veterinarian (AV). Per phone conversation with the AV, the AV stated that she had not been notified of these five lame
animals and no corrective actions for these five animals had been initiated prior to this inspection.



Upon observation by the owner during this inspection, the animals were removed from public display and placed in a
heavily-bedded stall for AV consultation later that same day. Upon the inspectors’ return to the facility on 3/31/2021, it
was confirmed that the AV had been consulted and treatment for all impacted animals had been initiated per the AV's
direction on 3/30/2021.

The lack of adequate daily observations and subsequent communications to the AV can result in increased periods of
pain and suffering in untreated animals.

Daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being and a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication are required, so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-
being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct by 4/1/2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
