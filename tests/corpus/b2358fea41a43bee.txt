2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review in the stock shed (young replacement breeders) and
in building # 2. A total of 1828 guinea pigs were counted during this inspection including 223 in the stock building, 987 in
building # 1, and 618 in building # 2. There were no inventory records indicating the number of adults, weanlings, or
newborns present for the last few months in the stock shed and building # 2. Failure to maintain these records can make it
difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by deaths or deceased number of animals born and
to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care and use. The facility must maintain records
containing the required information which fully and correctly disclose the number of animals held, owned, and acquired or
disposed of including births and deaths.

Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
