FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The back of the metal shelter at the campground location has a hole in it with jagged metal edges protruding out
from it. Sharp edges could potentially injure any of the animals that come into contact with it. The shelter needs to
be repaired or replaced so no sharp points are sticking out. Correct by 7/6/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee by phone.
Note: This was a focused inspection at the campground location. The licensee was not available for inspection at
the home location. All records are kept at the home location. Therefore, no records were reviewed during this
inspection.
