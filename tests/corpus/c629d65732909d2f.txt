and the health of the animal may suffer. Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries. The facility must ensure medical products have an accurate expiration date at all times. The
facility discarded the medical products at the time of inspection.

Housing facilities, general.
There is 1 inch by 1 inch plastic coated wire added to the caging bars of an enclosure housing 3 adult King Charles
Spaniels. The wire is in disrepair and has at least 3 sharp points at least 2 inches long that are at the dog's eye level. The

is kept in good repair and is safe for the dogs.
