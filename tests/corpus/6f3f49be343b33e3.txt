SANITATION.
**Two rabbit enclosures have soiled bedding and an accumulation of fecal material. Excessive accumulation of fecal
material and soiled bedding can increase risk of disease. The enclosures should be cleaned and maintained in a
manner to prevent an accumulation of fur and soiled bedding in order to protect the rabbits from contamination and
disease.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
**Excessive amounts of mud was noted in several stalls housing numerous animals in the south pole barn. In
several of the stalls the animals have to walk through the muddy areas in order to access food and/or water.
Animal areas should be free of excess water and mud in order to prevent disease and health issues. Areas housing
animals should have adequate drainage to eliminate excess water that can lead to mud which can harbor pests and
promote disease.
