2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The Program of Veterinary Care is not being followed as written and approved by the attending veterinarian. The PVC
states that hoofstock will be dewormed monthly however the animals are being dewormed every 3 months. The PVC
must be followed as established, if changes are to be made, these must be consulted and approved by the attending
veterinarian and a new PVC completed reflecting these changes.
2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A ring tail lemur individually housed has hair loss on both front limbs. The hair loss was first noticed by the licensee in
spring of 2021 when the animal was housed with another lemur. The animal has since then been housed alone. No
observations of overgrooming have been reported by the licensee or care takers. The attending veterinarian has not
assessed the animal nor has been consulted regarding the hair loss of the ring tail lemur. The enclosure has stuffed
animals, perches, and toys for enrichment. The licensee failed to provide adequate veterinary care to an animal that has
been observed showing hair loss for a long period of time. The attending veterinarian must be consulted to determine the
adequate diagnostic and treatment plan.



A two-toed sloth has overgrown claws. One of the hind limbs claws is curled inward to the point that the animal was
noticed unable to use the claw when climbing. Sloth's claws are vital as it helps the animal perform species specific
behavior such as hanging upside down. Overgrown claws can impede the animal movement and from climbing structures
and feeding. The animal needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to determine treatment.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records of disposition for the following animals were not provided during this inspection:
- Patagonian Cavy
- Alpaca
Acquisition and disposition records are required so that animals being used in regulated activities can be accurately
tracked to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation. Animals transferred to or acquired from
other licensee must have disposition and acquisition records containing all information required by the Animal Welfare Act
regulations available for inspection. This requirement applies to all regulated animals purchased or otherwise acquired,
owned, held, leased or otherwise in possession of or under control of the licensee, and all regulated animals transported,
sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any
animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.
3.75(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
A cat tree multiplatform kept inside a ring tail lemur enclosure for enrichment is worn out. The fur covering the tree
multiplatform has been chewed up by the ring tail lemur. Furniture type fixtures must be constructed in a manner and
made of material that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn and soiled.


Furniture-type fixtures or objects must be sturdily constructed and must be strong enough to provide for the safe activity
and welfare of non-human primates.
3.78(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The shelters provided for five adult ring tail lemurs housed in outdoor facilities are inadequate. The shelters are made of
wooden boxes fixed to the top of the enclosure. There is no heat source inside the shelter boxes and no device available
to measure the temperature inside. A heat lamp placed outside the shelter box and facing the opening of the box is the
only heat source provided for the animals but cannot prevent the ambient temperature from falling below 45F. Cold
temperatures can cause frost bites and can be detrimental to the health of the animal. Outdoor housing facilities for non-
human primates must provide adequate shelter from the elements at all times and must safely provide heat to the non-
human primates to prevent the ambient temperature from falling below 45F.
3.81

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The environment enhancement plan developed is not being followed and is not adequate to promote the psychological
well-being of non-human primates. The plan states that only young primates are singly housed indoor with daily human
contact. This is not being followed as an adult ring tail lemur is individually housed in an outdoor enclosure. The plan
also fails to provide specific details for certain abnormal behaviors such as overgrooming. Currently, the singly housed
ring tail lemur suffers from hair loss suspected to be caused by overgrooming. There should be specific details on how
they are managing the overgrooming with the guidance from the attending veterinarian. The plan also states that hands
on encounters or private shows are considered enrichment for the primates. This is not in accordance with currently
accepted professional standards as their job should not be used as enrichment because the animals are expected to


perform whether they want to or not. Enrichment is for the benefit of the animal and should be something they fully have
the option to whether engage or not.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
One of the two shelters available inside an outdoor enclosure housing 3 kangaroos is not maintained in good repair. The
shelter is made of stainless-steel panels that are rusty and have jagged edges. All enclosures must be kept in good
repair, free of sharp points, protruding edges, and gaps/openings in order to protect the animals from injury.
The fence of the shelter area inside an outdoor enclosure housing farm animals and 1 camel and 1 deer is not structurally
sound and in good repair. One side of the shelter area is enclosed by an approximately 4 feet chain link fence with T
posts and mesh wire connecting all the way to the roof. One part of the fence does not have a T post and is leaning
outward, and it has loose wires. The facility needs to repair the fence and mesh wire to avoid any injury to the animals
sheltered therein. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animal
involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
An adult male warthog is kept in an outdoor housing facility that is not enclosed by a perimeter fence. The primary
enclosure is made of an approximately 5 feet chain link and hog wire fence. Lack of a perimeter fence does not allow for
second containment in the case of escape and allows other animals and the public easy access to the animal. All outdoor
housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized
persons out. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals, such as but not limited to, large felines,


bears, wolves, rhinoceros, and elephants, or less than 6 feet high for other animals must be approved in writing by the
Administrator.
3.130

Watering.
The metal water trough inside a warthog enclosure has dark brown buildup material on the sides and at the bottom. The
water trough was almost empty and there was a water puddle right next to it. Two sides of the water trough have been
bent inwards and the licensee indicates that the warthog often flips over the water trough to make a mud bath. The water
trough is not fixed to any surface making it easier to be flipped by the warthog and soil material getting in and
contaminating the water. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
3.131

Sanitation.
An outdoor enclosure housing 3 adult pigs and 1 adult sheep and the shelter area of an outdoor enclosure housing farm
animals, 1 camel and 1 deer had roughly 80% of the enclosure with fecal accumulation to the point that there was little
space for the animals to walk without having to step on their own feces. The animals had to go through feces to get to
water, shelter and food. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contain therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
