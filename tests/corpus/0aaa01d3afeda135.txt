serviced 12/14, and due for service 12/15. There was not a machine on site that was current on annual service. The

care, in order to safeguard the well-being of the animals.

2.35(f)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
The report from the semi-annual program review and facility inspection from May 2015 was not available for review
at the time of inspection. The semiannual reports shall be updated at least once every 6 months upon completion of
the required semiannual evaluation and shall be maintained by the research facility and made available for
inspection upon request. Efforts to obtain the report via phone or email were not successful.
The copies of teaching protocols on site consist of forms that contain animal numbers that are filled in by hand, and
the form was signed by the Principle Investigator (PI) in May 2015, but there is no indication that the IACUC had
approved the specific animal numbers applicable to this location. The attached IACUC approval form had not been
filled out or signed. Official IACUC approved versions were not available for inspection, despite efforts via phone
and email.
Failure to provide access to records, such as protocols with IACUC approval documentation, and semi-annual
review reports, impedes the assessment of animal activities and compliance with animal welfare regulations. Semi-annual reports should be made available for inspection at all sites from this time forward.
An exit interview was completed with the facility representative on site.
This inspection was completed by Veterinary Medical Officers Dr. Pamela L. Smith and Dr. Katharine C. Frank.
