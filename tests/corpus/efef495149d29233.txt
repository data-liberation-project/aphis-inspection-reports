2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee stated July 8, 2021 that he was employing a new attending veterinarian and was having him complete a
program of veterinary care. Upon review of the PVC on hand there was only a reference guide in place that had not been
approved for use by the AV. Also the written PVC for the new AV had not been completed by the time of the inspection.
The attending veterinarian needs to have a formal arrangement in place to illustrate that adequate veterinary care will be
provided to the animals at the facility. The AV shall have a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled
visits to the facility for their health and well-being. Correct by December 14, 2021.
2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was a male coatimundi that was being used for breeding and was injured by the female. The licensee stated that it
was normal to see some level of roughness displayed during the breeding process but the injury observed was more than
minor cuts. Per the attending veterinarian, the male coatimundi, which previously had his penile sheath repaired, was not
a good candidate for breeding. The AV was unaware that the licensee was intending to use the male for breeding
purposes. Although the licensee discussed separating the animal and taking him off of the breeding program as a
corrective measure, there wasn't a clear line of communication about the health and use of the animals with the attending


veterinarian. The communication between licensee and AV must be direct and frequent to ensure the proper use of the
animals so that they are being utilized in the safest and most appropriate manner. The licensee shall exercise a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of health, behavior,
and well-being of the animals is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct from this day forward.

wound was about and inch long in front of the left eye extending behind the left to the cheek area. It was red and wet in
appearance with debris attached to it. the wound on the left paw was also wet in appearance on top of the 3rd digit. Per
the licensee, he was housed in the female's cage for breeding purposes and the female attacked him. Housing


incompatible animals together can negatively affect animal and welfare. Animals shall not be housed near animals that
cause them discomfort and should be separated for their well-being.
