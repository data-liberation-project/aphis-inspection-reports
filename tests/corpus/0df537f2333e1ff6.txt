2.8
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
An inspection of the licensee's facility was attempted on July 19. The house appeared to be vacant. I could see
through the glass in the front door that there was no furniture in the house. I left a phone message and emailed the
licensee. She replied to my email that she is not currently residing at this address and provided me with her current
mailing address. It is necessary that licensees inform Animal Care of a change in address so that inspections can
be performed and so that mailings can be received. The licensee must notify the AC Regional Director within 10
days of a change in address.
To be corrected by August 04, 2018.

I knocked on the front door without an answer. The house appeared to be vacant. I could see through the glass in
the front door that there was no furniture in the house. I called the licensee's phone number and left a message.
