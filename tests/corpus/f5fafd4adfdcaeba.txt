2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Yorkshire terrier (tag #144) has an abnormal appearance to the hair coat. A large section of the upper left
hindquarter is hairless and there is a large section of thinning hair on the upper right hindquarter. The hair on the
left and right side of the tail is also thinning. A licensed veterinarian has not been consulted on the condition of this
dog's hair coat. An abnormal hair coat could indicate an underlying health issue.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective
treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor section of the dog enclosures are constructed of plastic dividers and wire flooring. In at least three
enclosures, containing a total of six dogs, the plastic dividers are no longer attached/contacting the wire flooring
resulting in large gaps. The gaps are large enough that a dog's foot and leg could pass through and enter the
neighboring enclosure. Large gaps between the enclosure dividers and the flooring could cause injury to the dogs.
Housing facilities for dogs must be constructed and designed so that they protect the dogs from injury and contain
the animals securely. The licensee must alter these enclosures in a manner that removes the gaps between the
dividers and the flooring and eliminates the risk of injury. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are kept in
good repair and are safe for the dogs at all times.
