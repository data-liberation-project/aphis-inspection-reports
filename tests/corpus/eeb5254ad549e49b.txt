FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In Barn 3 there were large rabbit feeders where the lip of the feeder that contains the feed was worn to a jagged
rusty edge. In some cases, the rabbit was even stepping on the jagged edge to investigate their environment. The
housing facilities, including the feeders within the primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury. There is a potential for injury to the face or feet of the rabbits from
the ragged and rusty edge of the feeder, and these feeders must be repaired or replaced.

3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
In at least two enclosures in Barns 1 and 3, there was an excessive accumulation of hair and feces on the floor or
side of the rabbit enclosures. Primary enclosures shall be kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs, and other
debris by periodic cleaning. The cleaning schedule for this enclosure is inadequate, as evidenced by the build up
present. The cleaning schedule of this rabbit enclosure should be more effective to prevent the build up of excreta.
