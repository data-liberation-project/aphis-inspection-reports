FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Three adult rabbits are living in a wire mesh sided hutch with a roof placed next to a barn. Three sides are open to
the rain and wind. If windy, the rain can blow into the enclosure making it difficult for the rabbits to stay dry and to
retain body heat. In addition, temperatures at night are starting to get near and below freezing at this time of year.
There is currently no shelter structure within the enclosure for the rabbits to seek shelter from the elements. The
rabbits housed outdoors shall be provided with access to shelter.
3.53(a)(3) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The rabbit water and food containers in the bunny village are exposed to the weather elements. There is currently
nothing constructed as part of this outdoor enclosure to protect the feed receptacles from the elements (such as
sun, rain etc). Deteriorated feed and contaminated water may not be palatable to the rabbits and may lose
nutritional value. The enclosure must be constructed and maintained to ensure the rabbits have convenient access
to clean food and water.
3.55 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water in the water receptacle for the five rabbits in the bunny village was completely green and opaque today.
The bottom of the receptacle could not be visualized. Dead bugs and debris were floating on the surface. Drinking
contaminated water can lead to disease and illness. Poor water quality/taste may cause animals to stop drinking
leading to dehydration. All water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized (detergent followed by disinfectant or
detergent/disinfectant combo) when dirty and at least once every 2 weeks to ensure that the rabbits have potable
water at all times.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative. This is a focused inspection of the rabbits.
