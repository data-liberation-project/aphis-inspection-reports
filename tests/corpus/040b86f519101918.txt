ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
* According to daily observation records, there were 16 days during a two month period (3 February 2015 through 7
April 2015) when no one checked on the breeder hamsters. Ten of those 16 days (62.5%) occurred on a Saturday
or Sunday. During that same two month time period, daily observation records indicated there were 23 days that no
one checked on the hamsters on study. Nearly half (48%) of the daily observations missed in that room occurred
on a Saturday or Sunday. During Spring Break (20-29 March 2015) the hamsters on study were only observed
twice according to records. Daily observation of animals is necessary to ensure any illnesses or injuries that occur
can be treated in a timely manner.
** The registrant must ensure that all animals are observed daily (including weekends, holidays, and school breaks)
to ensure their health and well-being. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 8 April 2015.
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with a facility representative. The correction date of 8
April 2015 was stated during the exit interview and acknowledged by the facility representative.
