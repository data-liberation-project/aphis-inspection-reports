FEEDING.
Through-out the kennel building there are eight primary enclosures whose contained animals are not provided with
food receptacles. The dealer stated the animals had been chewing the food receptacles so he removed them
placing the dry food on the floor of the enclosure. Food receptacles must be provided for all dogs. They must be
readily accessible to all dogs and must be located so as to minimize contamination by excreta and pests, and be
protected from rain and snow. Feeding pans must either be made of a durable material that can be easily cleaned
and sanitized or be disposable.
Affects twelve adults. Corrects by August 7, 20153.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The kennel building needs to be cleaned through-out the common areas of the kennel building, the food storage
area and the puppy housing area. There are accumulations of dead bugs, hair, dirt, spilt food, medical containers
with used syringes and open food containers for non-regulated animals. Premises where housing facilities are
located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals
from injury, to facilitate husbandry practices and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and
other pests and vermin.
Affects twenty-eight adults and fifteen puppies. Correct by August 8, 2015
