FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
The stretch of fence separating the bison and whitetail deer enclosures had multiple areas along the fence where
the wire has broken leaving sharp points protruding outward into the whitetail deer enclosure. There is a corner of
the small wire mesh on the stretch of fence separating the whitetail deer and peacock enclosures on the whitetail
deer side that has detached leaving sharp points exposed. There is a heavy gauge metal chain wrapped around a
tree in the whitetail deer enclosure that presents a risk of entanglement. A wooden feeder in the shelter for the
whitetail deer has nails exposed on one end. Fencing material is used to keep the bison from damaging the trees
inside the enclosure. At least one of the trees has broken wires on the fencing leaving sharp points protruding
outward and some of the fencing material used consists of barbed wire also with sharp points. Sharp points, nails or
other risks such as chains present physical hazards that could cause injury to the animals. The licensee already had
plans to replace the stretch of fence between the whitetail deer and bison enclosures and has the supplies on hand;
however, sharp points must be addressed in the meantime to minimize injury risks to the animals. Remove, repair
or replace the above mentioned areas to prevent injury. Correct by July 30, 2014.

SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
The indoor food storage area has an excessive amount of spilled feed on the ground. There is an effective pest
control plan in place; however, there is evidence that pests have access to the food storage area. The food storage
area should be kept clean and free of excessive accumulations of spilled feed so as not to attract pests, which could
contaminate the feed or expose the animals to diseases. Trash or waste should be placed in designated areas and
cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. Correct by July 11, 2014.
