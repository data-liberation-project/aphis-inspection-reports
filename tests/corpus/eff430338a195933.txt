Personnel qualifications.
Two incidents were associated with experimentally induced diabetic pigs on a wound study. During rounds on August 6,
2021, the attending veterinarian noticed a laboratory technician having difficulty getting the large pig on the scale for a
body weight. The attending veterinarian assisted the laboratory member getting the pig on the scale and set up training
with the clinical veterinarian. On September 9th, 2021, the veterinary staff were reviewing the blood glucose records
completed by the same laboratory technician. While reviewing the study records, the veterinary staff noticed the blood
glucose levels were lower than expected. After the laboratory technician had difficulty weighing the large pigs and the
blood glucose level inconsistencies were noted, the veterinary staff took over obtaining body weights and blood glucose
readings of all the pigs.

Training and instruction of personnel must include guidance in proper handling and care for the various species of
animals used by the facility. Research facilities must ensure that all personnel are trained on procedures listed in a
protocol for the health and well-being of the animals.



This was corrected at the time of inspection by the clinical veterinarian retraining all the laboratory technicians on the
handling of pigs and the use of the glucometer.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
