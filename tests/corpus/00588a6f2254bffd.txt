3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and
cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
The lot for the goats and sheep has numerous pieces of discarded blue and red twine from round bales of hay.
Twine should be removed to prevent possible accidental ingestion by the regulted animals, prevent injury to the
regulated animals, and facilitate good husbandry practices.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
