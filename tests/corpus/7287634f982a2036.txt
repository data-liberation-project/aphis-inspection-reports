3.28(a)(1) Critical

Primary enclosures.
A total of 6 hamsters of 132 on Protocol A escaped from the primary enclosures. The hamsters are housed in disposable
caging.

On May 5, 2022, 3 male hamsters (#5102, #5103, and #5104) on chewed a medium sized hole of a back corner of their
cage and escaped within the room they were housed. Hamster #5104 sustained multiple injuries and was euthanized as
recommended by the veterinarian and in accordance with protocol requirements. The other hamsters were only
euthanized to fulfill protocol requirements for tissue collection.
On May 8, 2022, it was discovered that 3 female hamsters (#5063, #5064, and #5065) chewed a hole in their cage and
escaped. Two hamsters were found in areas outside of the room in which they are housed. One hamster was found inside
the animal room. All animals were in good health.

The caging is not of sufficient strength to withstand the natural behavior of hamsters to chew. Hamsters must be housed
in primary enclosures made of material that will remain structurally sound. Enhanced husbandry practices must be


implemented to ensure the structural integrity of the primary enclosures or alternative caging should be provided to
prevent escape and injury. Correct by August 13, 2022. NOTE: An order for non-disposable cages has been placed.
3.75(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
There are areas of drywall damage in Rooms 214 and 329 due to the removal of particle board and the rigors of daily
hosing of the surfaces. The damage renders a rough surface that exposes under layers of the drywall. The damaged
surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces in non-human primate housing areas must be maintained on a
regular basis to facilitate all established husbandry practices. The damages surfaces must be replaced or repaired to
ensure proper cleaning and sanitization of the walls. Correct by July 10, 2022.
3.84(d) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
An excessive number of bugs were seen inside the cover of light fixtures in Rooms 325, 326, and 210. Three small
roaches were seen on the wall in the anteroom for Room 311. A pest control program must be effective in preventing the
attraction of pests. Effective measures must be implemented to minimize the attraction of pests to the animal rooms.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and the Institutional Official.
