Indoor housing facilities.
At the time of the inspection, the ambient temperature outside was 90 deg F. The indoor holding areas for two Spider
monkeys was very hot and humid and 95.7 deg F according to the handheld Kestral 3000. The area had no discernable
air movement and there was a damp, musty odor in the building. There was no auxiliary ventilation such as fans, blowers,
or air conditioning available to maintain humidity and temperature at a comfortable level.

The indoor holding area for the two Gibbon’s was also very hot and humid with an ambient temperature of 93.3 deg F
according to the handheld Kestral 3000. This holding area also did not have fans, blowers, or air conditioning available to
maintain temperature and humidity at a comfortable level.

Indoor housing for non-human primates must have auxiliary means to cool and regulate temperature and humidity when
temperatures go above 85 deg F. A manner of ventilating these spaces must be implemented for the health and comfort
of the animals.

Facilities, general.

The metal frames that frame the doors for sea lion holding have paint that is flaking off, revealing rusted areas underneath
the missing paint. Flaking paint can become a contaminant to the holding area or the sea lions if they begin to pick at the
paint. Additionally, rusted areas can no longer be cleaned and effectively disinfected. These door frames must be
maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals and to facilitate husbandry practices.

Water quality.
The water quality records for the sea lion pool show a coliform count of 2420 MPN weekly from 7/20/20-8/3/20 and again
from 8/24/20 to 9/9/20. These samples were taken on a Monday and the pool was dropped the following day to provide
new water for the animals. However, no subsequent samples were then taken after a water change to determine if the
coliform counts had come down to acceptable levels. When the sample was taken again the following Monday, the count
was again 2420 MPN and this cycle continued for 4-6 weeks.

The facility needs to reevaluate when samples are collected and tested or additional tests should be done to assure water
quality is maintained within specific parameters for the animal’s overall comfort, health and well-being.

Facilities, general.
The indoor holding area for two red panda has paint that is flaking and peeling from multiple sections of the ceiling, walls,
and floor. Paint chips could become a contaminant to the animals and this area should be maintained on a regular basis
to prevent this. Additionally, the metal tube that is used as a shift walkway to the exhibit is showing considerable signs of

rust throughout the tube and the bottom of this tube underneath the wood beam is beginning to deteriorate. Indoor holding
area for the red pandas need to be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

The metal hollow door to hyena holding has a large section of rusted metal at the based of the door on the keeper side.
The area is so deteriorated with rust, that the inspector was able to touch it with her foot and push into the hollow section
of the door. Although there is a metal plate on the other side of the door, this section of the door needs to be reinforced or
replaced to keep the door structurally sound and in good repair.

Sanitation.
There is a wood beam that runs down the length of a metal tube which acts as a shift area for red pandas. There is an
accumulation of feces and food debris trapped underneath the wood beam and curved base of the tube. This tube needs
to be cleaned and debris removed on a routine basis to reduce odors and minimize contamination to animals as they
move through tunnel daily.
