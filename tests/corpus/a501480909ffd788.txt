Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:20am on 04-
November-22.

Upon arrival, I knocked on the door and called the phone number listed. The licensee answered stating she was out of the
area and could not return in time for the inspection process. Hours of availability were discussed.
