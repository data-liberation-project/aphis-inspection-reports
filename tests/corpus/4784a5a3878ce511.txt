Facilities, general.
Several areas of the facility are in disrepair and pose a risk to the animals:
--Primary enclosure fencing in two different pastures is in disrepair. Four sections of chain-link fencing, two in the South
Paddock and two in the North Pasture, are missing metal connectors between the fencing and the top bar. The panels in
the North Pasture are only attached at the top to vertical poles every 8-10 feet. The panels in the South Paddock have no
additional vertical support because the vertical posts are disconnected from the top bar and the chain link. When pressure
is applied to the top fence line, a gap of about 12” is formed between the chain link and the top rail. In the South Paddock,
this creates a 30 foot long gap. Some of the panels were missing several bottom clips as well, creating a gap of about 6”
between the chain link and the bottom rail. These enclosures are used to house small ruminants such as sheep, goats,
and alpacas, along with cattle. Large gaps between fencing and support poles can entrap animals who attempt to push
through, injure them, or let them escape their primary enclosure. All facilities must be kept in good repair to protect and
contain the animals.
-- There are large areas of flaking paint along the South Paddock side of the barn. Green paint is actively flaking off and
peeling away from the wooden doors and walls of the barn. This area is in direct contact with goats, sheep, and Alpacas.
Ingesting paint can lead to potential illness or injury.


-- There is a large, rolled up piece of chain-link fencing laying on the ground along the far fence line in the Mid Pasture.
The chain link has several sharp points along the edges which could injure animals and creates a tripping or
entanglement hazard.
Correct by November 2, 2022 by ensuring all facilities are maintained in good repair and protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals.
