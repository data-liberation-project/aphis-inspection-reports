2.40(a)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian reports that the exhibitor has failed to follow through with prescribed treatment for chronic
respiratory disease in the rabbits. She has failed to pick up a new prescribed medicine, and at the time of inspection
she stated that she was using a medication which was found to be expired. Whereas the veterinarian has
recommended humane euthanasia for rabbits that do not respond to treatment, the exhibitor stated that she has
been keeping or selling them. The attending veterinarian had requested a copy of the written Program of Veterinary
Care so as to make changes discussed during a consultation in July, but the exhibitor has been unresponsive, and
it is unclear whether she is currently employing an attending veterinarian.
The exhibitor should work with an attending veterinarian to ensure that all the animals receive appropriate care. The
exhibitor must ensure that the veterinarian has the appropriate authority to make decisions regarding adequate care
for the animals. Failure to communicate, employ, and collaborate with the attending veterinarian, and follow the
written Program of Veterinary Care, could be detrimental to the well-being of the animals.
The exhibitor should take immediate steps to employ the help of an attending veterinarian, and collaborate with that
person so as to provide a consistent program of veterinary care for the animals.
3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At the time of inspection it was found that about a third of the rabbit cages had bent doors that created a gap, where
rabbits could either become entangled and be injured, or escape. One rabbit was running loose, outside of its
enclosure, at the time of arrival during the inspection.
Primary enclosures should be structurally sound and maintained in good repair in order to protect the rabbits from
injury, to contain them.
The exhibitor should make repairs and ensure that there are no gaps that could allow a rabbit to be injured orescape. To be corrected immediately.
3.55
WATERING.
At the time of inspection it was discovered that two of the (cid:28)lixit(cid:29) type automatic waterers were not functioning. A
rabbit singly housed in one of the affected enclosures was moved to an enclosure with a functional water source,
and displayed extreme thirst, drinking rapidly for nearly a minute.
Care should be taken to ensure that the rabbits have adequate water supplied to them to meet their hydration
needs, and avoid stress. The exhibitor should inspect waterers on a regular basis to ensure that they are functioning
correctly, and examine rabbits at least daily to verify that they appear healthy and well-hydrated.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the exhibitor.
