2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**Although the licensee utilizes two attending veterinarians for the care of the animals, only one attending
veterinarian is listed on the written program of veterinary care. The attending veterinarian responsible for the care
of the animals should be listed on the program of veterinary care. It is necessary for the licensee to have a formal
written agreement with the attending veterinarian who is providing care for the animals in order to ensure proper
veterinary oversight.
