ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- A female guinea pig in an enclosure on the far wall of the pet store was immobile and the back legs were splayed
out awkwardly behind her. She was unable to walk properly. It appeared as though her back was injured because
she was unable to move her back legs. The caretakers had given the guinea pig a treat an hour before the
inspection started and stated that the guinea pig was moving fine at that time. Upon discovery, the guinea pig was
taken to the veterinarian immediately. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and
appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to
the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
This was corrected during the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Brittany Light, ACI and a facility representative.
