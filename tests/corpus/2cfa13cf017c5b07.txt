2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Multiple expired medications were found stored in the main medication storage area. The expired medications
included a bottle of lactulose, three bottles of Gabapentin, and two bottles of Droncit. The use of expired
medications is not considered to be appropriate veterinary care. Expired medications can have unpredictable
effectiveness, and could potentially result in problems due to unexpected side effects. There must be an effective
system in place to identify and remove expired medications.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
