Facilities, general.
In the large sheep and goat pasture, there were several areas in a state of disrepair. The right wall of the run-in shelter
has detached from the support posts causing an approximately 18" gap at the base of the building and exposing several
sharp nails at the level of the animals. In the same enclosure, one of the fence lines, adjacent to a horse pasture, was
broken and lying on the ground. There were also several pieces of plastic and other trash scattered throughout the
pasture.
Failure to maintain enclosure fencing and shelters can allow for gaps, unstable structures, or sharp points which can
result in injury, entrapment, or escape of the animals.
Facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.
3.130 Repeat

Watering.
There was a buildup of algae and debris on the inside of the main automatic waterer in the the large sheep and goat
pasture. The water is clear and the health of the animals does not appear to be impacted by the condition of the waterer
at this point.
Failure to clean water receptacles on a regular basis can deter the sheep and goats from drinking and can introduce


disease hazards to the animals.
The licensee must clean the waterer at a frequency that will ensure potable water is provided to the regulated animals in a
sanitary receptacle.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
