3.1(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
The doggie doors in 2 buildings housing adult dogs and puppies have excessive rust. Surfaces that are rusted cannot be
cleaned and sanitized properly. Interior surfaces and any surfaces that come in contact with dogs must be free of
excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.
3.9(b)

Feeding
Several stainless-steel food bowls inside primary enclosures of adult dogs and puppies are completely covered with rust.
Rust prevents proper cleaning and sanitization of the food bowls. Feeding pans must either be made of a durable
material that can be easily cleaned and sanitized or be disposable.
