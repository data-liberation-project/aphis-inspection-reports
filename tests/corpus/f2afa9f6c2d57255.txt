Unkempt hair coats and long toenails can cause discomfort to the animals. Long facial hair and facial mats can
affect the dogs eye sight and may lead to eye conditions. Heavy, tight matting may cause a tugging sensation which
often results in irritation, scratching and other skin disorders. The licensee shall provide adequate vetrinary care
which includes rotuine grooming. A proactive approach should be used for both hair coat maintenance and toe nail
trimming so that animals do not develop mats or have excessively long nails. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 6/21/2014

FEEDING.
(b) The red plastic self-feeders used throughout the facility had white mold growing on the inside surfaces of the
feeders. Additionally, at least 2 of the feeders had pieces of molded feed in the feeder. The feeders do not have lids
and the licensee is filling the feeders with enough feed for multiple days. Molded dog food and unclean feeders
have the potential to sicken dogs. The licensee shall ensure all of the food receptacles are adequately and routinely
cleaned and sanitized and that a lid or cover is used on top of the feeder to protect the feed from moisture and dirt.
