Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC is required to review, at least once every six months, the research facility’s program for humane care and use
of animals. The last IACUC meeting occurred in March 2022. As of the date of this inspection, no additional meeting has
occurred or been scheduled.
The facility needs to ensure the IACUC meets and reviews significant changes to program activities at least once within
every six-month period.

2.31(c)(6)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Significant changes to activities related to the care and use of animals requires approval or denial by the IACUC prior to
those activities occurring. The facility’s attending veterinarian, who was listed on approved protocols as one of the
investigators, resigned. Her last day was Oct 6, 2022. Protocols have not been amended to reflect the changes to the
investigators, therefore those changes have not been reviewed or approved by the IACUC, however animal activities
continue to occur.
Changes to the attending veterinarian at a veterinary technology program should be considered a significant change and


all animal activity with the previous attending veterinarian as an investigator should cease until protocol amendments are
made and approved by the IACUC.
