SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
There was an excessive amount of loose bedding and hay on the floors in the walkways and around the feed
storage. Large amounts of loose bedding can make areas for pests (rodents or insects) to live in which could cause
animals to get sick. Ensure that the areas outside of the enclosures are kept clean to protect the health and
wellbeing of the animals.
