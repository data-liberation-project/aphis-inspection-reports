FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The lower rear corner of the metal degu enclosure has rusted. One area of the rusted metal has broken and is
protruding into the enclosure. Broken metal in an enclosure can lead to structural instability and can possibly cause
injury to the animals. The facility must ensure that all housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by 15 June
2016.
