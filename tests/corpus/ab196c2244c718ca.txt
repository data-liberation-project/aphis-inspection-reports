2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection, the inspectors identified two animals that were in need of acute veterinary care:
1) On 3-3-16 several people were noted congregated in front of a stall housing goats. Two of the people were
overheard voicing concern and were upset over a couple of newborn goat kids in the enclosure that appeared weak
and unable to rise on their own and thus could not nurse. One very small brown goat kid was noted making high
pitched crying noises. Every few minutes it would try to lift its head or one of its legs but could not do so for more
than a couple of seconds. It was unable to rise on its own. A second white with brown on face goat kid was also
noticed to be weak and lying in a position with its legs unnaturally splayed. Both kids appeared thin with a
pronounced bone structure especially compared to the other set of newborn goat kids in the same enclosure. An
auction staff member was notified and tried to assist the kids with nursing by holding them up to the mother goat.
The staff member stated that the vet tech staff knew about the birth that morning but had not been informed about
their current weakness. The attending veterinarian was consulted by the inspectors and had not been notified about
the goat kids. The goat kids were no longer present at the auction on 3-4-16.
2) During a walk through the auction barn on 3-4-16 an addax (#7628) was noted missing its left horn. There was
freshly clotted blood on its head and running down the left side of its face from the wound where the horn had been.
Review of the consignment form indicated "broken horn". A conversation with auction staff indicated they consigned
the addax with a horn that broke off during transport to the auction. The attending veterinarian was unaware of the
addax.
3) On the morning of 3-5-16 one capybara (#176) was noted with a fresh moist bright red lesion on the top of its
nose about 1/2 in x 1 inch in size. No veterinary attention had been sought.
Lack of adequate veterinary care for acute conditions can lead to distress and suffering of the animals. The facility is
responsible for identifying veterinary issues, communicating with the veterinarian about the issues and ensuring
adequate veterinary care to include diagnosis and treatment for those animals needing emergency care while at the
auction.
2.131(b)(1) REPEATHANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On the morning of 3-3-16 the inspectors watched the auction staff moving goats and sheep from their enclosures to
the auction ring. One young adult man with reddish hair was noted kicking and using a whip on the animals that he
considered moving along too slowly. When a second auction staff member noted us observing them, the young
adult man was taken aside and the whip was exchanged for a plastic guide pole. Later that same day, several
young boys helping out with the movement of the sheep and goats were noted physically pushing, shoving and
pulling goats and sheep rather than allowing them to move along at their preferred speed. During this entire time the
boys were loudly yelling at the animals. Again when the older more experienced staff noted the presence of the
inspectors, they told the younger boys to end the aggressive behavior.
Kicking, whipping and shoving of animals results in behavioral stress, discomfort and possible injury to the animals.
All animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.
2.131(e)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures in the back behind the covered barn pens/stalls are open to the elements with
no sides or overhead protection from inclement weather. The weather on 3/3/16 started out grey, overcast and
snowy. After a couple of hours, the snow changed over to rain that continued through the afternoon. One young
watusi was noted to be wet and shivering and exhibited a tucked-up body, indicating discomfort. The calf was
watched for 10 minutes and was noted to be full-body shivering throughout the observation period. The temperature
at that time was recorded at 40.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Cold weather coupled with snow and rain makes it difficult for
animals, especially young animals, to maintain their core body temperature. Inability to maintain appropriate body
temperatures can predispose animals, especially young animals, to increased risk of disease due to stress,
discomfort and hypothermia. The calf was rechecked on 3-4-16 and appeared to be more comfortable and dry and
was no longer shivering. When climatic conditions present a threat to the animals health or well-being, appropriate
measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of these conditions. Correct from this day forward.
3.38(a)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
On 3-5-16 the inspectors noticed several hamsters curled up inside the water receptacle in an enclosure housing 17
young hamsters. The auction staff emptied the receptacle of the hamsters-it was dry. Water was added to the water
receptacle and seven hamsters immediately started trying to drink simultaneously with several trying to push their
way to the water. The hamsters' drinking continued for at least 10 minutes. A small amount of dry pelleted food
was present in the food receptacle. Access to potable water is necessary for the health and well-being of all
animals. Hamsters shall have access to food and water or a type of food which provides the requirements for foodand water sufficient to satisfy their food and water needs. Corrected during the inspection.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures in the back behind the covered barn pens/stalls are open to the elements with
no sides or overhead protection from inclement weather. The weather on 3/3/16 started out grey, overcast and
snowy. After a couple of hours the snow changed over to rain. The animals outside (including water buffalo, watusi,
bison, cattle) had no protection or shelter to allow them to remain dry during the snow and rain. The dirt in their
enclosures quickly became wet sloppy mud and standing water. The animals' haircoats became wet. One young
watusi was noted shivering during the afternoon. Wet haircoats make it difficult for animals, especially young
animals, to maintain their core body temperature. The following morning on 3/4/16 the standing water and mud in
the enclosures was over ankle deep on the animals. A second watusi calf was noted trying to stand in a corner with
a tiny patch of green growth and drier ground to avoid the mud. The animals' feet made sucking sounds when they
lifted them to move about in their enclosure. This may lead to slipping of the animals, hoof problems and injury. Live
animals shall be provided protection to allow them to remain dry during inclement weather such as snow and rain.
3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Two pens in newer smaller barn next door to the large arena barn were noted containing so many sheep and goats
that the animals could not turn around freely or lie down without being trampled by other animals on 3-3-16. The
animals were of multiple sizes and some of the smaller animals were noted standing underneath the larger/taller
ones as they had nowhere else to go. The pens measured approximately 6ft x 9.75 ft. One contained 28 animals.
The second contained 20 animals.
Two pens in the large arena barn were noted containing so many llamas and alpacas that the animals could not turn
around freely or lie down without risk of getting trampled on 3-3-16. The pens measured 5ft x5ft and 5ft x 6ft and
each contained five llamas/alpacas .
Overcrowding can lead to stress, discomfort, injury and overheating. Enclosures/pens used to house animals shall
be large enough to ensure that each animal contained therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make
normal postural adjustments (stand, sit and lie down).
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION. Varying lengths of twine were noted on the ground and tied to enclosures and within easy reach of the animals
throughout the facility. One goat and one watusi cross, housed in different areas of the facility, were noted chewing
and eating the twine. Twine ingestion can lead to intestinal tract issues. The facility premises and grounds shall be
kept clean in order to protect the animals and facilitate prescribed husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall
be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary.
3.137(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
An adult African Crested Porcupine was housed in a wood and wire enclosure that had a damaged door and two
palm-sized openings close to and above the door. The damage to the door and the holes in the wire mesh
appeared to have been created by chewing and pulling by the animal inside the enclosure, as the door leaned
precariously into the cage. The whole door-side of the enclosure was unstable. Unsecure doors and open holes
can lead to injury to the animal and enable its escape. A temporary stabilization to the door was attempted but did
not correct the structural deficiencies noted above. Primary transport enclosures must be constructed in such a
manner that the structural strength of the enclosure is sufficient to contain the live animal and withstand the normal
rigors of transportation. Correct from this day forward.
Inspection conducted during the auction on 3-3-16 through 3-5-16.
