the semi-annual inspections of the facilities and reviews of the programs and, reporting the semi- annual findings to the
Institutional Officer. The committee was unaware of the duties that they were required to conduct for the research facility.
The IACUC appointed to assess the research facility's animal program, facilities and, procedures did not have any
knowledge of the duties prescribe to them by the regulations. The Chief Executive Officer of the research facility shall

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The facility's record still shows that the Palatability protocol has PP, an individual who is no longer associated with the
facility, listed as Program Manager/Principal Investigator. Another individual, JP, has been designated as the facility’s
Program Manager and this information has not been corrected. The PI has yet to submit a modification to be reviewed
and IACUC did not review and approve this change since the October 2020 inspection. A change in the Principal
Investigator of a protocol is considered a significant change to a protocol. The IACUC must conduct a review of all


significant changes to a protocol in order to determine that the proposed animal activities and personnel changes are in
accordance with the Animal Welfare Act Regulations. The IACUC must review and approve, require modifications in (to
secure approval) or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in all
ongoing protocols.

Welfare Act. Correct from this day forward.

shall be held accountable for all official tags. In the event an official tag is lost from a dog while in the possession of a
research facility, the facility shall make a diligent effort to locate and reapply the tag to the proper animal. If the lost tag is

Housing facilities, general.
The fencing near the walkway of the most eastern exercise pen is rolling up away from the ground, raised and lifted up
enough for a large dog to get under it. This may allow an animal to escape or get caught under the fencing which could
potentially harm the animal.

There were also deep holes under majority of the platforms in the yards, one of which was about 2 feet wide and 3 feet
deep. These holes are under the platforms that are utilized by the dogs during play that needed to be filled to prevent
injury.

The facilities must be maintained and kept in good repair to keep out unwanted animals, prevent escape or injury.

sanitized before dog use. Correct by May 31, 2021
