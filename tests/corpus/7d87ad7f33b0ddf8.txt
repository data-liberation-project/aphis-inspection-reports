INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The report to the Institutional Official (IO) dated October 29, 2014 for the semi-annual inspection which had taken
place in September 2014 did not distinguish in the facility inspection findings between significant and minor
deficiencies. The IACUC is responsible for ensuring that the semi-annual reports submitted to the IO are first
reviewed and signed by a majority of the members, include any minority views, identify any departures from the
Animal Welfare Act and state the reasons, distinguish significant from minor deficiencies, and contain a plan and
schedule with dates of correction for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct this item from this point forward.
