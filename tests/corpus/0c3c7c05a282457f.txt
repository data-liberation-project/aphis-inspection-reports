2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult, tan, female dachshund ("Phyllis" Microchip # 076112937) has a severe build-up of a thick, yellow/tan
material encasing all of the upper and lower cheek teeth and approximately half of the surface of each canine. The
majority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive build-up of the yellow/tan
material. There is a yellow/tan/milky substance running along the top of all of the upper cheek teeth near the gum
line. The gums are severely red and swollen and in some areas they are pulled back from the teeth. All of the dogs(cid:25)
nails were excessively long and starting to curl. One nail on the back, right foot was severely long and curled back
onto the side of the foot pad.
One adult, female, grey and white poodle (Tag # 183) is limping and carrying her left, front foot. There is a small,
soft, approximately 1-2 cm in diameter, red/dark pink swelling on the top of the same foot. Cloudy, red fluid was
expressed when the licensee squeezed the swelling. The animal (cid:28)yipped(cid:29) slightly when the licensee touched the
swelling. The licensee stated that the dog occasionally limps but he had not noticed the swelling which he called an
abscess. Immediately, the licensee obtained 4/10 of a cc of penicillin and placed it within the opening of the
swelling. There is no documentation that this animal has been seen by a veterinarian for this issue or that the
licensee has consulted with the veterinarian about treating swellings, such as abscesses, with penicillin in this
manner.
Conditions such as these can be painful and can lead to further health complications. Both animals listed above
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an
appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and
resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.
One, adult, black shih tzu ("Ziggy" Microchip # 0A02130637) and one, adult, grey and white, cocker spaniel/poodle
cross (no ID) have severely matted hair-coats. On both of the dogs, the majority of the mats are on the back half of
the body, but there are mats on the chest and sides of the body as well. The hair all over the body and face of both
dogs was very long and clumped together. The hair around the face of the shih tzu was wet and hung down in front
of the eyes. The inspectors were unable to do a hands-on physical exam for these two dogs due to their aggressive nature. The
licensee confirms these dogs are matted.
Matting can be painful and can lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. All dogs need to have their hair
coats routinely maintained in order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases associated with excessive
matting.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Hunte" building there is one enclosure, containing one adult Boston Terrier, that has a metal cage front.
There is a large opening in the cage front that is supposed to contain a self-feeder. There was no self-feeder
occupying this opening and the dog was observed to putting his entire head through the opening. The dog could
become trapped or injure himself while putting his head through the opening.
All housing facilities for dogs must be constructed so that they protect the animal from injury and contain the animal
securely. The opening in this door must be altered in a manner that does not allow the dog to put his head through.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs and contain them securely.
Correction date: September 30, 2015
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Hunte" building the enclosures have metal cage fronts and at least twelve of these cage fronts have become
excessively rusty and the rust is pitted and flaking. There are at least twenty dogs housed in these enclosures.
In the "Tool Shed" building there is one enclosure, containing three dogs, whose outdoor area has a metal wall
along the side of it. The metal along the ground has become excessively rusty and has broken leaving a hole in the
surface.
Also in the "Tool Shed" building the outdoor section of two enclosures is constructed of metal fence panels and
metal wire. These fence panels have become excessively rusty and the rust is pitted and flaking. There are six
dogs housed in these enclosures. Excessive rust prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of the surface and
could affect the structural strength.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be free of excessive rust. These rusty surfaces must be repaired, replaced oraltered in a manner that keeps them free of excessive rust so that cleaning and sanitization can occur and structural
issues are minimized. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain free of excessive rust at all times.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Big Dog Runs" the six enclosures are divided by metal fence panels and there are wood boards running
along the bottom of the fencing. The wood boards have been chewed, scratched and worn by the dogs. There are
seventeen dogs housed in these enclosures.
In the "Tool Shed" building there are three enclosures whose access doors are framed in wood. The wood has
been scratched and worn by the dogs. There are three adult dogs and at least twenty puppies housed in these
enclosures. Damaged and worn wood cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The damaged and worn wood must be replaced or altered in
a manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain in
good repair at all times.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are no wind/rain breaks on the thirteen shelters located in the "Dog Runs Along the Road". There are
twenty-seven dogs housed in these enclosures. The night before the inspection it had been raining and three of
these enclosures, containing eight dogs, had wet bedding in their shelters. Lack of wind/rain breaks on shelters
does not allow for the dogs to fully escape inclement weather and remain dry. The licensee must add wind/rain
breaks to the front of each shelter and ensure they remain in place at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "Big Building" there are two enclosures, containing four dogs, which have outdoor flooring constructed of wire.
In one enclosure the wire flooring has broken resulting in a small gap in the flooring and sharp points protruding
into the dog enclosure. In the other enclosure the flooring has broken resulting in a three inch long by one inch wide
hole in the floor. Also in the "Big Building" there is an indoor enclosure, containing two dogs, which has flooring
constructed of wire. This wire has broken resulting in a three inch long by one inch wide hole in the floor and sharp
points protruding into the enclosure. In another indoor enclosure, containing two dogs, the wire flooring has broken
and resulted in a sharp point protruding upward into the enclosure. The licensee removed this sharp point duringthe inspection.
Sharp points and holes in the floor could cause injury to the dogs'(cid:25) feet and legs. All primary enclosures must have
flooring constructed in a manner that protects the dogs(cid:25) feet and legs from injury and do not allow their feet to pass
through openings. The licensee must replace, repair, or alter the floors in a manner that keeps the dogs safe from
injury. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain safe for the dogs and in good repair.
Correction date: October 07, 2015
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the "Red Roof Building" there are three enclosures, containing seven dogs, whose access doors are framed in
plastic. There is a thick, dark buildup of dirt and grime on the frame of the access doors. In the "Big Building" the
outdoor section of two enclosures, containing four dogs, have a buildup of dirt and grime on their walls. The buildup
of dirt and grime could increase the risk of health hazards towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized once every two weeks, or more often if necessary, to
prevent the accumulation of dirt, grime and other disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of
dog enclosures remain free of accumulations of dirt and grime in order to reduce the risk of health hazards.
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Throughout the "Hunte" building and the "Dalmation" building there are an excessive number of flies. The flies were
observed to be on the walls of the buildings, the dog enclosures, the feeders and on food that had spilled on the
floor. There are fifty-nine dogs housed in the "Hunte" building and four dogs housed in the "Dalmation" building.
In the "Dalmation Building" there is a large amount of mouse feces along the floor in front of the entrance door. The
mouse feces were mixed with dog food and shredded paper that had dropped on the floor. There are two
enclosures, containing two dogs, in this section of the building.
In the "Big Building" there is a counter that holds the small medicine refrigerator. This counter is also used to
prepare dog food. There is a large amount of mouse feces located next to and behind the refrigerator. There are
fifty-six adult dogs and 18 puppies housed in this building. The presence of pests can cause food contamination
and lead to health hazards for the dogs. The licensee must ensure that a safe and effective program for the control of pests, including flies and mice, is
established and maintained.
