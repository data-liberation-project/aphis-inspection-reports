ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During an inspection on May 24, 2017, APHIS personnel observed numerous animals in need of veterinary
attention.
***In the petting zoo, a white and black adult female goat was reluctant to rise when prompted. When the goat
stood, APHIS personnel observed bilateral, “basketball sized,” swellings on either side of her body. When palpated,
the swellings appeared to be fluid filled.
***An adult female black and white ruffed lemur was observed to be thin, with a dull, patchy, and unkempt hair coat.
Veterinary records from May 2015 note a history of poor hair coat and thin body condition, however there was no
documentation of diagnosis, treatment, or veterinary follow up. Her most recent veterinary exam was August 2016.
***An adult male Brown tufted male capuchin, “Alfalfa,” had excessive hair loss along his back, the length of his tail,
and on the outside of his thighs. Veterinary records indicate that his last veterinary examination occurred on
October 17, 2016.
***An unidentified adult male Axis deer had excessively long hooves, with the toes curling upwards. When the deer
walked, he had an abnormal gait.
***An adult female Reeve’s muntjac with a green tag in her left ear had multiple patches of hair loss over her left hip
and left shoulder. Veterinary records indicate that her most recent veterinary examination occurred in 2008.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals
at the facility.
The animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plans for the problems cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to theinspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests, and the
outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing
instructions and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is
administered to the animal.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the facility must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary
care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing
adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries.
At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian examined the white and black adult female goat located in the
petting zoo.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection, the following animals were in need of veterinary attention:
- white and black adult female goat located at the petting zoo
- adult female black and white ruffed lemur
- adult male Brown tufted male capuchin, “Alfalfa”
- unidentified adult male Axis deer with excessively long hooves
- adult female Reeve’s muntjac with a green tag in her left ear
The facility failed to observe that these animals were in need of veterinary attention. The facility was unable to
provide any documentation that the veterinarian was notified about the condition of the animals. There was no
veterinary documentation indicating that the veterinarian had examined these animals.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and
the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily
observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.To be corrected by: June 1, 2017
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
It was observed that the public could make contact with several animals while they were in their primary enclosures.
***The log fence around the African crested porcupine enclosure is approximately three feet tall, allowing the public
to reach over the barrier and make contact with the animals.
***The log fence around the front of the Schmidt’s Spotnose guenon enclosure is very low, with several portions of
the fence being approximately 1.5 feet tall. The height of the fence allowed the public to make contact with the
animals while standing on the public side of the fence. Additionally, the height of the fence allows for members of
the public to step over it and approach the enclosure. APHIS personnel did not observe any facility employees in
the area.
***There is a section of the public barrier in front of the leopard enclosure that is inadequate. Members of the public
are able to reach out and touch the bars of the enclosure.
***A section of the wall of the primary enclosure containing muntjac deer consists entirely of chain link. There is no
public barrier at this section of the fence that prevents the public from having contact with the animals. APHIS
personnel observed several children touching the deer.
Failure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the viewing public may pose a risk of
harm to the animal and to the public. A sufficient barrier system must be in place to assure the safety of all animals
and the public.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***APHIS personnel observed two members of the public in the petting zoo, making contact with the goats and deer.
There were no facility employees present during this public/animal interaction. During a 15 minute time span, the
attendant entered the enclosure once and failed to observe the interaction between the animals and the public while
present.
Unsupervised contact between animals and members of the public poses a potential risk both to the health of the
animals, and the welfare of the public. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable park employee or
attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In an enclosure containing six wallabies, there were six metal rods sticking out of the ground in front of a drain
opening.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***APHIS personnel discovered a decaying rodent carcass on zoo grounds. There was another decomposing rodent
carcass alongside the leopard enclosure.
Disease can be transmitted by dead animals to the regulated animals. In addition, animal carcasses can attract
other pests to the area, which can carry disease and can contaminate feed and water. The facility must remove and
dispose of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead animals, trash and debris.

3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***There were multiple pools of standing water in the Walkthrough aviary, housing an adult Blue duiker. There was a
strong, foul stench coming from the brown, debris-filled water.
Standing water can pose a health risk to the animals as it can contain bacteria and parasites. Additionally, animals
standing in water for excess periods of time are at risk for foot/hoof rot. The facility must have a suitable method to
rapidly eliminate excess water from the enclosures.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
***Three fox exhibits have an indoor and outdoor area of the enclosure that allow for public viewing. During
inspection, two adult Red foxes, two adult Artic foxes, and two adult Gray foxes were displaying nervous, erratic
behavior when the public was in the viewing areas. All of the foxes were agitated, panting, and continuously runningbetween the indoor and outdoor portions of their enclosures. While in the indoor viewing area, they were observed
to be jumping on the walls and running in circles. At no point did APHIS personnel observe the animals to be still.
There were no dens in the enclosures, nor hiding areas where the animals could be out of the view of the public for
any period of time.
This can lead to undue stress to the animals, which is often exhibited through nervous behavior, including pacing,
circling, and running. Animals must be provided an opportunity to make normal postural and social adjustments with
adequate freedom of movement to include resting areas out of direct public view to relieve stress.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
***There were numerous flies on and around the faces of 4 adult llamas and/or alpacas. Several were shaking their
heads. There were several fly traps on the fence, however they were full and not able to provide adequate pest
control.
Excessive amounts of flies on or around the animals can be stressful to the animal. Additionally, disease can be
transmitted by the pests to the animals and they can contaminate feed and water. The facility must establish and
maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote the health and well-being of the animals and
reduce contamination by pests in all animal areas.
