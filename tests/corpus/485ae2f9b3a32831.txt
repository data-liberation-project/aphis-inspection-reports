Facilities, general.
An adult tan and white guinea pig was noted to be loose in the building housing the guinea pigs and was found huddled
under a set of enclosures.

Housing facilities need to be able to contain the animals. Loose animals are susceptible to injury and even death. Correct
by ensuring that enclosures are properly maintained to prevent animal escapes.
3.28(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Pens #58, #59, and the two treatment pens have wood for the floors and side walls that are not sealed and therefore not
impervious to liquids and moisture. Unsealed wood cannot be adequately cleaned or properly sanitized and allows the
absorption of liquids and moisture, which can increase the risk of disease to the guinea pigs housed within them. Correct
by sealing all wood surfaces within the guinea pig enclosures.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
