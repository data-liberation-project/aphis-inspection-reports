Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian was not aware of the current feeding protocols for the large cats. The licensee stated that she
was adding Oasis supplements to the exotic cat's daily diet. The veterinarian should be made aware of the animal's diets
so that he can properly evaluate the animal and offer advice on the care of the animal especially in an aged animal. The
veterinarian was unaware of the this and not familiar with the supplements used. (b)(3) Daily observation of all animals to
assess their health and well-being; Provided, however, That daily observation of animals may be accomplished by
someone other than the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being

is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The supplements were spoiled/degraded and unusable at time of the
inspection. Daily observation must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian to insure the animals are receiving the best
care.

Facilities, general.
The supplies of food and supplements were not stored properly to protect against deterioration, molding, or
contamination by vermin. The meat had a rancid/spoiled odor coming from the freezer and the supplements were black
from degradation. Throughout the feed prep and storage area there were various things scattered about such as old
cardboard boxes which had mold on them. This provides a haven for vermin. This area needs to be cleaned and other
items disposed of properly.

and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet
