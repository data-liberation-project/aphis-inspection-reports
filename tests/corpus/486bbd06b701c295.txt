3.15(a)(1) Critical

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
One adult dog escaped the transport crate and was injured. A 2-year-old female Golden Retriever named "Bella"
escaped from her transport enclosure and was injured on 7/30/2021. The animal was in the pet holding area awaiting
transport on flight 3483 from Seattle to Reno. She was contained in a large plastic “Vari-kennel” type transport enclosure.
The dog was not observed escaping from the enclosure, but was seen running loose by an airport employee. The dog
chewed through the plastic cable tie fasteners used to secure the metal door, forced open the kennel door and escaped
the transport enclosure. She then ran across the tarmac, jumped a fence, and went onto a street outside of the airport
secured area. She was found injured and bleeding by a person who took the dog to a local veterinary hospital for care.

According to one of the veterinarians that treated “Bella” at the clinic, the dog was bleeding from her mouth, had
lacerations to the pads on all four paws, and her nails were broken. The animal was treated and released to the owners
the following day.

Primary enclosures used to transport dogs must be constructed so that the enclosure is strong enough to contain the
animals securely and comfortably and to withstand the normal rigors of transportation, thus preventing their possible


escape and injury.

To be corrected: from this time forward

An exit interview was conducted with the Sr. Policy and Procedures Specialist.
