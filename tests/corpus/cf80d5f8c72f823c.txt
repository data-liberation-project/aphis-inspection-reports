ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Over the last two years, a total of four animals have been found dead in their enclosures in conjunction with recent
cardiac bleeds and a gross necropsy has been performed. The two earlier animals were found dead the day after a
cardiac bleed was performed and the cause of death was recorded as a cardiac tear in July of 2015 (12 previous
cardiac bleeds) and July of 2016 (26 previous cardiac bleeds). In the last four months, two animals have been found
dead in their enclosures. On 23 January 2017, animal 764 (38 previous cardiac bleeds) was found dead, 12 days
after the last cardiac bleed on 11 January 2017 and the necropsy noted "Thorax noted w/ hemorrhage. Cardiac
tampanade. Spontaneous myocardial rupture". On 22 April 2017, animal 781 (4 previous cardiac bleeds) was found
dead, 3 days after a cardiac bleed on 19 April 2017 and the necropsy noted "pericardial sac full of hemorrhage -
secondary to needle sticks most likely".
This recent increase in unexpected mortality related to cardiac abnormalities on necropsy in animals undergoing
repeated cardiac bleeds is a change in the previous pattern. Adequate veterinary care includes guidance regarding
the care and use of animals during the conduct of research. Repeated anesthetized cardiac bleeds is not a widely
used method for survival blood collection in guinea pigs and in conjunction with the recent animal deaths after 4-38
cardiac bleeds in individual animals, additional guidance needs to be provided by the veterinarian regarding the
care and use of animals.
