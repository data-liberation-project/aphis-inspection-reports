HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces--(3) Cleaning.
* Several dog doors have an accumulation of brown to black grime or waste on the metal surfaces. These dog
doors were located in the Main kennel building in several enclosures housing 10 adult dogs. The top row of
enclosures has two enclosures, holding no dogs, with an accumulation of fecal waste on the vinyl wire flooring.
These enclosures where located next to enclosures housing dogs.
* The outside concrete flooring for the Little Kennel, housing 13 adult dogs, has brown to black grime smeared onto
the surface. The lower metal pipe framing for the chain link dividers in these enclosures has an accumulation of
brown to black waste smeared onto the surface. The inside enclosures for the Little Kennel building have an
accumulation of brown to black waste in the corners of the enclosure boxes and smeared on the surface to the dog
door inserts.
The mentioned surfaces indicate that daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. Improper cleaning and sanitization can
cause an accumulation of waste, attract pests, cause odors and increase disease hazards for the dogs. All
surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and must be sanitized according to Section 3.11(b) (3).
Proper cleaning and sanitization will reduce the disease hazards for the dogs.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (f) Drainage and waste disposal.
* The upper and lower wash-downs for the enclosures of the Main Kennel have an accumulation of fecal waste and
fluid waste that has ponded in the wash-down. The wash-downs are concaved in areas that do not let the fluidwaste rapidly drain into the drainage system. This accumulation of fecal and fluid waste can cause pest
infestations, insects, odors and increase the disease hazards for the 12 adult dogs and six puppies. Facility
operators must provide regular and frequent collection of the waste in the wash-downs. The wash-downs must be
constructed and allow for rapid elimination of fecal and fluid waste. More regular and rapid elimination of waste will
minimize odors, pests, insects and diseases for the dogs.
To be corrected by, 30-March-2015.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sec. 3.11 (a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
* The wash-downs for the bottom and top row of enclosures, housing 12 adult dogs and six puppies, have an
accumulation of fecal waste and fluid waste. These wash-downs are located on the Main Kennel. The fecal and
fluid waste can increase insect infestations, pests, odors and increase disease hazards for the dogs. The fecal and
fluid waste must be removed from the wash-downs more often. More frequent removal of the waste will prevent an
accumulation of waste and fluid waste. This will reduce pests, insects, odors and reduce the disease hazards for
the dogs.
