ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**The owner's dog was housed in a pen outside along with a pot belly pig that was being exhibited in the petting
zoo. The dog is not listed as part of the current inventory on the Program of Veterinary Care. Section 2 of the PVC
had not been completed to indicate the current vaccination status of the dog, parasite control, emergency care and
dose/agent to be utilized for method of euthansia. The program of veterinary care should be reviewed and
completed by the attending veterinarian to accurately reflect the current inventory of animals on hand in addition to
the veterinary care that will be provided to the animals housed at the facility.
