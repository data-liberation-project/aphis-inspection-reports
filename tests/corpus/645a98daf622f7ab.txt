ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:05-10:35
on 06-DEC-18.
I went to the facility and was unable to make contact with anyone. I called the number on file and was able to make
contact with the Licensee. He confirmed that no one was available for inspection at that time.
