2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
Patrons were observed interacting with the adult giraffe with no attendant present. The attendant who was supposed to be
present was observed doing chores at another area of the facility. Unsupervised human interaction with animals poses a
risk of injury to the humans and to the animals. Per the regulations, a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable
employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. Correct by December 30, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
