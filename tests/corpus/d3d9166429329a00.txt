ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two aged camels, Came and Sanchi, are arthritic and seem sore and reluctant to move. They haven't been
evaluated by a veterinarian for this to determine if treatment is necessary.
Arthritis is common in older animals, and there may be options for treatment to help the animals be more
comfortable. These animals should be evaluated and treated as determined appropriate by the Attending
Veterinarian (AV).
Three adult donkeys are obese, with heavily crested necks and excess fat along the back and rump. At least two of
them have misshapen front hooves consistent with chronic founder. None appear to be lame at this time. A female
orphan foal with the jenny by the house appears to be unthrifty; she looks thin and has a scruffy haircoat.
It is reported that none of these have been evaluated by the AV for these conditions. Obesity in donkeys
predisposes them to various health problems like laminitis. Acute laminitis is not only painful, it can be
life-threatening. A management plan to reduce weight to reduce the risk of obesity-related health problems needs to
be formulated with the AV. The foal needs to be evaluated to determine if intervention is necessary to help improve
her health status.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The shelter in the enclosure housing four camels behind the house is damaged so that several sheet metal panels
are bowed out, exposing sharp edges that could injure the animals. Repairing the panels and reinforcing the interior
to prevent further damage will help prevent injury to the animals.
