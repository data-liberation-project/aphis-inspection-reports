INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The floor in an occupied kennel in room 41J has a patch where the surface treatment has been damaged to the
point it is no longer impervious to moisture. Unsealed surfaces are not readily cleaned or sanitized, and can retain
odors and harbor pathogens.
Correct immediately by moving the animal to a kennel unaffected by defects in surface coatings. Discontinue using
the affected kennel(s) until repairs are made.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
A squirt bottle used to provide a honey water reward for the grizzly bears was improperly labeled. It was a
pre-printed laboratory bottle for ethanol. All food products not in their original containers must be clearly labeled with
contents and any other information necessary to determine quality.
Food treats improperly labeled as an entirely different product could result in errors in use.
Correct immediately by properly labeling containers with contents.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Facility and IACUC personnel.
