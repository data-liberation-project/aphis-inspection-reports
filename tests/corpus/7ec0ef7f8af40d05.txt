FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*** A shed currently housing rehab animals and licensed squirrels and a woodchuck has the windows on the same
wall as the door. There are no windows or method of ventilation on the opposite walls to create a cross flow of air.
This can be dangerous in the summer months when the temperature is high. This needs to be addressed for the
health of the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** A section of the perimeter fence around the porcupine enclosure and fisher enclosure is separated from the post
creating a large opening. This section of fence needs to be reattached to keep the area in good repair and for the
safety and containment of the animals at the facility.

SANITATION.
*** The facility has a lot of miscellaneous items, clutter and trash in the main area around animal enclosures. This is
creating areas for pests to live and does not promote good housekeeping practices. n addition there is an
overgrowth of weeds in the area that needs to be trimmed. Weed growth creates areas for pests to breed and live.
*** The old fox and squirrel enclosure have been empty for several weeks but have yet to be cleaned. This is
causing strong odors around the area. Empty enclosures should be cleaned in a timely manner to keep the area
clean and facilitate good husbandry practices.
