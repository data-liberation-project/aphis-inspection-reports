SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
- The ambient temperature in the sheltered portion of the kennel was above 85 degrees F. The initial
measurements taken at approximately 2:10 PM showed temperatures ranging from 90.4 F to 93.7 F in different
parts of the building. An additional measurement taken approximately one hour later showed an ambient
temperature of 93.9 F. The environmental temperature at the time of inspection was 91 F. The licensee had
several fans inside the shelter, and had the kennel doors open for ventilation. All dogs in this section of the kennel
are adult animals. The majority of the dogs were panting and laying or standing close to the fans but none of the
dogs appeared to be in significant heat distress at the time of the inspection. Excessive heat can cause a number
of health problems, ranging from physical discomfort to heat exhaustion and even death in extreme cases. The
licensee must take steps to ensure that the temperature in the sheltered building can be controlled and maintained
at no more than 85 degrees F.
