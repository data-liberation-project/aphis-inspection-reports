Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
* The following medications used to treat the dogs at the facility have gone past their labeled expiration dates. The
recorded expiration date on one bottle of Pet tabs was 05/21. The recorded expiration date on one bottle of
Metoclopramide Oral was 1/28/21. These medications are intermingled with other products that are currently being used
at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on
regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary
care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated to animals could
be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may
experience pain, distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms or unexpected side effects. Failure to properly label
medications or other medical products as being expired and storing them with unexpired medical materials could lead to
the unintentional use on regulated animals. The licensee must either dispose of all such expired medical drugs and
materials or segregate them in an appropriately labeled, physically separate location from non-expired medical drugs and
materials. Correct by 10/5/21.

* No expiration dates were recorded on one bottle of Panacur liquid and one bottle of Ponazuril liquid. These
medications were intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and is therefore ready for

use. These medications were obtained from the attending veterinarian. Medications must be labeled with appropriate
and accurate information to ensure that the contents of the container can be known with certainty. The effectiveness and
expected results could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated if the expiration date is unknown. The
usage of any medication with an unknown expiration date on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable
veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The licensee must ensure that all medications used
in the facility have a current expiration date recorded. Correct by 10/5/21.
