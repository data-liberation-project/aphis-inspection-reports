*** Chemicals, tools, and other miscellaneous supplies are being stored on top of enclosures in both the whelping
and addult areas. Chemicals or tools falling into the enclosures below could injure the dogs or cause harm from
them ingesting the chemicals. Correct this by ensuring all chemicals, tools, and other items are not stored on top of
primary enclosures. These items must be properly stored utilizing cabinets or shelving.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Rodent droppings were found in a plastic bin stored on top of the primary enclosures in the adult dog area. Rodent
feces can be a source of disease in animals. An effective pest control program needs to be established and
maintained to prevent mammalian pest activity within the dog areas. Correct this by establishing a program to
control these pests.
