ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two female sugar gliders have eye issues today. One has a cloudy and possibly shrunken right eye, which she is
holding open. Another female has swelling below the right eye and will not open her eye. The manager has not
made health checks this week due to being out except for some quick facility checks, and the other caretaker did
not notice these eyes, as the gliders are not always out of their sleeping cups when the food and water are being
changed out.
Eye issues and facial swellings can have numerous causes, some of which may be painful, therefore these medical
issues need to be noted and evaluated as soon as possible.
These gliders need to be evaluated for a diagnosis and treatment by the Attending Veterinarian. The veterinarian's
office was called during this inspection and the veterinarian can see these gliders tonight.
To be corrected by 8-2-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the manager.
