*** A French bulldog id # 9320001000584541 named "Caramel" has a mammary gland that is enlarged and does
not appear normal. In addition, her right ear is dirty and the ear is swollen and potentially fluid filled and she shook
her head repeatedly during the inspection. This indicated that her ear was bothering her and her condition should be
communicated to the vet and she should be assessed by the vet for diagnosis and best course of treatment. This
needs to be addressed for her comfort and health.
