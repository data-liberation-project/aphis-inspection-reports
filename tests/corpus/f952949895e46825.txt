ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:00 pm on
14-AUG-19.
Attempted to make contact by phone at 4:20 pm and was told that licensee was not available and I should call back
after 6:00 pm. I attempted to call at 6:30 pm and left a message by voicemail. Please contact me with updated
business status. I am providing my business card with this report.
