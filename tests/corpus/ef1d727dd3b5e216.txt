2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records documenting the acquisition of animals were inaccurate. The acquisition records for the ringtail
lemurs and an artic wolf were not recorded and the inventory count was incorrect. The exhibitor shall make, keep
and maintain records or forms which correctly disclose the information of these animals. The records shall include
offspring born of any animals while in his possession or under his control. Correct from this day forward.
This was a focused inspection of the records and veterinary care issues from the previous inspection. The ringtail
lemur and black-handed spider monkeys' lesions have improved and the owner has been following up with the
attending veterinarian on their conditions.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner.
