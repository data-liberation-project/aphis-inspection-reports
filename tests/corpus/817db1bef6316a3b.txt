2.126(c) CRITICAL REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
In accordance with 2.126(c) a written itinerary shall be submitted to the Regional Director at
ACWest@aphis.usda.gov no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate
information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's
approved site. As defined in the regulation, the itinerary shall include the following:
(i) The name of the person who intends to exhibit the animal and transport the animal for exhibition purposes,
including any business name and current Act license or registration number and, in the event that any animal is
leased, borrowed, loaned, or under some similar arrangement, the name of the person who owns such animal;
(ii) The name, identification number or identifying characteristics, species (common or scientific name), sex and age
of each animal; and
(iii) The names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the animals will travel, be housed, and be exhibited,
including all anticipated dates and locations (with addresses) for any stops and layovers that allow or require
removal of the animals from the transport enclosures. Unanticipated delays of such length shall be reported to the
AC Regional Director the next APHIS business day. APHIS Regional offices are available each weekday, except on
Federal holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
As a Class C exhibitor with no reported primary site, submitting an itinerary for the traveling animals is crucial to
ensuring that the animals are maintained in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. There have been no
itineraries submitted to the AC Director or ACWest@aphis.usda.gov since 2016. Online records and news articles
identified the licensees exhibiting their Fido 500 show at the Ventura County Fair (Aug 1-12, 2018), the Western
Idaho Fair (Aug 17-26, 2018) and the Twin Falls County Fair (Aug 19-Sep 3, 2018). The news articles on the
Ventura and Twin Falls Fairs include interviews with the licensees, and the Western Idaho Fair schedule includes
multiple Fido 500 shows a day. The Inspector left a message for the licensee on October 11, 2018, requesting an
itinerary or location in order to inspect the facility with no response.
