ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the Barn, there is a brown and white female English Bulldog (microchip #007 067 628) that was observed to be
walking with a stiff gait. Upon closer inspection both of the dog's front legs were slightly swollen beneath the elbow
joints. Both front legs had lacerations and puncture wounds in the swollen areas. Licensee had not noticed this
dog's condition but thought she must have gotten into a fight with the other dog in her enclosure. This dog has not
been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. Lacerations, puncture wounds and swelling can cause pain and
discomfort to the dog as well as pose further health risks.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Diagnosis and
treatment plan must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. At the conclusion of the
inspection the licensee had spoken with the attending veterinarian about this dog.
