veterinarian, one within 48hrs and two within two weeks from the date of the 11/13/14 inspection.
The results of the visit to the veterinarin was a round of restricted exercise and medication for the Borzoi known as

exercise and a new medication and toe nail trimming which will be followed with a re-examination upon completion
of the medication run.
An appointment for the other two dogs "Barzoi" a 6 hear old male Borzoi and 'Apache" a 3 year old male Border
Collie following the initial examination by the new ATV is being scheduled to address the tarter and broken teeth
issues.
