Male Pomeranian (#3) has poor dental health. The majority of the surface of the upper front teeth and canine teeth on
both sides of the mouth are encased in a dark brown colored material. The entire surface of the upper and lower cheek
teeth on both sides of the mouth are completely encased in a dark brown colored material. A line of grey, milky, pus-like
material is located along the gum line above the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth. The gums are slightly
reddened and inflamed above the upper canine teeth on both sides of the mouth.

Male Australian Shepherd (#11) has poor dental health. The majority of the surface of the upper cheek teeth on both the
left and right side of the mouth are completely encased in a thick yellow to brown colored material. The gums appear
inflamed and are moderately reddened.

Female Aussie Doodle (#5) has an abnormal appearance to her face. Complete hair loss is located on the entire bridge
of the nose and there is multi-focal hair loss located around both eyes. The skin appears dry, crusty, flaky and irritated.
Inflammation of the skin is located around the entire left eye along with an excessive clear discharge from the inner corner
of the eye. The right eye has a small area of hair loss and skin inflammation located along the inner area of the eye along
with excessive discharge from the inner corner.


Female Shiba Inu (#42) has an abnormal condition of the right hind leg. The inspectors observed the dog to be
inconsistently non-weight bearing on the right hind leg as well as toe touching when standing. Closer inspection revealed
an area of inflammation on the lower leg which included the toes.

Poor dental health and abnormal skin and leg conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the animal as well as lead to
further health issues.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The license must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
