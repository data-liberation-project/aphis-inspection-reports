3.26(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
When entering the primary building where the hamsters were stored, there was a smell of ammonia at the entry of
the facility. The odor was most offensive when first entering the building, and was less noticeable in the areas where
there were AC units and other methods of ventilation (fans).
Additional ventilation is needed to reduce these odors throughout the facility and provide the animals with fresh air.
