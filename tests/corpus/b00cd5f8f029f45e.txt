ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care***
Two adult English Bulldogs were observed with excessively long toenails on the front feet. These toenails were
over 1/2 inch in length and were starting hook on the ends. Excessively long toenails are prone to foot injury and
may cause pain, distress and potential infections. These toenails must be trimmed to reduce the risk of breakage or
hanging of the nails and thus creating unnecessary veterinary care risks. The affected dogs, microchip numbers
018-632-265 and 037-533-292, should be trimmed as well as any other dogs with excessively long toenails. A
program of routinely trimming toenails should be followed to prevent this condition in the future. To be corrected by:

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***Wind and rain breaks***
Two shelters in the outdoor kennel area in enclosures containing one Boston Terrier each were observed without
sufficient wind and rain break structures at the entrance to the shelter. The lack of a wind and rain break on a
shelter allows the bedding to become wet and is not conducive to the creation of a dead air space within the shelter.
This significantly limits the affected dogs' ability to conserve body heat. All outdoor shelters must have measures in
place to restrict to the entrance to the shelter of wind and rain. To be corrected by: 01/31/15

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***Shelter from elements***
Two outdoor enclosures, containing three adult Cocker Spaniels each, were observed with single igloo-type
shleters. These shelters do not provide sufficient space to allow all dogs enough space to enter, turn around and lie
down freely at the same time. All outside enclosures must be provided with shelters that provide adequate space
for all dogs contained to enter the shelter and make normal postural adjustments simultaneously. To be corrected
by: 01/31/15This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility owner.
