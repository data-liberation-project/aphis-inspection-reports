INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
As approved in protocol 17-003, the investigator performs a major operative survival procedure followed by a major
operative terminal procedure on armadillos. The armadillos are frequently acquired from a different facility with an
implanted ibutton device intra-abdominally. The protocol contains measures for an additional procedure to retrieve
the ibutton if the previous investigator needs them returned before surgical procedures can be scheduled. The
protocol is not clear in its description of ibutton retrieval but upon questioning, it became clear that the retrieval
process must enter the abdominal cavity. Procedures that enter the abdominal cavity are major operative
procedures. Under this protocol, three armadillos, DN92 on 7/11/18 and DN91 and DN94 on 7/12/18, underwent
two major operative procedures from which they were allowed to recover before undergoing a 3rd terminal
operation. No animal shall be used in more than one major operative procedure from which it is allowed to recover
unless justified in writing for scientific reasons, required for routine or emergent veterinary care, or approved by the
APHIS administrator. If protocols are unclear, the IACUC shall take measures to clarify as needed, to determine if
proposed activities use animals in more than one survival procedure without written justification or administrator
approval. Correct from this day forward.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In review of the IACUC meeting minutes and reports over the last year, there has been no annual review of current
and continuing protocols. The IACUC inspects the facility and reviews the care of the animals but does not review
the protocols nor associated procedure records in order to identify any deviations. For example, Protocol 17-003
states that armadillos will be euthanized during a terminal surgery with an overdose of barbiturate. However, two
armadillos, DN87 on 3/30/18 and DN85 on 3/31/18, were euthanized at the completion of the procedure by
administering an overdose of the anesthetic drug Propofol. Propofol overdose is not a method of euthanasia that
has been approved by the IACUC for this protocol. Without continued oversight and review of activities involving
animals by the IACUC, the welfare of research animals may be jeopardized as a result of unidentified deviations
and unmonitored activities. The IACUC shall conduct continuing reviews of all activities in covered species at least
annually. Correct from this day forward.This inspection was conducted with the principal investigator and the exit interview was conducted with the
institutional research compliance officer.
