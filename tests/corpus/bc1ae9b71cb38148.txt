2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC approved protocol 1244 did not contain a complete description of the activities using animals. The protocol
stated that an adjuvant would be administered to rabbits but did not state which adjuvant would be used. A later
modification to the protocol stated that Freund's Complete adjuvant would be used. A second modification added an
additional adjuvant injection for a group of rabbits, stating that "The same methods for injection will be used. The
material to be injected will be the same as the initial boost injections; DNA plasmid with adjuvant." The adjuvant was
not identified in the modification. The investigator was contacted and stated that a different adjuvant was used for
injections subsequent to the initial Freund's Comlete adjuvant.
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that animal activities are in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. In
order to perform this function, a complete description of activities using animals must be included in protocols prior
to IACUC approval. The facility should ensure that all protocols contain complete descriptions of animal use.
