HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open bag of marshmallows was stored on a table in a room adjacent to the marmoset enclosures where they are
given their food. The marshmallows were stored in class jar with no lid, using a metal bowl as a cover instead.
Immediately beside them was an opened bag of mouse bait.
Rodenticides contain ingredients that can be very toxic if ingested, causing great harm to nonhuman primates.
Furthermore, food must be stored in a manner that protects it from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation.
Open food not in use must be kept in leak-proof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and
contamination. And substances that are toxic to nonhuman primates, but are required for normal husbandry
practices, must not be stored in food storage and preparation areas.

WATERING.
One marmoset enclosure contained dirty pink-tinged, drinking water. In addition, one kinkajou and one fennec fox
enclosure both contained water receptacles with discolored, cloudy build-up and some staining of the water bowl
itself.
Contaminated water can cause illness, as well as serve as a reservoir for disease. Potable water must be provided
to every animal housed at the facility. Water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A fennec fox enclosure containing two foxes with a nesting box that was falling apart along one edge. The nesting
box was made of both wooden and metal panels. The metal siding of one edge was seen propped up on its side,
exposing sharp edges. The top metal surface of the box possessed a hole for entry. Its edges were jagged andraised.
Such objects that are not properly maintained can injure the animals housed, and their hide can be injured on the
sharp points.
Housing facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the species involved.
The facility must have a system of maintenance such that all structures and devices remain structurally sound and
in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

SANITATION.
Two kinkajou enclosures (containing two kinkajous each) had increased amounts of decomposing food and excreta,
with a large number of flies swarming the debri on the floor of the enclosure. The licensee stated that the animal
keeper cleans out each primary enclosure once weekly, but had been awhile since he was able to come out to the
premise. Licensee confirmed that the one keeper is solely responsible for cleaning the enclosures; so if he is not
there they do not get cleaned.
The accumulation of excreta and decaying food can pose health risks to the animals by contaminating the enclosure
themselves and attracting unwanted wildlife and vermin that may carry diseases.
Licensee should have a practice in place to ensure husbandry standards are met in accordance with the animal
welfare regulations. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards reduce odors.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
All kinkajou enclosures contained excessive accumulation of decomposing food and excreta, swarming with flies.
The fennec fox enclosures had a buildup of excreta outside of their litter boxes. The licensee stated that he only has
one animal keeper who cleans the enclosures once weekly. Today, the licensee couldn’t recall the last time the
animal keeper had been to the facility, and that it had been awhile. When the keeper is unavailable, the licensee
confirmed the enclosures are not cleaned at all.
Deficiencies in animal care due to inadequate staffing, such as the buildup of debris or contaminated drinking water
may pose disease hazards, as well as cause odors, attracting other animals and vermin. A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level
of husbandry practices.
