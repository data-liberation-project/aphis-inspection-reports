Facilities, general.
* An accumulation of fecal waste was observed covering the floor area in four different enclosures. Two degus and six
chinchillas are in contact with the affected enclosure flooring located in indoor housing. Fecal waste can become a
disease hazard or area of contamination to the animals. In addition, waste odors can have an adverse effect on the
health and well-being of the animals. Provision shall be made by the licensee for the removal and disposal of animal and
food wastes, bedding, dead animals, trash, and debris. Correct by 10/20/22.

* The solid flooring in one stack cage unit does not cover the entire enclosure flooring. There is an estimated six-inch
area of missing flooring that could allow animal waste, urine, floor shavings or spilled food to fall into the enclosure below.
Two Chinchillas are in contact with the affected enclosure missing flooring which is located in indoor housing. Unsanitary
conditions exist that can affect the health and well-being of the animals. The potential disease or health risks exist when
anything from one enclosure falls into another enclosure. The licensee must provide for the regular and frequent
collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks.
