ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An itinerary submitted to the Department listed an event in Fort Wayne, IN on Jan 24-26, 2020. The only event in
Fort Wayne, IN during that time frame was the Shrine Circus at the Coliseum. Inspectors were on site to inspect the
tiger exhibition but could not conduct an inspection as the exhibitor was not present. A complete and accurate
itinerary was not submitted by the licensee. A complete itinerary must include locations with addresses for any
locations and any changes to the itinerary must be submitted within 48 hours to provide adjusted location
documentation.
Failure to provide and update itinerary information results in the Department's inability to conduct an inspection to
ensure the welfare of the animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act.
Provide an accurate itinerary that includes addresses for locations of all exhibitions within 48 hours of receiving this
notice.
