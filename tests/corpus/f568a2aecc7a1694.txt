2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not include the Red Fox or other species (sugar glider) that were
previously present at facility. The Attending Veterinarian has not visited the facility or reviewed/updated the existing
PVC since December 2016.
Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current
practices or species present at the facility or that the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary
care to all animals. Failure to conform to these requirements could have a negative impact on the health and
well-being of the animals.
The written Program of Veterinary Care should be reviewed and updated at least once per year and should address
all species. The Attending Veterinarian should visit the site and provide guidance on animal care issues for all
species on a regular basis; at minimum annually. The facility should work with the Attending Veterinarian(s) to
update the written Program of Veterinary Care, schedule regular visits with the Attending Veterinarian, and ensure
that the animal care procedures outlined in the written Program of Veterinary Care are followed, in order to advance
the health and well-being of the animals. To be corrected by 3/10/18.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
