ANNUAL REPORT.
The facility annual report filed in November 2016 for fiscal year 2016 incorrectly reports 119 non-human primates,
12 guinea pigs and 8 rabbits used in Category C as research conducted involving no pain, distress or pain-relieving
drugs. The facility stated that a transcription error occurred and all animals reported in Category C should have
been reported in Category D indicating research involved potential accompanying pain or distress and appropriate
anesthetic, analgesic or tranquilizing drugs were used.
A corrected annual report should be filed with the appropriate Animal Care office accurately reflecting animal use
numbers in appropriate categories for fiscal year 2016 as required under the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct by: September 10, 2017.
The inspection was conducted with Executive Director ACO and IACUC coordinator. The exit interview was
conducted with research compliance staff, IACUC veterinarian and Executive Director ACO.
