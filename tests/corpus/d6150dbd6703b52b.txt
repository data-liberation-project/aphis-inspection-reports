ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30pm on
16-May-17.
Records were available at the office, however we need to inspect the animals and the licensee reported scheduled
obligations for the day that would not allow him to accompany us to the facility for an inspection.
Additional Inspectors
Wilken Kevin, Animal Care Inspector
