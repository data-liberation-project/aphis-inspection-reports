FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Five goats, one pig, and one black buck antelope were housed on open ground at the top of the hill during this
inspection. The ambient temperature was 41 degrees Fahrenheit and the wind was gusting above 20 MPH creating
a wind chill below 31 degrees. The wind was projected to continue thru the night as temperatures dropped. Wind
breaks were available for all animals but did not appear to sufficiently shelter them from inclement weather (wind).
The owner stated that he could move the animals indoors. Inadequate shelter can lead to discomfort in the animals
and increase their suceptability to disease. Correct by providing natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local
climatic conditions for the species concerned. Correct by the end of the day 21 November 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
