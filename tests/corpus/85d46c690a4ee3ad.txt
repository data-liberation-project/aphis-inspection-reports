ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1 p.m. on

This pet shop is closed, however the USDA license is still active. I contacted the licensee during the last attempted
inspection to notify USDA in writing of the change of business. No change of business has been received by to the
eastern regional office.
