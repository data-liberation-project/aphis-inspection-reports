3.6(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
1. A hole was observed in the wooden floor in an enclosure housing 2 dogs. This could lead to injury since the hole was
large enough to allow the dogs' legs to fall through. Enclosures must be kept in good repair to avoid injury to the animals.

2. A piece of wood serving as a support beam in one enclosure was observed with worn jagged edges. In addition, the
tips of 2 screws were exposed and facing into the enclosure. This condition could injure the dogs. The enclosure needs to
be kept in good repair in order to protect the dogs from injury. The screws were removed and this was corrected at the
time of inspection.
