3.52(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor rabbit enclosures were positioned into eight rows. The outermost enclosures of at least four rows did
not have a rain/snow break to protect the animals from the wind, rain or snow. The shelter holding the eight rows of
enclosures currently have plastic sheeting which provides protection from the wind, rain, and snow on three sides
with a few rows having protection on all four sides. The licensee must ensure that all animals are adequately
protected from the adverse or extreme weather conditions on all sides of their enclosures. These animals must have
adequate shelter to protect them from the wind, rain, snow and other inclement weather.
All veterinary care directs listed on the April 27, 2015 inspection report were corrected.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
