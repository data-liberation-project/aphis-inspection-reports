3.4(b)(4) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two shelters in the outdoor enclosures, housing a total of 2 Dachsunds and 3 Corgis, did not contain sufficient
bedding material for the temperature at the time of the inspection, which was 35F degrees. The straw in one shelter
was matted to about 1" thick and there was matted feces inside the entrance of the shelter. There was not enough
bedding material in the other shelter to cover the floor. The owner stated that he had placed fresh bedding material
in the shelters 5 days before and that the dogs kicked it out. During the previous 5 days, temperatures at night have
been less than 20F degrees and daytime temperatures have been less than 35F degrees. Lack of sufficient bedding
in cold environments increases the risks of sickness and hypothermia situations. Sufficient clean dry bedding
material is necessary to provide protection when the temperature is less than 50F degrees. More bedding material
is necessary when the temperature is less than 35F degrees for the dogs to burrow into and remain clean and dry
and have better protection from the cold. The owner must provide more bedding for the dogs and maintain it at
sufficient levels any time the temperature is less than 50F degrees and additional bedding must be added when the
temperature is less than 35F degrees.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: From this point forward.
Licensee was verbally instructed to provide more bedding before the end of the day.
Exit interview done with facility representative.
