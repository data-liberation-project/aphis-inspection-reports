Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
During the inspection, various accumulations of clutter were observed throughout the fenced-in area surrounding one of
the buildings that houses animals. Additionally, there was evidence of a black-colored mold on both doors and within a
storage cabinet in the other animal housing facility.

The accumulation of clutter can create breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin. Accumulations
of clutter and mold can create a health hazard for animals at the facility.

Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate husbandry practices. Premises must be kept clean and free
of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products, and discarded matter.

3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.


Two female intact two-year-old Dachshunds, “Bella” and “Beauty,” had not been treated in alignment with the Program of
Veterinary Care. Specifically, the Program and previous rabies certificates indicated that rabies vaccinations were due
one year following the previous vaccine administration, but the date had passed and the dogs had not been vaccinated
yet at the time of inspection.

The Program of Veterinary Care must be followed. Operating a breeding dog kennel without providing the required care
per the Attending Veterinarian can create unhealthy environments, including creation of the potential for increased
susceptibility to contagious diseases of dogs and other conditions that can negatively affect canine health.

The applicant must follow the Attending Veterinarian's Program of Veterinary Care, including vaccines against deadly
diseases of dogs.
