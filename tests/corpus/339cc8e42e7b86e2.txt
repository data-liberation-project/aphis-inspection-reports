2.31(e)(4) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The cigarette smoke exposure protocol did not include an adequate description of the procedures designed to assure that
discomfort and pain to animals would be limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of the research. The protocol
had poorly described the guidelines for closely monitoring the ferrets during the study. It was determined that there were
no specific parameters or signs described to properly evaluate the health and well-being of the animals during the
administration of the smoke that would alert the observer of any pain and/or distress exhibited such as discomfort, uneven
breathing or cessation of breathing. The fact that there were no specific parameters in place to properly evaluate the
physical state allowed the oversight of 3 ferrets succumbing to the lack of appropriately mixed air/smoke exposure without
any intervention in a timely manner. There needs to be a more effective and precise way to monitor the health of the
animals while receiving cigarette smoke/air to prevent the likelihood of another animal being misevaluated to prevent the
animals from experiencing unnecessary pain and distress and/or death. The cigarette smoke exposure protocol must
contain a description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to the animals will be limited to that which
is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research. Correct by 3/24/2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, IACUC Chair, IACUC Director,
Associate VP Research Regulatory Office and Associate IACUC Director.
