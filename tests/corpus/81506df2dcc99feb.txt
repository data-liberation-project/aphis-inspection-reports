*A red adult female Shiba Inu who was not identified with an official USDA tag was observed to have a problem with
her left eye. The eye appeared to be normal in size and did not display any bulging; however the entire eye was
white and cloudy. This condition may be causing undue pain and discomfort to the animal. The animal must be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian and the prescribed treatment must be administered.

*A red adult male Shiba Inu official USDA tag number 005 was observed to have an injury to the left side of his face
just below his eye in the cheek/upper lip area. The wound was approximately one inch long by about half inch wide
and appeared to be shallow in depth. The flesh of the wound was red and looked dry except for a small area in the
center of the injury that still appeared to be moist. Failure to have the issue addressed by the attending veterinarian
can result in additional pain and discomfort to the animal. The animal must be evaluated by the attending
veterinarian and the prescribed treatment must be administered.

2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Approximately half of the dogs were observed to not be wearing official USDA identification tags. Lack of official
USDA tags on the animals does not allow for proper identification or trace backs of the animals. Licensee must
identify all dogs over 16 weeks of age on the premise with official USDA tags.
