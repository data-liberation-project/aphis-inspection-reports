ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are containers of Toltrazuril and Aquazole with no instructions from a licensed veterinarian for correct use in
dogs. These medications are being stored in the treatment area of the whelping building along with other
medications. Incorrect use of medications can result in unwanted side effects and ineffective treatment. All
medications must be labeled and administered properly as part of the facility(cid:25)s programs of adequate veterinary
care. To be corrected by 24 July 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The wire on the top of an enclosure in the smaller of the two buildings on the eastern edge of the facility is broken.
This metal has been pulled down toward the interior of the enclosure resulting in sharp points that are exposed to
the dogs. Exposed sharp metal points can cause injury to the dogs. The licensee must maintain primary enclosures
so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs. To be corrected by 18 July 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
