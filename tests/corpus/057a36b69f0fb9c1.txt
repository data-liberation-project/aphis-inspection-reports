The Records of Animals on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) was not complete at the time of inspection. There were 34
dogs listed on the Records of Animals on Hand. The licensee stated that seven dogs "Trigger", "Cheyenne",
"Tommie", "Moris", "Taylor", "Bella" and "Tracy" had departed the facility, but were still listed on the Records of
Animals on Hand form. Physical Inventory of animals present during time of inspection was 40 dogs. Licensee had
recently acquired 13 dogs, but had not added them to the Records of Animals on Hand form.
There were no Record of Disposition (APHIS Form 7006) available which fully and correctly disclosed the required
information for six dogs "Cheyenne", "Trigger", "Tommie", "Bella", "Moris" and "Tracy" that were sold and no longer
at the facility.
Maintaining current records of animals on hand, including those acquired and disposed of, is required to accurately
track the movement of animals and to facilitate the inspection process.
Make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding the
acquisition and disposition of all the dogs.
