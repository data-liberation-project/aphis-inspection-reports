2.1(a)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This facility was previously licensed under 21-B-0187.
However, the license was not renewed and has since been canceled.
I conducted a search to see if any regulated activity was being conducted. At the time of the inspection 1 sugar
glider was on the premise. Promotional material, to buy other sugar gliders, was also on display.
Therefore, a USDA (cid:28)B(cid:29) Dealer license will need to be obtained.
An exit briefing was conducted with a store employee.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY CAN TAKE PLACE UNTIL A USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
