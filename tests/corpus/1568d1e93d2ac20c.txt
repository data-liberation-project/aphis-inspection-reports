FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the northwestern wolf enclosure, the wolves have dug and exposed a significant area of buried panel fencing.
The buried panel fencing is in place to prevent the wolves from digging beneath their enclosure fencing. The
exposed portion of the panel measures approximately 6 feet wide by 2 feet in length by 1 foot deep and is located
directly in front of a den box. The wolves could potentially injure themselves in/on the exposed area of panel.
Repair or rebury the area of exposed panel.
