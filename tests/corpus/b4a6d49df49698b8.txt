3.137(a)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
5 plastic containers each containing 1 hedgehog had ventilation openings on the top but not on any of the sides.
Adequate ventilation is essential for animal health and survival during transport and holding. Containers with inadequate
ventilation may result in animal discomfort or death if ventilation openings become obstructed. Correct by 07/09/2021 by
using only containers that meet or exceed the regulatory requirements for ventilation.
3.137(e)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
Transport containers containing 5 hedgehogs, a fennec fox, and a chinchilla were not labelled with "live animals", "wild
animals", or directional arrows. “Live animal” signage, with directional arrows, protects animals in transport cages/crates
by identifying the contents of the carrier as living animals and alerting personnel to the correct upright orientation of the
cage or crate.
Correct by July 9th, 2021, by maintaining animals in enclosures that are labelled with the words “live animal” or “wild
animal” (whichever is appropriate) in letters not less than 1 inch in height, with arrows or other markings to indicate the
correct upright position of the container.
