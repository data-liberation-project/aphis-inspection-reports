HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During this inspection it was noted that the river otter was being transferred from a temporary / transport enclosure
into her larger den. However, when the staff member tried to align the door of the temporary enclosure with the door
of the den there was an approximately 6" gap around the entire door. The staff member placed a shovel on the right
side of the door, and a broom on the left side of the door to try to minimize the size of the gap. To ensure that the
otter is transferred between the two holding enclosures without any injuries or escapes, this situation will need to be
addressed.

2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On the previous inspection (3/16/17) this situation was documented. The river otter exhibit is constructed of a
cement wall that varies in height due to the topography of the land that it is on. On the back side of the exhibit it is
approximately 4' high. There is also an approximately 2' tall chain link fence secured to the top of the wall. However,
there are no other precautions present to keep the public from gaining access into the exhibit. This chain link
section, on the wall, is not of sufficient height to assure the safety of the animal. A correction date of October 1,
2017 was given. However, the facility owners have not addressed this exhibit. The situation remains the same. The
height of the exhibit wall is not sufficient to ensure the safety of the otter. This will need to be addressed.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the previous inspection (3/16/17) this situation was documented. During the inspection it was noted that the
concrete wall of the river otter exhibit was in need of attention. Half of the exhibit is dry land / den box, while the
other half has a pool. The concrete was severely cracked along the water line of this pool.
There was also a leaking water line within the wall that may be undermining the integrity of this wall. At the time ofthis inspection (11/30/17) the repairs had just been started that morning to fix the leaking water line. However the
repairs were not finished by the time I left the property. Again, this facility was given until October 1, 2017 to
address the exhibit. However, the owners of the property have not completely addressed the issue. To ensure the
integrity of the wall this will need to be addressed.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a representative of the licensee.
