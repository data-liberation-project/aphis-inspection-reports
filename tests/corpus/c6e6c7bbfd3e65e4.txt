Facilities, outdoor.
Two guinea pigs are currently housed outdoors. The facility has not obtained prior approval for such housing. Guinea pigs
are very sensitive to both heat and cold. Their housing must be designed to protect the guinea pigs from both heat and
cold extremes to avoid putting their health at risk and causing them discomfort. The facility must not house the guinea
pigs outdoors unless such facilities are located in an appropriate climate and the facility has received approval from the
Deputy Administrator. Correct by Jan. 21, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the license.
