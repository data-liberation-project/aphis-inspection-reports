2.1
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
Dr Jessica Gowins and I conducted a search on this facility on September 20, 2016.
At this time 2 goats, 2 sheep, and 10 rabbits are on display to this public. Therefore, a USDA license will be needed.
We spoke to Jonathan Kirschner, Director of Agriculture, and explained the requirement for a USDA Class "C"
Exhibitor license.
He was unaware of the need for a license, but would let the Program Director and Executive Director know that this
was needed.
An exit briefing was conducted with the Director of Agriculture.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES CAN BE CONDUCTED UNTIL LICENSED WITH THE USDA.
Additional Inspectors
Gowins Jessica, Veterinary Medical Officer
