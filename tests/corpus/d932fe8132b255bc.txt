ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On today’s inspection, a white female chaweeni puppy born on 8/12/2019 was noticed to be sitting in the corner of
the whelping box as its litter mate ran around. After watching the puppies for a few minutes, it was apparent that
the puppy was not moving or as active as the other puppy due to an impairment of her hind legs. She would try to
move around, but was unable to rise to her feet as her legs remained curved up under her, stiff and non-weight
bearing. She would inch around on her belly after several attempts to use her hind legs. At one point the Licensee
tried to coax the puppy to move and she cried out after several attempts of being unable to rise to her feet and walk.
There was a total of 4 puppies in this litter, 2 of the litter mates are identified on the cage card as dying from
unknown causes on 8/20/2019. The Licensee did not communicate with the Attending Veterinarian after ½ of the
litter died un-expectantly 8 days after birth. In addition, the Licensee did not notice the hind leg issue with this
puppy. Failure to preform daily observation and identify health concerns, such as this, delays the process of
providing appropriate veterinarian care to animals that are in dire need and can prolong an animal’s pain and
discomfort. The Licensee must have methods in place for daily observation of all animals. In addition, the Licensee
must ensure that there are mechanisms of direct and frequent communication in place and that timely and accurate
information on problems, to include the dog identified above, of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed
to the attending veterinarian.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
On today's inspection there are 18 dogs that are being housed in outside enclosures. All of the outside enclosures
have shelter structures that do not have a wind break/rain break at the entrance. Without having the wind/rain
break at the entrance of the shelter structure, wind, rain or snow can blow directly on the dogs. This does not
provide the animals proper protection from the elements. The Licensee must ensure that all outside shelter
structures have wind breaks and rain breaks at the entrance to provide the animals with proper protections from the
wind, rain and snow.Correct By: 9/30/2019

FEEDING.
The facility is currently using self feeders with open tops to feed the dogs housed in the outside enclosures. There
are a total of 4 self feeders that are placed out in the open without any protection from the rain or snow. There are a
total of 8 dogs that are housed in these enclosures and using the self feeders. The current location of these self
feeders will not minimize contamination and will allow the food to be affected by the elements. All self feeders must
be located in an area within the enclosure that is easily accessible to the dogs, but also located in an area where
they are protected from the rain and snow.
