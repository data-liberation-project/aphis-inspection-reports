3.28(b)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
At the time of inspection, one of the enclosures housing guinea pigs measuring 12x15 inches=360 inches square had 5
guinea pigs in it. The guinea pigs in the enclosure weighed 440 grams to 550 grams and required 90 inches per guinea
pig, so the maximum number of animals of that size was 4 (=360/90). Housing guinea pigs in enclosures without
sufficient space can have detrimental effects on their health and welfare.

Corrected during inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with an employee.
