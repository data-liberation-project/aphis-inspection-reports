Housing facilities, general.
The enclosure for the marmosets had an excessive buildup of debris observed on the enclosure bars as well as the
perching and resting surfaces. There was also areas of rust and pitting of the enclosure bars. This condition can harbor
disease causing pathogens and can be hazardous to the health of the animals. In addition, this condition can compromise
the strength of the enclosure. Hard surfaces with which non human primates come in contact must be cleaned and
sanitized in order to prevent excessive accumulation of excreta.

Sanitation.
1. A tree was observed leaning on the fencing of the sheep enclosure. This was causing the enclosure fencing to sag
downward. Enclosures need to be maintained in good repair.
2. There was section of enclosure fencing between the llama pen and the cow enclosure which was broken with jagged
wires. In addition, a pile of fencing wire and metal debris was observed in the llama pen, as well as an electrical wire and
an outlet coming out of the ground. This could lead to the llamas getting a limb entrapped or potentially getting injured. All
enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of clutter and debris.
3. The indoor enclosure housing porcupines had a buildup of dirt and debris. Enclosures and receptacles must be cleaned
as often as necessary in order to prevent excessive buildup of debris.
