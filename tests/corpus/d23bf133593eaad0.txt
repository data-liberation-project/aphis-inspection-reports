ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***The facility did not use appropriate means to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries of two
chinchillas with medical issues.
An 18 month old male chinchilla, with no ear ID in cage 24 housed with 2 other chinchillas, was squinting his left
eye. There was a clear dried discharge/substance around the left eye. Additionally, under the chin, there was a
hairless area that was approximately 1 centimeter in diameter. The visible skin was pink/red in color.
Cage 45 had a large amount of hair debris in it. When examining the three chinchilla’s house therein, one chinchilla
appeared to be quiet in demeanor and unthrifty while sitting on top of its plastic shelter. That 18 month old, male,
chinchilla, with no ear ID, had a large area of hairloss on his back. The hairless area, approximately 12 cm in length
and 2-3 cm in width, was along his entire back. The skin beneath the outer edges of the hairless area was pink.
Towards the middle of the hairless area, the skin was dark red in color and inflamed. In the center of the red skin,
the skin was dry and scabs had formed. The right ear had damage to the tip and two puncture wounds in the center
of the ear. There was dry blood around the base of the left ear, right ear, and at the base of the nose. This chinchilla
was immediately placed in a separate cage and the attending veterinarian was called.
The facility received these chinchillas 5 days ago. They were transported individually, and upon arrival they were
group housed three to a cage by the facility. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible
and should not be housed with other animals that interfere with their health or cause them discomfort. Facility staff
informed the VMO that these animals’ conditions had not been noticed by facility staff. The facility was unable to
provide any records indicating that these particular conditions had been treated medically by the facility.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Injuries and diseases that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be painful and can lead
to prolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care health problems. The facility must use appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. After the inspection, the facility provided veterinary care for both chinchillas, addressing the issues cited above.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
