ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***I arrived at the facility at 10:30 am and the gate was closed. I called the owner and the number was
disconnected. I honked the horn several times and no one answered. I left the facility at 11:00 am. A responsible
adult was not available and should have been made available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection
process at 10:30 am on 02/13/2014.
