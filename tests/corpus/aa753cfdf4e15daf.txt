2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At time of inspection, the facility did not have documentation of meeting the requirement for a regularly scheduled
visit to the premises by the attending veterinarian. Their written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) signed by the
attending veterinarian in 2011 requires an annual visit by the veterinarian. The last annual visit by the veterinarian
was documented in July, 2014, and the attending veterinarian has never visited the current site. The formal
arrangement with an attending or consulting veterinarian shall include regularly scheduled visits to the premises, at
least once per year, in addition to the written program of veterinary care.
Failure to complete a veterinary visit, at least annually, could jeopardize the welfare of the animals, since it provides
an opportunity for the exhibitor and the veterinarian to discuss husbandry and preventive care issues.
To be corrected by 12/8/15.
This inspection occurred at the Mission Arts Center site.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative, and Animal Care Veterinary Medical Officers Dr.
