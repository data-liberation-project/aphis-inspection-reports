3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
An enclosure housing three guinea pigs has excessive rusting along the wire cage sides, broken wires, and holes along
the bottom edges where an extremity or head could push through. The enclosure is comprised of a solid metal base with
a metal wire top and sides which sits into the base. The wire in three of the four corners has rusted through, causing
pieces of metal to break off and expose gaps between the flooring and the walls of approximately 1” in height and 2-3” in
width. While examining the enclosure gaps, a small piece of metal broke off. Areas of the remaining metal have created
sharp points that are accessible to the animals. The enclosure also has a wire panel in the center for separating males
and females. A section of the dividing panel in the back was also rusted through at the bottom, causing the panel to be
two sections shorter for approximately 4-5” in length. During inspection, a guinea pig was observed sticking its head under
the divider in an attempt to move to the other side.
Enclosures that have structural instability leading to gaps and sharp points can cause injury and potential entrapment or
escape of the animals housed within.
Correct by 7 April 2022 by ensuring all primary enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect
the guinea pigs from injury.

Watering.
Two water bottles in the guinea pig enclosure have green algae growing at the top rim. Contaminated water can lead to
decreased consumption by animals and subsequent dehydration and medical conditions. Correct by 7 April 2022 by
ensuring watering receptacles are sanitized when dirty and at least once every 2 weeks.
3.31(b)

Sanitation.
The back storage room of the facility has clutter and an accumulation of spider webs and other debris, impeding the ability
to adequately monitor the effectiveness of the pest control program and clean effectively. There are numerous
enclosures, some on shelving while others are sitting on the floor. Several of the enclosures were visibly dirty and had
evidence of fecal matter still on furniture within the enclosure. The room has stacks of supplies, enclosures, boxes, etc.
sitting in front of shelving units preventing effective cleaning and monitoring for pests around the baseboards and corners
of the room. The exposed floor had some spilled bedding, feed, and other debris. In the back corner there are numerous
cobwebs and cockroach droppings along with some dead cockroaches and a bait box. Additionally, several areas of the
facility have damaged drywall along the floors which allows an avenue for pests to enter the premises.
Unsanitary conditions, areas of disrepair, and clutter in buildings and grounds which house animals can lead to
unpleasant odors, attract pests and negatively impact animal welfare.
Correct by 14 April 2022 by ensuring premises where housing facilities are located, are kept clean and in good repair in
order to facilitate husbandry practices and to protect the animals from disease as well as injury.
3.31(c)

Sanitation.
During inspection, several large cockroaches were seen walking around on the floor in areas where animals are housed.
One smaller cockroach was also seen sitting on the back corner of the ferret enclosure. Cockroaches and other pests can


cause or transmit diseases and illness between animals and species. Correct by 14 April 2022 by establishing and
maintaining an effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
