3.31(a)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs are not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove accumulations of
dust, dirt, cobwebs, soiled bedding, and debris. All of the enclosures have accumulations of excreta, dirt and
debris; there is not a single enclosure that is adequately cleaned. The wooden frames and wire on the outside of the
primary enclosures are thickly covered with cobwebs, dust, and feed. The accumulations on the outsides of the
primary enclosures, especially on the bottom rows, were such that it was difficult to see into the enclosures to
observe the animals. The cleaning process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this
accumulation both inside and outside the enclosures. The owner's son stated he cleans the enclosures every 10
days by removing soiled bedding and putting new bedding in, but he does not sanitize and could not say the last
time sanitation was done. He stated that some of the enclosures were cleaned last week, and some had been left
for 2-3 weeks uncleaned. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards and health
problems. One guinea pig was heard sneezing, and the air quality within the facility was poor enough to cause
discomfort to the APHIS inspectors during the inspection, despite having air moving through via open doors and
windows and the use of fans. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of dust,
dirt, excreta, cobwebs, and debris and enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by
ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of
excreta, dirt and debris.
Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
Owner's son, who is primarily responsible for the care and cleaning of the guinea pigs and enclosures, stated he
cleans the primary enclosures about every 10 days, although sanitation is not performed. He was unsure of the last
time the enclosures were sanitized. Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or as
necessary with proper agents to sufficiently disinfect all surfaces that the guinea pigs may come into contact.
Sanitation of primary enclosures is necessary to minimize risk of disease to the animals housed therein.

SANITATION.
Housekeeping. The floor contains accumulations of spilled feed, straw, and debris. There are accumulations of dust,
dirt, cobwebs, and debris on the ceiling, walls, racks, and in empty and occupied enclosures. Enclosures used as
storage for unused water bottles and supplies were covered in multiple layers of accumulated filth. Dust and
cobwebs were so thickly covering the majority of surfaces on the inside of the facility that inspectors needed to
brush off clothing after completing the inspection. Animal facilities must be kept clean to ensure good quality of air
for the animals and to prevent unnecessary disease risks. Ineffective cleaning exposes the animals to disease
hazards and health problems. Correct by ensuring the premises are kept clean, including: removing accumulations
of dust, cobwebs, straw, shavings, and feed; routinely dusting off and sanitizing all surfaces on the inside of the
facility; cleaning out supplies stored in empty enclosures; and maintaining a level of general cleanliness to support
good animal husbandry and health.
Remains uncorrected.
3.32
EMPLOYEES.
The facility does not appear to have a sufficient number of employees to adequately care for the number of guinea
pigs being housed and to upkeep the general conditions in the facility. This facility has been cited repeatedly for
inadequate cleaning, housekeeping, and sanitation. Owner's son stated he is primarily responsible for the cleaning
and upkeep, and he works away three days each week. He tries to spend ~2 hours each day inside the guinea pig
facility. Insufficient employees allows cleaning and housekeeping to fall behind, and these conditions can pose
health risks to the animals. There must be a sufficient number of employees who can adequately care for the guinea
pigs and maintain a level of cleanliness in the facility that is appropriate for good animal health and husbandry.

Exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
