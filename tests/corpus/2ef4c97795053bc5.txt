3.133 Critical

Separation.
The facility had a ram in an enclosure with two alpaca that were incompatible. An alpaca that had been previously isolated
and treated for neurological symptoms related to thiamine deficiency was later determined to have an injury to the neck by
the attending veterinarian. It was further deduced by the licensee that the ram injured the neck of the isolated alpaca
resulting in a cervical vertebral injury. The animal was later euthanized after a definitive diagnosis was confirmed by the
attending veterinarian. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible to prevent injury and
discomfort. The facility has since attempted to correct this by removing and selling the ram.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
