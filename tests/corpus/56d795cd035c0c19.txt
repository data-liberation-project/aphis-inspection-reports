INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Section 2.31(d)(1)(iii) IACUC: Most of the facility animal use protocols (animal activity proposals) reviewed during
this inspection do not have written assurance from the facility instructor (principal investigator) that the activities do
not unnecessarily duplicate previous work. Examples include the following protocols: VET 115-01, VET 121-01,
VET 215-67, VET 217-01, VET 217-68, VET 221-67, and VET 222-01. To comply with the Animal Welfare
regulations and to help prevent unnecessary animal usage, all animal use protocols must contain written assurance
by the instructor/principal investigator that the activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous work. Correct by
ensuring all IACUC approved animal use protocols comply with the above requirement. Correct by August 31,
2016.
2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Section 2.31(e)(2) IACUC: Several of the facility animal use protocols (animal activity proposals) reviewed during
this inspection base the number of animals used on the number of students per animal. There is no explanation or
rationale for how the ratio was determined. Examples include the following protocols: VET 121-01, VET 217-68,
VET 221-67, and VET 222-01. To comply with the Animal Welfare regulations and to help ensure appropriate
numbers of animals are used, all animal use protocols must contain a rationale for the appropriateness of the
number of animals to be used. Correct by ensuring all IACUC approved animal activities comply with the above
requirement. Correct by August 31, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility program coordinator.
