2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The program of veterinarian care ( USDA form 7002 ) had nothing listed under the vaccinations, parasites
control, emergency care and euthanasia sections. Program of vet care provides a source of information that tells
what vaccinations will be given, de worming programs, parasite control programs or methods used to euthanize all
dogs on the premise and who the vet of record for the licensee will be. When the program of vet care is not
completely filled out on how the licensee provides for the health and well-being of all dogs on the premise, it is not
considered to be adequate veterinary care. USDA regulations require a written program of veterinary care for
facilities which do not employ a full-time veterinarian. That program of veterinary care must be made available for
review during inspections to ensure adequate veterinary care is being provided. The licensee must follow a written
program of veterinary care as directed by the attending veterinarian.

The following dogs are in need of Veterinarian Care:
* The entire left eye of an adult female silver and white Shih zue ( tag number 061 ) is red in color. Eye disease
can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions.
The attending veterinarian had not been consulted nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection.
The licensee stated that this was the first time the eye had been noticed Eye problems can be painful causing
discomfort which affects the health and well- being of the dog.
* There is a moist looking, reddish in appearance ¼(cid:29) to ½(cid:29) prolapsed growth of tissue protruding from the lower
right eyelid of a red female cocker ( No identification ). This could be caused by an infection, irritation, swelling,
inflammation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted
nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection. The licensee stated that this was the first time the
eye had been noticed Eye problems can be painful causing discomfort which affects the health and well- being of
the dog.
* One fawn and white adult female Shih zue ( tag number 104 ) was observed holding its left rear leg up and
placing no weight on the foot over a two to three minute period. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted
nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection. The licensee stated that this was the first time theeye had been noticed Foot problems can be painful causing discomfort when the dog places weight on the
affected foot. It can affect the mobility and daily activity of this dog.
The licensee must have these three animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* There are 10 dogs that did not have official identification on them at time of facility inspection. The licensee is
using collars as the official identification. Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal(cid:25)s identity can
be known with certainty and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are officially
identified by collar, tattoo or microchip means. If the licensee uses microchips then a microchip reader must be
made available to the inspector at time of facility inspection. The licensee must ensure that all dogs on the premise
have official identification on them at all times. Correct by 4/12/15.
2.75(a)(1)(6)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* USDA APHIS 7005 form ( Record of Dogs on Hand ) has incomplete information on 38 dogs housed at the
premise. No official identification was listed on these dogs at time of inspection. Complete and accurate records
are needed to ensure each animal(cid:25)s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace dogs.
The licensee must maintain records which fully disclose all information concerning each dog in their possession.
Correct by 4/12/15.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* One fiberglass wallboard has an estimated six inch tear in it. The affected surface is located in the whelp
building housing two dogs. Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
The open area between the fiberglass and wood wall could serve as a collection area for dirt, hair, fecal waste or
other debris. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis so those surfaces can
be readily cleaned and sanitized at all times or be replaced when worn.. Correct by 3/26/15.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on the fiberglass wall board in at least five
enclosures. Ten dogs are in contact with the affected wall boards located in sheltered housing. The affected areacovers approximately 20 to 30 percent of the fiberglass wall board. The licensee stated the wall board surfaces
were last cleaned and sanitized about a month ago. Cleaning and sanitization of surfaces in contact with the dogs
are necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. Unsanitary living conditions and
potential transmission of diseases exists when surfaces are not cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure
that all surfaces are spot cleaned on a daily basis and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to
prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. Correct by 3/17/15.
3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
* The program of exercise for 150 dogs was blank and not signed by the attending veterinarian at time of facility
inspection. The program of exercise must be developed in accordance with the attending veterinarian
recommendations to ensure the dogs are receiving adequate exercise. The licensee must develop, document and
follow an appropriate plan of exercise and the plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian. Correct by
4/12/15.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* An accumulation of hair, cobwebs and dust is collecting on an estimated 15 to 25 percent of the chain link
fencing located on top of five interior enclosures. In addition, an accumulation of hair, cobwebs and dust was
covering an estimated 20 to 30 percent of the bottom edge of at least 15 interior enclosure gates. Twenty two dogs
are in contact with the affected areas located on the interior of sheltered housing. The accumulation of hair,
cobwebs and dust create an unsanitary living condition that could impact the health and well-being of the dogs. It
indicates a potential living area for other pests that are housed with the dogs. The licensee must remove all hair,
cobwebs and dust from the affected areas so these surfaces can be cleaned and sanitized to satisfy generally
accepted husbandry standards and practices.
* The facility inspection done on 3/12/15 and exit briefing conducted on 3/16/15 were conducted with the licensee.
