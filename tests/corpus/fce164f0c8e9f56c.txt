2.38(f)(1) Critical Repeat

Miscellaneous.
An incident of incorrect use of a transport box with a non-human primate (NHP) on 4/30/22 allowed it to get loose in the
room and seriously injure the tongue of another NHP. Incorrect handling can allow animals to get injured. Ensure that
animals are handled as carefully as possible in a manner that protects their health and wellbeing.

Note: The facility identified this incident and reported it to the ACUC and OLAW. The affected animals in the incident were
appropriately evaluated and treated by veterinary staff.
3.80(a)(2)(iii) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On 6/15/22, two NHPs were found to have gotten out of their enclosure likely due to being able to force an enclosure door
open. While they were out in the room, injury was caused to the tongue of another NHP that required sutures and
veterinary care. The two NHPs that got out had minor injuries and were returned to their enclosure and the door was
secured better. Enclosures that allow NHPs to get out can allow injury to NHPs within the same room. Ensure that
enclosures contain the animals securely.



Note: The facility identified this incident and reported it to the ACUC. The affected animals in the incident were
appropriately evaluated and treated by veterinary staff.
Correction: Ensure corrective actions are maintained and followed.
