2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility does not have a recorded site visit by the attending veterinarian. Good communication and consultation
between the licensee and the attending veterinarian in the form of a written program of veterinary care and regularly
scheduled visits to the premise are necessary for the health of the animals. The licensee must schedule a site visit
with the attending veterinarian.
The written program of veterinary care does not have information pertaining to the ferrets present at the facility.
Failure to have a complete written program of veterinary care does not ensure that the animals are receiving
veterinary care consistent with currently accepted veterinary practices. It shall include product dosage, route of
administration, concentration of active ingredient, the frequency of use, testing to be completed and the frequency in
which testing shall be done. The program of veterinary care must be updated to ensure that all animals are provided
adequate veterinary care at all times.
No regulated activity can be conducted from this site until it has been approved.
Exit interview conducted with licensee.
