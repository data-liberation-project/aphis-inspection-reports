PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
At the time of inspection, a ferret was undergoing a survival procedure involving an open craniotomy chamber
exposing the brain cavity (major operative procedure). The procedure involved placing study devices inside the
chamber. The placement of the sterile field for instruments and supplies was in a location where it could be easily
contaminated, unobserved by the person doing the procedure. During the observation, the sterile field was on an
instrument table in a corner of the very small room outfitted as an acoustic chamber. As the person manipulated the
electrode and fiber optic cables, the sterile field was at times behind him, allowing his lab coat to breach sterility of
the field.
Aseptic technique requires that sterile fields be maintained the entire time a body cavity is open. Failure to do so
may result in infection, harming the animal and interfering with the research.
From this point forward, ensure that all sterile fields remain sterile for the duration of any procedure involving an
open body cavity.
2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
An incident occurred recently when an employee needed to leave before completing care for one room of prairie
voles. Another employee completed the work in that room for the day. The next day, four animals in that room were
found dead and another was moribund and euthanized. The facility determined that cage change and water bottle
replacement for a section of the animal area was missed during the change of employees. Due to the lack of that
day’s observation for these animals, their water ran out, resulting in dehydration and death.
All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and any needs they may have.
Corrected prior to the time of inspection by revising the communication and transition procedure for a staff change
during the workday.
2.36(b)(3)
ANNUAL REPORT.The IACUC approved exceptions to the requirement for a dedicated surgery area for non-rodent animals for
protocols IP01561 and IP00211. These exceptions were not reported on the 2019 annual report.
All granted exceptions not specifically allowed in the regulations must be reported on the annual report.
Correct within 30 days by submitting an amended report to USDA.
This inspection was conducted on January 21-23, 2020 with facility personnel, and the exit interview was conducted
with the IACUC Director on January 23, 2020.
