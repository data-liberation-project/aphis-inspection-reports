ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:20am on
20-Nov-17.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 11:20 am and knocked on the door twice, there was no answer. I then
contacted the licensee by phone and was informed they would not be home til much later in the evening. We
discussed Optimal Hours for inspection.
