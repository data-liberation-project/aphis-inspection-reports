ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were six rabbits during today(cid:25)'s inspection that were identified as needing veterinary care.
A male gray/tan Lop rabbit identified as "(cid:28)MacKintosh(cid:29)" was observed lying with eyes closed in front of his cage by
inspectors. The animal appeared dull and limp and was unresponsive to touch. With repeated attempts to rouse, the
animal eventually responded but was hunched and eyes partially closed and squinting. The licensee agreed that
the animal did not look well but failed to observe the animal required veterinary attention. Inspectors requested the
licensee send the rabbit to the veterinarian immediately for urgent care. The rabbit was taken to the urgent care
facility while inspectors were still on the premises.
A black female "Fuzzy" Lop rabbit identified as (cid:28)"Charcoal"(cid:29), identified on the previous inspection on 3/20/15 as
sneezing and having greenish yellow discharge coming primarily from the left nostril was found today with the same
or worse symptoms of illness. The left nostril now has a dark brown and black crust like material covering the left
nostril. The inspectors requested veterinary documentation for "Charcoal" but the licensee was not able to produce
it.
(cid:28)"Copper", a male copper and gray French Angora rabbit identified on the previous inspection on 3/20/15, had red,
dry, dark, scaly debris that filled the entire inner portion of his left ear such that the ear canal was entirely obscured
by this material. On this inspection, the ear was improved from the previous inspection, but still had one third of the
ear affected by reddish brown debris. Upon reviewing medication with the licensee, it was discovered that the
veterinarian had prescribed Baytril (Enrofloxacin) at 0.7 ml twice each day. There were two vials of Baytril on site-
one with a volume capacity of 30mls and one with a volume capacity of 8 mls. According to the directions of the
veterinarian, on this inspection date, there should have been only 2 mls remaining of the prescribed medication;
however, there were 28 mls of liquid Baytril remaining. The licensee failed to follow the advice and directions of the
veterinarian. Had the licensee done so, it(cid:25)s probable that "Copper(cid:25)'s" ear infection would have resolved.
(cid:28)"Honeycomb(cid:29)", a female tan and gray (cid:28)Lop(cid:29) rabbit was observed sneezing by an inspector. An opaque thick
discharge was observed coming from one nostril when she sneezed. "Honeycomb" is presently being housed with
her 6-8 week old litter putting the offspring at risk of respiratory disease. "Honeycomb" requires immediateveterinary care to evaluate her condition.
(cid:28)"Sylvi"(cid:29), a female juvenile silver Champagne D(cid:25)Argent rabbit was observed sneezing and had wetness underneath
both nostrils.
An unnamed juvenile lilac tort Lionhead juvenile rabbit was observed sneezing numerous times by the inspector and
had wetness underneath both nostrils.
(cid:28)"Honeybear(cid:29)", a female tan Lop rabbit was taken to the veterinarian and diagnosed with an abscess/open wound of
the right ear on 3/31/15. She was Prescribed Baytril (Enrofloxacin) at 0.6 ml twice each day and the licensee was
given 8 mls. An additional 30 ml bottle of Baytril was then prescribed at a rate of 0.46 ml twice each day. On 4/13/15
the veterinarian stated that Baytril was to be given for one month more or longer if small abscesses continue to
erupt. There were two vials of Baytril on site- one with a volume capacity of 30 mls and one with a volume capacity
of 8 mls. According to the directions of the veterinarian, on this inspection date, there should have been only 7 mls
remaining of the prescribed medication; however, there were 27 mls of liquid Baytril remaining. Additionally, on a
follow up visit to the veterinarian, the licensee was prescribed Sulfadiazine cream that was to be applied to the
affected ear twice each day. However, none had been used and the jar was completely full. The licensee stated that
the ear was better so it wasn'(cid:25)t necessary. The licensee is required to follow the advice and direction of the
veterinarian, but she failed to do so.
Signs of eye, ear, skin and respiratory illness or other medical conditions such as depression or unresponsiveness
are indicative of severe health issues. Failure to provide veterinary care and treatment in a timely manner can result
in discomfort, pain, disability or death. The licensee must ensure that appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries are provided in a timely manner, and must provide documentation of
these veterinary evaluations and treatments (if prescribed) to the inspectors upon request.
The licensee was verbally instructed to have "Mackintosh" seen by a veterinarian on 4/27/15, the date of inspection.
"Charcoal" was instructed to be seen by the veterinarian the day after the 3/20/15 inspection. The Licensee was
verbally instructed to have "Siri", the Lionhead and "Honeycomb" examined by the veterinarian by 4/30/15.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 6 animals identified on this inspection that were in need of veterinary care. The licensee had not
observed the signs of illness or abnormality in these animals and had not contacted the veterinarian to address
these issues. Untreated health concerns can be detrimental to the animals(cid:25) health and well-being. The licensee
must observe all animals daily to assess their health status. The licensee must also establish a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems ofanimal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed in an accurate and timely manner.
2.75(b)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has a method of documenting acquisitions and dispositions. However, the record of acquisition is
confusing and incomplete for the juveniles. The juveniles have been assigned a number that the licensee cannot
explain and the number cannot be tied to any individual animal. There are 39 juveniles listed on the inventory.
During the inspection, 25 juveniles were counted. 16 juveniles were on the disposition forms. According to the
licensee, 4 juveniles had been incorporated into the adult population and 2 juvenile animals were loose outside their
enclosures. This leaves 8 juveniles not listed on the acquisition form. Additionally, species information is not listed
for 18 juveniles and the sex of the juveniles is missing for 38 of the animals listed. Acquisition dates are missing for
19 juveniles. Species information is missing for 8 of the 11 bucks. There are 2 female adult rabbits that were not
found on the acquisition forms; a rabbit identified as "Nancy" and a white/tan Holland Lop. "Raven's" 8 new offspring
are not listed on the acquisition form. Some dispositions of animals were missing the name and address of the
individual who obtained the animals.
Accurate record keeping is essential to allow APHIS to accurately track animals and ensure that all animals are
receiving proper care as required by the Animal Welfare Act. Additionally, specific information regarding sources for
acquisition and disposition are necessary in the event of disease to facilitate tracking animal movement and to
ensure animal health and welfare. The licensee must make, keep and maintain records which fully disclose
information regarding all acquisitions and dispositions; including all births, deaths, animals euthanized as well as all
other information required by this subsection.
3.50(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were an estimated 5 wooden enclosures, raised platform fixtures and wood framing supports that were found
to be in disrepair. There were an estimated 12 walls, fixtures and support structures that were saturated with urine
and feces, as well as evidence of deterioration of the wood. These unmaintained and damaged structures cannot be
properly sanitized and can harbor disease causing organisms. Additionally, the large enclosure containing 7 juvenile
rabbits was sagging in the middle. The enclosure is currently held up by two (cid:24)sawhorses(cid:25) on each end, but there is
no structural support in the middle nor are the sawhorses secured in any manner. The enclosure is easily moved
and is unstable. The enclosure is not structurally sound and poses a risk of injuring the animals contained therein.
The enclosure needs to be structurally sound and in good repair to ensure the safety of the animals and protect the
animals from injury.3.52(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There were two rows with 8 enclosures housing rabbits and 5 juveniles that had no protection from the wind, rain or
snow. These enclosures had a structure overtop of the enclosure to protect the animals from the direct rays of the
sun. The shelter holding the 8 enclosures has only one plastic drape on the left side acting as a wind, rain or snow
break. The other 3 sides of the shelter has no protection from adverse weather conditions. The licensee must
ensure that these animals are adequately protected from the adverse or extreme weather conditions on all sides of
their enclosures as suggested by the attending veterinarian. These animals must have adequate shelter to protect
them from the wind, rain, snow and other inclement weather.
3.52(d) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The fencing for the outdoor enclosures is down on the back and front part of the facility. The licensee stated that
the fencing had to be temporarily taken down in order to fix some of the enclosures and organize sections of the
facility. The licensee also stated that, there is no reason to put the fence back up if work is still being conducted.
During the inspection, inspectors identified three rabbits outside of their primary enclosure, running loose on the
property.
The outdoor housing facility needs to have a fence in order to protect the rabbits from escaping and predation.
Rabbits housed outdoors are vulnerable to attacks by predators; therefore outdoor housing facilities for rabbits are
required to be fenced, or otherwise enclosed, to prevent the entrance of predators. Failure to maintain this fencing
in a manner that excludes predators can lead to severe injury and / or the death of animals. The licensee must
ensure that the rabbit enclosures are fenced or are otherwise enclosed to minimize escape, to prevent entrance of
predators and that the gates to such fencing are kept closed so that the fencing remains functional.
3.53(a)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The inspectors observed 3 uncontained rabbits running loose on the property. The licensee identified the rabbits as
belonging to her; however the licensee could not identify the rabbits by name. An employee of the facility stated
that escaped rabbits usually run along a trail outside the facility and go to the blackberry bushes to eat. One rabbit
was captured and a trap was set by the licensee to capture the remaining 2 rabbits. This facility takes rabbits to
birthday parties and has rabbits that are tamed for frequent handling. Domestic, caged rabbits are not normally
exposed to predators or other conditions of life in the wild. While uncontained, these prey animals are more likely to
be injured or harmed. The licensee must ensure that there are measures in place to readily identify that an animal is
missing in the event of an escape. Licensee must ensure all enclosures are constructed in a manner that will
adequately contain the animal to prevent escape.There are several enclosures that are not structurally sound to protect the animals from injury. The enclosures
provided for the rabbits, including the flooring, are constructed of wire mesh. There is no additional source of
support for the larger rabbits, allowing the flooring to sag significantly making the enclosures unstable under the
weight of the animals. The lack of structurally sound enclosures is creating steep sloping of the floor such that it
prevents the rabbits from moving freely about their enclosure. Failure to provide enclosures that are structurally
sound may lead to injury, ligament and muscle damage of these animals. The licensee must ensure that the
enclosures are structurally sound so that the floors of the primary enclosures are not sagging. Additionally, the
primary enclosures need to be maintained in good repair to prevent injury to the animals.
3.53(a)(5)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
This facility currently does not use properly constructed nesting boxes for females with litters less than a month old.
A near term pregnant female white New Zealand rabbit named "(cid:28)Mooni"(cid:29) was observed by the inspectors building a
nest inside the enclosure with no nesting box. Nesting boxes are necessary in order to have a safe place to give
birth for the doe and to nurse her babies. It is also important to allow for the motor coordination and the
heat-regulation capacity of the baby rabbits to develop. A nesting box needs to be provided to all females with a
litter of less than a month old to ensure comfort and safety of the animals.

3.54(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
At least 10 rabbits had no food inside their food receptacle. When these animals were offered food by the licensee
at the request of the inspectors they began eating voraciously. Inadequate amounts of food can cause malnutrition,
illness or death. Adequate food appropriate for the age, species and number of animals must be provided to the
animals at least once daily.
3.54(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
Inside the enclosure containing (cid:28)"Dosty(cid:29)", an adult female grey chinchilla and (cid:28)"Harvey Dent",(cid:29) a male brown/tan
Angora rabbit, the self-feeding receptacle had old caked rabbit food at the bottom. The inspector observed the
licensee putting fresh food inside the receptacle without removing the old feed and cleaning the receptacle. This is
important to ensure that fresh, palatable, nutritious food is provided to the rabbits. Measures must be taken to
prevent the molding, deterioration or caking of the feed to prevent the contamination of the fresh feed.
The enclosure containing (cid:28)"Ginger Mags",(cid:29) a male tan European rabbit, had a large amount of feces inside the foodreceptacle. Inadequate cleaning and sanitizing of receptacles can lead to contamination and potential for diseases.
Food receptacles shall be located so as to minimize contamination by excreta.
All food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Contaminated food receptacles
directly expose the animals to harmful bacteria that affect the health and wellbeing of the animals. Licensee must
ensure that all food receptacles are cleaned and sanitized to minimize disease hazards.
3.55 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
The juvenile rabbits in the large, small, and sheltered juvenile enclosures consisting of 28 juveniles and one adult
named "(cid:28)Honey Comb(cid:29)" a female tan/grey Lop, contain watering receptacles that are empty. After requesting the
licensee give the rabbits water, the inspectors observed the rabbits drinking profusely and consistently for 15
minutes which was video recorded by the inspectors. The rabbits were very anxious and standing on their hind legs
as the licensee put the full water bottles on cages. Some of the rabbits appeared frantic and were observed
pushing other rabbits out of the way to get to the water source. There were approximately 20 other rabbits that
were lacking water bottles or a water source in their enclosures throughout the facility including a doe (cid:28)"Raven"(cid:29) with
8 nursing offspring. Lack of drinking water can cause discomfort and dehydration which can cause distress and
disorientation. Lack of sufficient water can cause health conditions that can be injurious or life threatening. The
licensee must ensure that all rabbits have a sufficient amount of potable water daily.
The licensee was verbally instructed to provide water to the animals immediately.
3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
All the hard surfaces of the (cid:28)old(cid:29) enclosures have an excessive amount of dirt, urine, feces, hair, cobwebs and other
organic material build up. There is an excessive amount of white splatter on at least 4 enclosures. The material was
found on the wooden frames on the sides and outside of the enclosures. The licensee stated that it is urine from
the bucks when they spray to mark their territory.
The enclosure containing the adult male ginger/white mini lop rabbit (cid:28)"Ginger Mags(cid:29)" had an excessive amount of
feces and urine built up around the food receptacle. Unsanitary conditions can harbor pests and disease causing
organisms and can be detrimental to the health of the animals.
The licensee must ensure that there are adequate measures in place to remove all dust, dirt, urine, feces and all
other organic material from all surfaces of the facility by providing periodic cleaning of the enclosures and hardsurfaces.
3.56(a)(3) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The worm bins/pans or troughs underneath one of the outdoor shelters, comprising 8 enclosures is overflowing with
hay and feces. When wire cage floors are equipped with bins, pans, worm bins or troughs to collect waste, the bins
or pan must be kept in a sanitary condition to prevent disease hazards, vermin and insect infestation which may
lead to an unhealthy living environment for the rabbits.
3.56(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
This facility has an excessive amount of clutter lying within and around the facility perimeter. The materials consist
of unused wire cages, plastic materials, wood, trash, and wire mesh. There is no organization of these materials
and the majority is being kept in unsanitary conditions and potentially contributing to disease hazards within the
facility. Excessive clutter creates an ideal breeding ground for mammalian and insect pests and creates numerous
hiding areas that may conceal predators. The licensee must ensure that that all unwanted items are properly
discarded and removed from the property. Additionally, useful items must be properly cleaned, organized and
stored so that all areas of the premise, including the garage and storage areas are kept clean, in good repair and
free of the accumulation of trash in order to facilitate proper husbandry practices.
3.57 DIRECT REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The licensee does not have enough properly trained employees to adequately feed, water, clean and care for the
rabbits. The licensee stated that she has hired 2 individuals to come in (cid:28)a couple of times a week(cid:29). Following the
last inspection, the licensee stated that she had hired an individual to care for the animals. However, this individual
is currently occupied with building a structure. He stated he strictly works as a maintenance worker and has no
formal training in animal care and husbandry and welfare of the animals. The licensee agreed that this individual
has no formal training. The licensee stated that she still uses a temporary service to help with animal husbandry and
that these individuals have no formal training. The other employees are used for parties using the rabbits, but are
not directly involved with daily care. Another employee stated that she helps out at times. The licensee must ensure
that she has an appropriate amount of animals that she can adequately care for or hire and train an adequate
amount of employees to provide appropriate care for the rabbits to ensure their health and welfare, and to
adequately maintain the facility.
3.61(a)(4) REPEATPRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE RABBITS.
During the inspection, the employees put 5 rabbits inside individual plastic (24(cid:29)x18(cid:29)x15(cid:29)) rectangular containers that
had small holes drilled into the lids that are less than half centimeter in diameter for ventilation. The ventilation
openings for the rabbits on these enclosures are inadequate and can restrict necessary airflow to the animals,
which could result in overheating or otherwise compromise health during transportation. The licensee stated to the
employees that the rabbits cannot be inside the enclosures with the lids on for more than a few minutes because
the rabbits can suffocate. The licensee stated that that once the enclosures are put in the transport vehicle the lids
are removed. However, inspectors observed rabbits trying to jump out, and on one occasion a rabbit got out of the
transport enclosure and was loose in the garage. All licensees are required to ensure that the transport enclosure
securely and safely contains the animals. Transport enclosures for rabbits must have ventilation openings located
on two opposite walls of the primary enclosure and the ventilation openings on each wall must be at least 16
percent of the total surface area. Alternately, transport enclosures for rabbits may have ventilation openings located
on all four walls of the primary enclosure provided that those openings are at least 8 percent of the total surface
area of each wall. As they are currently constructed, the Rubbermaid-type (cid:24)containers(cid:25) do not provide adequate
ventilation as required. Correct by ensuring that all transport enclosure used in the future are constructed in a
manner so that adequate ventilation is provided to all animals and that all other requirements for enclosure
construction and containment are met.
