Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available for review during this inspection. Approximately 202 adult guinea pigs,
weanlings, and newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records maintained for several
months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal
losses by decreased number of guinea pig born, raised, or died. The licensee must maintain records containing the
required information for animals which disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired or disposed of including
births and deaths. Correct by August 25, 2022.

Watering.
All the water bottles have a layer of dark, green algae covering the inside surfaces. Failure to provide potable water can
expose the guinea pigs to health risks. Water receptacles must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks to ensure water
is potable/drinkable. Licensee must ensure that water bottles are sanitized when dirty, and that bottles are sanitized at
least once every 2 weeks. Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.

Two enclosures housing a total of 20 adult guinea pigs and 14 newborns had moist fecal accumulations covering the
floor. Four enclosures housing a total of 21 adult guinea pigs and 14 newborns had accumulations of dry fecal material
covering the floor (gray pans). The cleaning process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this
accumulation inside enclosures. Lack of regular cleaning and sanitation exposes the guinea pigs to potential disease
hazards such as bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. These 6 enclosures were cleaned and fresh shavings were
provided during this inspection. Licensee must ensure that enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to
prevent an accumulation of excreta(feces), and soiled bedding. In addition, enclosures must be sanitized at least once
every 2 weeks. Correct by August 20, 2022.
