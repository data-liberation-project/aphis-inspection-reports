ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1330 on
02/18/2014.
I was able to make contact by phone and toldthe licensee that we could wait 1/2 hr after which we would need to
leave and I would send an attempted inspection via mail. Licensee stated he could not be there for at least an hour.
We then left the premises.
