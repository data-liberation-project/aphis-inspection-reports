2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
A search for unlicensed activity was conducted. The facility representative stated that sales of animals via
wholesale transaction were being conducted regularly. This is activity for which a USDA license is required.
Conducting regulated activity without a license does not allow the regulatory process, including routine inspections,
to ensure the welfare standards are being met for those animals. This is not in compliance with the Animal Welfare
Act. Correct by either applying for a USDA "A" license to conduct regulated sales via wholesale, or cease to
conduct these types of sales without a USDA license.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
