SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The indoor area of the sheltered facility for 4 newly acquired large breed dogs has a wooden floor and walls in
contact with the dogs. Although the area is clean on this inspection, exposed raw wood is not impervious to
moisture or able to be properly sanitized. The license stated he plans to make the floor and wall impervious but has
not had time to do so. Surfaces in contact with the dogs must be impervious to allow it to be properly sanitized.
Correct by ensuring all surfaces in contact with the dogs are impervious.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The indoor sheltered area for 4 large breed dogs has a section of coated metal wire used a barrier for the dogs.
During this inspection, the dogs stood on their hind feet and placed their front paws onto this barrier and were able
to bend over at least 1 foot of the top of the barrier. This coated metal wire is not structurally strong enough to
contain these large breed dogs and is a potential injury hazard to the dogs should they get a front foot caught in the
bent over metal. The licensee must replace or repair this area to ensure it properly contains the dogs and protects
them from injury.
