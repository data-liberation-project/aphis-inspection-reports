2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility has given a cattle nutritional supplement, Knock Out, to dog's with diarrhea without consulting with their
attending veterinarian on an effective treatment plan. The attending veterinarian was not aware of this treatment being
given to dog's with diarrhea. Diarrhea may be a symptom of a intestinal parasites and may cause unnecessary pain and
discomfort to the animals.
A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The facility must communicate with the
attending veterinarian on all treatment plans for medical ailments including but not limited to diarrhea.
To be corrected by: From this day forward.
2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is missing the Record of Disposition for Dogs (APHIS Form 7006) for four adult dogs sold on 2-July-2022.
Three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (#23, #24, #12) and one Poodle (#16) were sold to a facility in Missouri. The
transporter took the form to be signed by the buyer and never returned a copy to the facility. Disposition records of
animals sold must be accurate and kept up to date to allow APHIS officials to track the animals' movements.
Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the acquisition information

concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or
her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The facility must accurately
create and maintain all disposition records when each dog is transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of.
To be corrected by: From this day forward.
3.13(a)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility's Program of Veterinary Care is missing the frequency in which the attending veterinarian will conduct
regularly scheduled visits to the premises where dogs are kept. The facility is having the veterinarian come annually but
this is not in writing and approved by the attending veterinarian.
Regularly scheduled premises visits by the attending veterinarian at least every 12 months ensure the adequacy of
veterinary care and other aspects of animal care. The facility must develop a plan in writing with the attending veterinarian
how often they will visit the premises.
To be corrected by: 9-December-2022.
3.13(a)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility's Program of Veterinary Care is missing the frequency of which the veterinarian will conduct head to tail exams
on all dogs. Head to tail exams ensure the dogs with potential medical ailments are identified early by the attending
veterinarian to prevent potential pain and discomfort.
The written program of veterinary care must address the requirements for adequate veterinary care for every dealer and
exhibitor in § 2.40 of this subchapter and must include a complete physical examination from head to tail of each dog by
the attending veterinarian not less than once every 12 months. The facility must develop a plan in writing with the

attending veterinarian for the frequency of head to tail exams on all dogs, no less than every 12 months.
To be corrected by: 9-December-2022.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
At least 8 adult dogs are not up to date on distemper, parvovirus and rabies vaccines. The dogs listed below were either
in heat, pregnant or nursing when the other dogs were vaccinated on Rabies on 1-July-2022 and distemper/parvovirus on
10-June-2022. This caused them to need to be vaccinated once the puppies were weaned. The facility was aware these
dogs needed to be vaccinated but had not scheduled a veterinary visit for Rabies or vaccinated the dogs for
parvovirus/distemper.
Overdue for Distemper, Parvovirus, Rabies:
-Little Toot #18- puppies left the facility on 16-September-2022.
-Three Toot #19- puppies left the facility on 16-September-2022.
-Little Roxie #10- puppies left the facility on 2-October-2022.
-Amy #22- puppies left the facility on 16-September-2022.
Overdue for Distemper and Parvovirus
-Tootsie #20- puppies left the facility on 20-August-2022.
-Amber #11- puppies left the facility between 18-July-2022 and 20-August-2022.
Overdue for Rabies
-Bella #5- was in heat at the time the vaccines were given but never became pregnant.
-Izzy #4- was in heat at the time of vaccines given, puppies left the facility this week.
Dogs not kept up to date on vaccines may contract contagious and/or deadly diseases, which may cause unnecessary
pain and discomfort.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian. The facility must follow the schedule for Distemper, Parvovirus and Rabies vaccines
written in the Program of Veterinary Care to protect the dogs from these contagious and/or deadly diseases. The facility
must vaccinate all dogs in need of the vaccines listed above, keep a written vaccine record and maintain the vaccine
schedule in all dogs from this day forward.
To be corrected by: 9-December-2022.


The facility has not tested 10% of the kennel for intestinal parasites (intestinal worms, giardia, coccidia) as listed on their
Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to follow the parasite control program approved by the Attending Veterinarian may
not properly protect the dogs from parasites and may cause illness to go undetected and untreated, which may cause
pain and unnecessary discomfort to the dogs. The facility must follow the approved parasite control testing schedule
approved by the attending veterinarian to protect the dogs from parasites and other pests (worms, coccidia, giardia and
heartworm) and have 10% of the kennel tested annually.
To be corrected by: 9-December-2022.
3.13(b)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility had the head to tail exams done by the attending veterinarian on all dogs on 1-July-2022, but there is no
written medical record with the results/findings and identification of each dog examined during this routine exam.
The lack of medical records makes it difficult to determine if the animals are receiving the preventative medical
assessments and if any medical issues were identified. This information is needed for APHIS inspectors to ensure the
medical care is being provided by the facility. The facility must complete and maintain updated medical records including

the identity of the animal, including identifying marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s breed, sex, and age;
Provided, however, that routine husbandry, such as vaccinations, preventive medical procedures, or treatments,
performed on all animals in a group (or herd), may be kept on a single record. The facility must create and keep in writing
which dogs were examined by the veterinarian and any results or findings. If any medical issues were identified, a
treatment plan must be also created in writing and approved by the veterinarian.
