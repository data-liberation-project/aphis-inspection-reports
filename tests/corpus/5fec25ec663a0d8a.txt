2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On September 5, a primate at the facility identified as Cody was able to come in contact with a member of the public
and bite him. This happened when the animal owner had direct control of the animal. Without proper and adequate
handling of the animals, there is a risk of injury to both the public and the animals involved. Licensee must assure
there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the public to ensure safety to all involved.
