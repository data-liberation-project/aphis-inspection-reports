2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Pomeranian #128 was observed awkwardly sitting in the corner of her enclosure with one hind leg raised while
other animals were jumping and stepping on her. Upon further examination, there was a circular area of hair loss with
reddened skin on the backside of the left hind leg, and the skin on the top of her vulva was swollen and reddened as well.
When the inspectors asked the licensee to remove her from her enclosure and place her on the floor to prompt her to
move, she was very reluctant and only moved for a few steps before she sat down in the same awkward position and
began licking those areas. When the licensee was asked about this dog's disposition, he stated no issues have been
previously identified with her, but she was always "a sitter." He also identified previous animals of her lineage as having
similar issues, but did not communicate with the veterinarian about these previous issues. A lack of daily observation in
conjunction with the lack of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian prolongs pain and
discomfort by not allowing health problems to be addressed in a timely manner. Ensure daily observations of any
abnormal behaviors or issues have been identified and communicated with your attending veterinarian within a timely
manner. Corrected at the time of the exit interview. This animal has an appointment with the attending veterinarian
tomorrow morning.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
