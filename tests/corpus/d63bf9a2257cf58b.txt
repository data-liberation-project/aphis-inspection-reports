INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An infectious disease protocol using hamsters lists the study endpoint as when the animal is noted to be moribund
(immobile), yet immobility, rigidity, and inability to right themselves are listed as clinical signs of disease which
require additional monitoring. The IACUC must ensure the description of procedures in the approved animal use
protocol are able to be clearly understood by research and animal care staff to assure that discomfort and pain to
the animals are limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research.
Correct before the next time hamsters are used in this study.
2.32(c)(1)(iii)
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
In an infectious disease study involving hamsters, some animals were noted by care staff to have health issues.
The facility veterinarian advised the veterinary technician to check on the animals in the morning. This check was
not done until the evening. Some infectious diseases can have a rapid or unpredictable progression of clinical
signs. The facility must ensure that all personnel involved in animal care are instructed in post-procedural care of
animals for their health and well-being. The facility has addressed this item by re-training the involved personnel.
This item has been corrected.
This inspection was conducted on Sept 7-8th with an exit briefing on the 8th with the Associate Vice President of
Research Compliance and the IACUC Coordinator.
