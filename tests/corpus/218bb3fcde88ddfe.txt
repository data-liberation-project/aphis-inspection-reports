SANITATION.
Pest control.
There was an excessive amount of black flies in the buildings. The licensee reports using a spray, however the
amount of flies suggests a more effective pest control program is needed. The upper building'(cid:25)s windows were
open and no screens were in place, which allows flies to enter easily. Excessive amounts of flies in the buildings
can cause animals to get sick and can spread sickness to other animals. To protect animal health and wellbeing,
safe and effective methods for pest control must be in place and maintained.
