2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Required facility records including the program of veterinary care and animal acquisition/disposition records were
not available for review at the time of inspection. The unavailability of the required records for review does not allow
APHIS Officials to determine if the records are accurate and complete, that the program of veterinary care is being
followed to ensure the health of the animals, or for the proper tracking of the animals. All required records at the
facility must be maintained so they are available for review at the time of inspection.
Correct for all future inspections.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
