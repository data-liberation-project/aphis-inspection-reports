Poodle with tag # 29 was found with abnormal nipples. The 9 year old female was recently weaned and the breast
tissue had receded however the nipples remain abnormally lumpy and slightly discolored. This may be a symptom
of serious disease.
Contact the veterinarian and have the dog evaluated. Any guidance from the veterinarian should be followed.
Many of the dogs in the kennel have long nails. Long nails can easily tear and injure the dogs. Keep all nails
properly trimmed to avoid injury.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The feeders are held to the enclosures with bungee cords. The cords are coated with excessive hair and grime.
The cords need to be kept clean.
The water line along the top of the enclosures has a significant amount of fly droppings and general accumulated
grime. The grime needs to be cleaned and the top of the pens kept clean to ensure the health and well-being of the
dogs housed in the facility.
3.6(a)(2)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The outside portion of the enclosures is made from coated wire. The coating is missing from several portions of the
panel. The missing coating exposes the wire which is then too narrow to be acceptable for use on the floor of the
pen. The exposed wire also easily rusts which reduces its strength. The rusty sections cannot be cleaned and
sanitized as necessary. All enclosures must be maintained so the enclosure is safe, strong and sanitizeable.
