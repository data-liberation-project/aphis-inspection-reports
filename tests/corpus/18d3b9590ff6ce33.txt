Facilities, indoor.
The pigs were housed in multiple pens located in one large room. There was a strong smell of ammonia noted by the
inspector upon entering the room and the smell of ammonia was stronger in one end of the room. Ventilation system fans
were running, but the system was not providing effective ventilation to minimize the strong ammonia odor in the housing
room.

Per this Section, indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated at all times by natural or mechanical means to
provide for the health of the animals and to prevent discomfort. Indoor housing facilities shall be provided with fresh air
either by means of windows, doors, vents, fans, or air-conditioning and shall be ventilated to minimize drafts, odors, and
moisture condensation. The licensee needs to address the strong ammonia odor and improve the ventilation of the swine
housing room to minimize odors and for the health of the animals. Correct by 5/27/22.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 5/10/22 with facility representatives.
