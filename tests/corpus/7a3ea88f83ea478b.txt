Facilities, general.
*The frame of the shelter structure in the front pasture housing sheep, goats, and zebu is no longer sound. The frame is
bent and collapsing in places. The covering, typically held up by the frame, is dangling and torn. The structure may
collapse on the animals injuring them and is not providing much protection in its current state.
*A section of the fencing on both the front pasture and the alpaca/llama pasture has become loose from the T posts and
pushed down by the animals. The animals may injure themselves on the loose wire fencing or escape from the pastures.
All outdoor housing facilities, including the fencing and the shelter/shade structures, must be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by 8/24/21.
