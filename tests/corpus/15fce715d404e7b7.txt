2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are no records of acquisition or births for the approximately 1,125 guinea pigs located at the facility. The only
records kept by the licensee are the disposition records when the juvenile guinea pigs are sold.
Lack of acquisition information of animals can make tracing a guinea pig back to it's original source difficult and
guinea pig acquisitions and births must be recorded to maintain an accurate animal count.
Every dealer shall make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the following information:
name and address of person from whom the animals were acquired, USDA license number (if licensed), vehicle
license number and state and driver's license number (if not licensed), date of acquisition, the species and number
of animals in a shipment. Records shall include any offspring born of any guinea pig at the facility.

2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility is sanitizing their guinea pig enclosures with a product called Safeguard CLO2. The product label states
"Eye and skin irritant, harmful if swallowed" and "Do not get in eyes or on skin. Do not ingest". The guinea pigs are
not being removed from the enclosures when the facility is spraying this sanitizer on the enclosure surfaces. Failure
to remove the animals from the enclosures could cause the sanitizer to be sprayed into their eyes and onto their
skin. There is also an increased risk of ingesting the sanitizer if the animals were to groom the spray from their hair
coats. Eye and skin contact with the sanitizer as well as ingesting the sanitizer could have a detrimental impact on
the health of the guinea pigs.
Handling of animals, including cleaning, shall be done as carefully as possible as not to cause trauma, stress, harm
or unnecessary discomfort. While sanitizing the enclosures, the licensee must ensure that the guinea pigs cannot
come into contact with the sanitizer or have the potential to ingest the sanitizer. To be corrected by: From this day forward
3.25(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures are constructed in a manner that places two metal screws alongside the feeder and the water
receptacle. The sharp ends of these screws are located inside the enclosure at the height of the guinea pigs.
Guinea pigs were observed lying up against the sharp points of the screws. The sharp points could cause injury to
the guinea pigs.
The enclosure must protect the animals from injury. The licensee must alter the sharp ends of the screws in a
manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the guinea pigs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe
for the animals at all times.

During the inspection, two guinea pigs were observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of
the building. The licensee had just placed a flake of hay in each enclosure and the hay was up against the 7 inch
high enclosure front. The inspector saw numerous guinea pigs standing on top of the flakes of hay which placed
them above the level of the enclosure fronts. This could create a possible escape method for the guinea pigs.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury as well as the inability to access food and
water.
The enclosure must contain the animals. The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all
times and does not allow them to escape. The inspector and the licensee discussed placing the hay against the
back wall of the enclosure rather than the front and the licensee captured the loose guinea pigs and placed them
back into an enclosure.
To be corrected by: From this day forward ensure that the guinea pigs cannot escape their enclosure by use of the
hay or any other means.
3.25(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The open guinea pig food is kept in a wooden cart that does not have a lid. Food that is unprotected by a lid is at
risk of contamination or spoilage. Food supplies shall be kept in containers with tightly fitted lids or covers. The
licensee must place a tightly fitted lid or cover over the open food contained in the wooden cart in order to reduce
the risk of food contamination or spoilage. To be corrected by: July 8, 2019
3.25(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure, containing approximately twenty-six guinea pigs, there are at least three dead guinea pigs mixed
into the bedding and hay. The live animals were observed running over top of the deceased animals' flattened
bodies. Dead animals could contaminate the bedding and could increase the risk of health hazards towards the
live animals.
Provisions shall be made for the removal and disposal of dead animals, waste, bedding and debris. The licensee
must remove the dead animals and any contaminated bedding to protect the health and well-being of the live guinea
pigs.
To be corrected by: The licensee removed the dead guinea pigs and soiled bedding at the time of the inspection.
3.29(d)
FEEDING.
The facility uses metal self feeders attached to the enclosures to provide feed to the guinea pigs. The licensee is
sanitizing the outside of the metal feeders every two weeks, but stated that the inside of the feeders are not being
sanitized. Failure to sanitize the inside of the feeders could result in food contamination as well as increase the risk
of disease towards the animals.
All food receptacles shall be kept clean and shall be sanitized at least once every two weeks. The licensee must
sanitize the inside and outside of the feeders at least once every two weeks in order to reduce the risk of health
hazards toward the animals.
