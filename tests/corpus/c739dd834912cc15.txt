PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Suspended flooring of enclosures that house dogs, the strands must be greater than 1/8 inch (9 gauge) or be
coated with a material such as plastic or fiberglass. The outside suspended wire runs of the whelping building have
gaps and missing pieces of the plastic covering, leaving bare exposed wire flooring less than the required diameter.
The owner must repair or replace this area and any other areas of flooring that do not meet the Animal Welfare
requirement. This will help in maintaining a healthier and safer environment for dogs. Correct by 04-15-2017.
