FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The goat and sheep yard has a carport and ½ of a very large plastic tank for shelter. The carport is approximately
18 x 20 feet with a top and a wall on the north side. The plastic tank is approximately 6’ wide x 10’ long x 4’ high.
At the time of this inspection there were 30 goats and sheep in the yard. Another 35 goats and sheep were offsite
at a petting zoo. When all animals are at the facility together there will not be enough adequate shelter for all of
them to get out of inclement weather or to provide shade during the summer.
The fallow deer yard had one plastic tank approximately 6’ wide x 10’ long x 4’ high for their shelter. At the time of
this inspection there was 1 female and 1 male in full antlers in the enclosure. The male had to duck his head to get
into the shelter.
Adequate shelter includes allowing the animals to make normal postural adjustment while in that shelter, the ability
to enter or exit the shelter without stepping on or over another animal, and the opportunity to remain shielded from
wind, rain, and sun. The male ducking his head to get into the shelter is not normal postural adjustment. The
plastic tanks do not allow the animals to enter or exit without stepping on or over another animal.
Adequate shelter from inclement weather and shade during the summer must be available for all animals at the
facility at all times. The plastic tanks should not be used as the only shelter for groups of animals.
