3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
There were no shelter structures inside enclosure #28 housing two wolf-dog hybrids named “Quinn” and “Lycia”. The lack
of protective shelter for animals housed outdoors, does not allow adequate protection from the cold, heat, and other
inclement weather and elements. Outdoor facilities for dogs must include one or more shelter structures that are
accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and are large enough to allow each animal in the sheltered structure to
sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.
