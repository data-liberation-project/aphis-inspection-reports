2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a container of an unlabeled bottle containing a white liquid in the refrigerator of the whelping building. The
licensee states that this was a mixture of amoxicillin. There is an expired bottle of oxytocin (14 Jun) and an expired
can of Blu-Kote (05-11) stored with the medications currently in use in the treatment area of the whelping building.
Unlabeled medications can be used incorrectly and be mistaken for other medications. The usage of expired
medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable
veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and
expected results when expired drugs are administrated to animals could be drastically changed or may not work as
anticipated. The applicant must ensure that all medications used are not expired and are labeled properly in
accordance with standard veterinary practices.
The attending veterinarian has a written protocol for this licensee to use for nebulization of the puppies. The
protocol calls for the use of sterile water to be mixed with antibiotics. The licensee is using tap water in place of the
sterile water. Failure to follow directions for treatments from a veterinarian can lead to unintended side effects such
as infections. The licensee must follow all treatment protocols from the attending veterinarian as they are written.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are 15 litters of puppies that range in age from a few days to a few weeks old that do not have their official
identification number assigned to them. Proper record-keeping is essential for tracking the movement of puppies
and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must ensure that identification numbers are assigned to all
puppies. Correct by 13 January 2015.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Portions of a plastic panel on the northwest corner of the east kennel building has been chewed exposing raw
chewed wood beneath it. The bottom portion of a plastic divider panel between two enclosures in the "Sundowner" kennel building has come
loose out of its support. This has resulted in a gap between these enclosures. Dogs may get caught in this gap and
cause injury.
All surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair to securely contain the dogs and protect them from injury.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an excessive accumulation of feces in the outdoor portions of two elevated enclosures and in the outdoor
portions of three enclosures on the ground. According to the kennel facility representative the feces have not been
removed from some of these enclosures for at least three days. Excessive accumulation of feces can contaminate
the dogs and lead to an increase in disease transmission. Feces must be removed from the primary enclosures on
a daily basis. Correct by 7 Jan. 2015.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
