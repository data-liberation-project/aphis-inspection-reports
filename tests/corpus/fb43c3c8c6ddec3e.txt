2.40(b)(4)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Although the authorized method of euthanasia currently being utilized by the facility for guinea pigs is acceptable, the
Program of Veterinary Care on file does not accurately list the method being utilized.
Failure to accurately document guidance provided to facility personnel on euthanasia methods can result in improper
procedures being utilized which may result in distress to the animals.
The Program of Veterinary Care must include adequate guidance to personnel involved in the care and use of animals
regarding euthanasia.
