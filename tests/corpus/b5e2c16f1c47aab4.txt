FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A wicker basket attached to the ceiling for use as perching in the enclosure for bats was in disrepair, with numerous
broken pieces with sharp ends, and may not be structurally sound. The IACUC noted a minor deficiency regarding
the condition of the wicker baskets used for perching in the bat enclosures during the semiannual facility inspection
on September 11, 2014 and assigned a correction date of October 1, 2014 for replacing the baskets. The broken
wicker poses a risk of injury due to the sharp ends and the structural strength poses a risk of injury should the
basket collapse or fall with perched animals inside.
The indoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.
To be corrected by April 25, 2015.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The enclosure housing bats has food material and excreta splattered on all surfaces with excessive accumulation
on the floors under the perches and food table. There are several areas where the paint is peeling, exposing
unsealed concrete surfaces, which can allow the material to collect under the edges of the peeling paint, preventing
its removal. These areas cannot be adequately cleaned or sanitized. This accumulation of food waste and excreta
may attract pests and creates a source for infectious organisms, posing a risk to the health of the animals.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
To be corrected by April 25, 2015.
3.131(c)
SANITATION. The refrigerator used for storing food for the bats had sticky material and food debris along the outside surface of
the door as well as over at least 50 % of the interior surface of the refrigerator where a bucket filled with sliced
watermelon was stored without an intact cover. Sticky material and fruit or vegetable seeds were also found on the
surfaces of glassware stored on a shelf above the food preparation area. This material may attract pests,
contaminate food stored in the refrigerator or prepared on or around these items, and can contaminate the
personnel's hands when opening and accessing food in the refrigerator.
Premises shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set
forth in this subpart.
Accompanied on the inspection by the Animal Facility Manager, veterinary extern, and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson,
DVM. Exit interview conducted by telephone on April 21, 2015 with the Director of Compliance and Operations.
