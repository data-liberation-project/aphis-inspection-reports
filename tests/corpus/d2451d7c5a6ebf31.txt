ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:15 am on
05/27/2015.
Phone calls were made and messages were left on the contact numbers at 9:15 and 9:40 (cell phone number) and
9:17 and 9:42 (house phone number). A facility representative met us at the gate during that time and informed us
that the license or any other facility representative was not available for inspection. The licensee phoned the
inspector at 10:04, after we had left the premises, and confirmed that he was unable to conduct the inspection.
