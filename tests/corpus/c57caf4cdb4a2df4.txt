Minimum floor space.
****
Inside the broker building, the licensee had puppies housed in enclosures that didn't meet the minimum floor space
requirement. There were 8 enclosures housing 18 puppies with inadequate floor space. The puppies in these 8
enclosures and the enclosures themselves were measured to determine if the animals had adequate floor space.
The following enclosures did not have adequate floor space to meet the mininim requirements for these dogs.
The first enclosure was measured and was 30" x 36". This enclosure provided 7.5 square feet of floor space. The
two Husky puppies in this enclosure measured 18" and required 8 square of floor space.
The second enclosure measured was 32" x 36". This enclosure provided 8 square feet of floor space.
The Bloodhound puppy in this enclosure was measured at 24" in length and the Great Pyrenees mix puppy in the
same enclosure measured 22" requiring 11.65 square feet of floor space to meet the minimum requirements.
The third enclosure measured was 40" x 36". This enclosure provided 10 square feet of floor space. This
enclosure housed 4 Golden Doodle puppies, two pups measuring 16" and two at 17" they required 14 square feet
of floor space to meet the minimum requirements.
There were two enclosures measuring 32" x 36". These enclosures provided 8 square feet of floor space. Both
enclosures housed 3 Golden Doodle puppies each , these 6 pups measuring 16" and required 10 square feet of
floor space to meet the minimum requirements.
There were two enclosures measuring 34 x 36". These enclosures provided 8.5 square feet of floor space. Both
enclosures housed 2 Mastiff puppies each, these puppies measuring 23" and required 11.68 square feet of floor
space to meet the minimum requirements.
The last enclosure measured was 32" x 36". This enclosure provided 8 square feet of floor space. The
two Mastiff puppies housed in this enclosure measured 23" and required 11.68 square of floor space.
The minimum space requirement is important for the health and well-being of the puppies. The licensee must
ensure that all animals are housed in enclosures that meet or exceed the minimum floor space requirement.
