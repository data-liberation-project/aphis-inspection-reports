ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 on
09-AUG-17.
** I arrived in the area at 11:30 am. I texted before getting to the facility due to no cellular/data reception. The
owners texted me back stating that they were unavailable to conduct the inspection until later that day. I let the
owners know that I could not wait and that this would be an attempted inspection. I left the area at 12:00 pm.
