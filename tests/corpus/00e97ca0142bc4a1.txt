ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of this inspection the Program of Veterinary Care was available for review. However, the document seen
today was dated 2009. The additional signature sheet was not available. The document reviewed today had a
variety of animals noted that are no longer on the premise. Therefore, this document needs to be amended to
correctly identify the animals on the premise.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
During this inspection it was noted that the records were not current. No records were available for the newly
acquired zebus or hedgehog. Nor was documentation made on the goat births. All deaths, births, acquisitions and
dispositions need to be documented. All records need to be kept current, accurate, and complete at all times.

An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 23, 2016.
