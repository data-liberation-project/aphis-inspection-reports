INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) last met February 10, 2015. A report
summarizing the IACUC's findings regarding the program review and facility inspection has not been prepared or
delivered to the Institutional Official (IO). Organizing the IACUC's findings into the semi-annual report provides a
means of accountability for correcting identified deficiencies and therefore helps assure optimal animal welfare. The
IACUC shall prepare reports of its evaluations conducted during the semi-annual program review and facility
inspection, and submit the reports to the Institutional Official. The reports shall be updated at least once every six
months upon completion of the required semi-annual evaluations and shall be maintained by the research facility
and made available to APHIS officials for inspection.

considered. THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED.
