ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* "Cherry Cheese" (#048-299-860) a female Shiba Inu was noticed to be non- weight bearing on her right front leg.
There appeared to be a possible bite mark on the leg although no swelling or discharge was seen. When asked
about the injury, it was stated that she had just been placed in the pen yesterday and had gotten into a fight with the
male. Although the licensee had noted the injury, there was no documentation of injury/ treatment action plan nor
had a veterinarian been notified. This dog must be seen by the veterinarian for a consult/treatment of the injury.
Documentation of the visit and any treatment protocol must be available to the inspector upon request.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
An enclosure in the whelping building (containing 1 adult dog and 8 puppies) had a build up of dirt, grime and feces
along the interior walls of the enclosure and smeared feces on the floor in the outdoor run area. Five enclosures
(containing 10 dog total) had a build up of dirt, grime and hair that was hard- packed along the edges of the
enclosure. Various areas in the enclosures also had collections of old, wet hair, dirt and feces stuck on the cement
flooring with flies hanging around those areas. These types of accumulations of organic matter increase disease
hazards, can soil the dogs and encourage insects/ pests that may bite or cause stress to the dogs. Licensee must
ensure that the enclosures are cleaned at least daily to prevent accumulations of organic matter, minimize disease
hazards and to help reduce the number of pest that may be harmful to the dogs.
