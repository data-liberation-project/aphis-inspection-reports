2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:15 a.m. on
13-DEC-18.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 10:15 a.m. and was not able to locate anyone. I called the animal caretaker
and left a voicemail message, then waited at the facility for 30 minutes before leaving.
