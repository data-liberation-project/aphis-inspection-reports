3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Spider Monkey Enclosure:
- Several wooden, plank-type platforms in the enclosure had moderately, peeling paint exposing underlying raw,
unsealed wood.
-There were several areas with a heavy buildup of rust including some areas of corrosion on the metal, ladder-type
structures next to the large, den box area.
Surfaces which cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized such as rusted surfaces or unsealed, raw wood are porous
and can trap debris, bacteria, or other harmful organisms which may pose a disease or health risk to the animals.
The surfaces of housing facilities-including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses, dens, and other furniture-type
fixtures or objects within the facility-must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be
readily cleaned, sanitized, and maintained on a regular basis or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Hyena enclosure: The wooden resting platform in front of the den box was heavily, worn and ragged with
splintered edges. Also, there were several areas of heavy wearing and splintering of the wooden den box along the
top edges and along the edges of the opening.
-Tiger enclosures: The elevated, wooden platforms in several of the Tiger enclosures were heavily, worn with
roughened and splintered wood.
-Big cat enclosure: There was a hanging rubber, tire which was heavily, worn and frayed exposing the fibers and
inner materials. -Black Bear Enclosure: There was small gate opening to this enclosure which was not adequately secured
considering the species. The gate was attached to the adjacent metal support poles by only two pin-hinges.
Additionally, this gate and the support poles had a moderate buildup of rust in several areas.
All enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from potential injury
and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and maintenance must be in place.
