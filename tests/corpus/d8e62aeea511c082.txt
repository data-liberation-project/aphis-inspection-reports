2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Facility personnel stated that a part time attending veterinarian is available to provide health services for the animals
at this facility. However, the formal arrangements do not include a written program of veterinary care and personnel
were unsure if the current health program includes any preventative measures such as vaccines, foot care and
deworming.
A writen program of veterinary care must be created, documented and followed as directed by the attending
veterinarian and must include regularly scheduled visits to the premises in order to comply with the provision of
adequate veterinary care as required under the Animal Welfare Act.

2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Hoof care has not been a regular part of preventative health care for the goats at this facility. At least one goat seen
during this inspection was noted to have overgrown hooves. Lack of a preventative foot care program can cause
health problems in goats, including lameness and the inability to eat properly.
The attending veterinarian should be consulted to create, implement and maintain an ongoing program for hoof care
including trimming, in order to meet industry standards for goat husbandry and health care. Any goats with
overgrown hooves or other foot problems should be examined and treated as directed by the attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A gate, on the interior of the animal facility used for feeding and night confinement of the goats and sheep, hasmetal fencing attached to it which is bent, damaged and pulled away from the gate frame especially at the bottom. A
single piece of fence is projecting away from the back of the gate and has a sharp point on the end which could
cause injury. The animals could also become tangled in the damaged fence. Since the gate is maintained in the
open position, the back of the gate is accessible to the animals.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to prevent injury to the animals. The
gate should be repaired or replaced.

SANITATION.
Hundreds of rodent droppings mixed with animal feed were identified on a table and along all four interior walls of
the feed storage building. Although a rodenticide was also noted in this building and may be in use, the
effectiveness of the current pest control program could not be assessed because of the significant number of
droppings noted in the building.
An effective pest control program must be established and maintained to reduce the chance of food contamination
and the risk of disease transmission to the animals by large numbers of rodents in the animal areas. The facility
should review the current pest control program to ensure its effectiveness. Housekeeping practices including the
removal of spilled and loose feed may need to be accelerated in order to accurately review the current program.
