ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a bottle of Marguis in a bottle with a hand-written label in the storage area with other medicines. The
expiration date was not written on the label. Expired medications may lose their effectiveness. When the expiration
date is unknown, the medication cannot be used with certainty that it is effective. All medication must be properly
labeled, including an expiration date.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an opened bag of shavings inside the storage area of the building. Open bags of bedding may attract
rodents, insects and other pests that may contaminate the bedding material. To prevent contamination of bedding
material, opened bags must be kept in leakproof containers with a tightly fitting lid. The shavings must be placed in
a leakproof container with a tightly fitting lid.
3.3(e)(1)(3)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The wood frame of the gates has not been treated to make it impervious to moisture (as stated by the facility
representative). When water was splashed on the wood, it soaked into the wood, instead of beading up and
running off. Wood that is not impervious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized and it can soak up
water and swell and lose its structural integrity. The wood must be sealed to prevent these from happening.
This inspection was done on a new site for the licensee. When the noncompliant items are corrected the licensee
should contact the inspector for further inspection.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted by Katy Vernon, ACI with facility representatives.
