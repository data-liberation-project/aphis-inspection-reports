On Tuesday February 16th at 1:15 PM, a responsible person was not available to conduct an inspection. The inspector
contacted the licensee by cell phone. The licensee stated that he had to leave the facility and would not be available until
5:00 PM that day. This is the first attempted inspection. The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to
conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare
Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
