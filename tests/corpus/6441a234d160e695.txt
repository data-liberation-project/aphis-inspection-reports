ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several bottles of expired drugs were found during this inspection. Since it cannot be determined if the use of
expired drugs will produce the desired effect they were intended to in a medical application, expired drugs are not
considered adequate veterinary care and should not be used. Expired drugs must be removed from current
medication and labeled as expired. A regular program of drug inventory and removal of expired drugs should be
started and maintained.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The large metal dry feed storage box, outside of the kitchen, has old spilled dry kibble on the bottom of the
container. There did not appear to be any broken bags so this was most likely spilled feed during the process of
opening bags for feeding. This spilled feed needs to be cleaned up to prevent the possibility of molding or insect
contamination.
A regular schedule of checking and cleaning this feed storage box needs to be in place and maintained.
