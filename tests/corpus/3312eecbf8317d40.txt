3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Mouse droppings were noted on the floor along the walls and on door frames in both non-human primate indoor
portions of the sheltered housing. In one of the buildings some mouse bait was noted on a counter with droppings
adjacent. The current program of pest control does not seem to be sufficient or effective to control the mice. Mice as
pests can contaminate feed and bedding and can transmit disease. The facility shall devise a new written plan for
rodent control with the assistance of their attending veterinarian to ensure methods used are safe around the
animals. An effective program for control of pests must be established and maintained. Correct by April 15, 2015.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
