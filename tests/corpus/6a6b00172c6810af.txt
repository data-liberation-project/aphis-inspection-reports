2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A buff colored female Cocker Spaniel,tag #141, was walking normally and was then observed momentarily scooting
her ventral body with her hind legs dragging behind her, as if she were scratching her belly, on the gravel-type
flooring of an outdoor enclosure. On closer observation of the dog no abnormalities were noted on the dog(cid:25)s
abdomen, legs or body except the dog(cid:25)s right ear had an excessive amount of discharge. Most of the entire inner
ear flap appeared reddened and moist with an abundant thick creamy white to yellow discharge present at the
entrance to the ear canal and surrounding area. The fur in this area appeared moistened with the discharge; some
of the fur appeared darker black and matted around the edges of the canal on the inner ear flap. When the licensee
was asked if he had noticed the dog(cid:25)s ear condition he replied, "(cid:28)no"(cid:29). This dog(cid:25)s ear condition could indicate an
infection, allergy or other veterinary medical condition which could cause discomfort.
A white and golden male Lhasa Apso, microchip #0A02201909, was initially observed with a large lesion on the
right side near its shoulder. On closer observation the lesion on the right side appeared to be a large healed scar.
While the licensee was holding the dog, he was asked to move his hand so the left side of the dog(cid:25)s neck could be
viewed. The dog had a wound located on the left side of his neck. An approximately 2 inch open linear
laceration-like lesion was noted on the neck. The wound was open with exposed red tissue underneath and a thick
creamy whitish discharge was present in and around the lesion. Fur was present up to the open wound and did not
appear clipped. The surrounding fur immediately around the wound and extending down the neck was discolored
black and significantly matted. Some of the visible skin under the fur in this area appeared reddened. The licensee
seemed surprised at first that a wound was present on the left side of the dog(cid:25)s neck. However, when the licensee
was asked if he was aware of the dog(cid:25)s condition he said that he had noticed the wound a few days ago and it was
from a dog fight. He stated that he had started treating the dog with peroxide, penicillin and "(cid:28)Mag-60"(cid:29). The
inspection started at approximately 11:00am and the licensee said that he had not given the dog treatment yet
today. The licensee had not consulted with a veterinarian regarding treatment of this dog. There was no
documentation from a veterinarian regarding treatment of this dog(cid:25)s condition. Wounds increase the risk of infection
and pain.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that accurate
diagnoses are obtained and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must documentthis information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The licensee is currently using a jar of medication (Mag-60 Paste) and a bottle of injectable medication (Agri-Cillin)
on a Lhasa Apso, microchip #0A02201909, with a wound on his neck. The jar of Mag-60 does have a label from a
veterinarian but it is specifically labeled for use on Bovine. Neither of these medications are labeled for use in dogs
nor does the licensee have instructions from a veterinarian on the proper use and dosages. Medication not labeled
for use in dogs could have an adverse effect and/or may be harmful to the animal if not used as intended. The
licensee must consult with a veterinarian and obtain written directions for the use of any medications being used
other than the way the labels states.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
****
The wooden floor of an enclosure housing 5 puppies is no longer impervious to moisture. There are areas of this
floor that had been recently cleaned that had became soaked with the water. Surfaces of animal enclosures in
contact with the animals must be impervious to moisture in order to prevent them from being soaked with urine and
waste water and to facilitate the required cleaning and sanitization. The licensee must seal, paint,or otherwise make
these surfaces impervious to moisture. The licensee must develop a program of monitoring and maintenance to
ensure that all surfaces in contact with the animals are impervious to moisture as required by the regulations.
