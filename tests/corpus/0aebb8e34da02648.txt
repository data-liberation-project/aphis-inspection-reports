An adult male South African Boerbol USDA tag # 140 was found to have a draining area associated with a circular
mass that was the size of a softball on the outside of his right knee. On the area there was a 1.5in circular area of
hairloss. This area was pink and moist. The area was speculated to be a draining abscess. The facility
representative indicated that area had not been treated but he had been changing the bedding in the enclosure to
assist with the healing. The animal was placed on a leash and made to walk for several minutes and run, no limp
was noticed at the time of the inspection. The mass did not appear hot to the touch and the animal did not show
signs of discomfort when the area was palpated. The facility representative said that this was not the first time an
abscess had been noticed on this dog. There was also significant scarring on the outside of the left knee where
there was a previous abscess was said to be.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Flies were found in multiple areas in the dog housing area. In the whelping areas and covered the dividers of the
enclosures. Efforts have been made to reduce the number of flies in the whelping area by putting up fly strips. The
windows are open with 1in by 1 in wire covering the openings. This will keep out larger pests, but does not assist
with fly reduction. The outdoor enclosure has a high number of flies around the food. The highest number of flies
was observed around the outside pen with nursing Boerbol puppies. Pests and their feces can serve as a source of
infection for the dogs in the kennel. Correct by establishing a pest control program that effectively controls all pests,
including flies, and prevents contamination of the environment by pests and their feces.
