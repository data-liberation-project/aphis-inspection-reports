Additionally, a vial of Penicillin G inj is currently being used to treat primates BA 74, AD 65, BP 15, & BK 19. When
this was discovered by this inspector during the inspection the veterinarian immedialtey changed the treatment to a
different antibiotic.
Expired medications are considered adulterated, and their use is not an appropriate method to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
The facility currently has a system for identifying expired medications, but it appears that this system is not entirely
effective. Institute improvements to assure that expired medications are removed and not administered to any
animals.

On June 28, 2015, a person (or persons) entered the facility and facilitated the escape of 11 primates from their
enclosure. Ten of these primates were either captured or returned to their enclosure on their own. One primate is
still missing.The facility inspected the perimeter fence and did not find any cuts or openings along the fence. An inspection of
the perimeter fence today showed that there was a space between the 2 service gates adjacent to the enclosure
which could be moved a few inches by hand. There was also a space between the bottom of another service gate
and the ground near enclosures 163/164 which also can be moved a few inches by hand. The perimeter fence is
not 6 feet high on the left side of the old feed bunker, and this section shall be raised to at least 6 feet high.
The perimeter fence shall restrict unauthorized persons (and animals) from entering the facility and having contact
with the animals. The perimeter fence shall be at least 6 feet high along its entire length.
Since this incident, the facility has provided additional security measures.
