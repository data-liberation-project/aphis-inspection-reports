ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:00 pm on
18-Dec-19.
I came to the residence at 1:30 pm where I knocked on the door and left a phone message and waited 20 minutes
in the area. I came back at 3:00 pm and was unable to get a response at the door and made contact with the
licensee by phone. I was advised that there was no one available to take me on an inspection, and while there was
a responsible adult at home they were not comfortable going on the inspection. The licensee preferred that only he
or his sons came on the inspection, however neither were unavailable.
