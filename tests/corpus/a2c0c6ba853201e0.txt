HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** The primary enclosure containing 3 pigs has a sign stating that they bite. The facility is a petting zoo but the pigs
are not to be petted. The pigs enclosure is constructed of fencing material that can allow the public to put their
hands through it. There isn't any public attendant present or public barriers in place to ensure that no one will put
their hands in the enclosure and get bit. The pigs exhibit should have sufficient distance and/or barriers between the
animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of the animals and the public. Correct by October

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** There were two young goats outside of their primary enclosure. When the goats were placed back in their primary
enclosure they immediately jumped out again. These young goats can't be properly contained in their enclosure
because the fencing is too short. These younger more agile goats require a fence high enough to appropriately
contain them. Correct by October 16, 2015

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the storage facility there were bags of feed, bedding and mineral blocks that were being stored on the ground.

mineral blocks as well. The feed, bedding and mineral blocks should be stored to keep it from becoming
contaminated by vermin. The storage facility may also need to be repaired and/or replaced to ensure the facility is
sealed from vermin getting in to access the feed or bedding. Correct by October 1, 2015.
