Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was an excessive amount of flies inside and outside of the facility. The flies on the outside of the building were
covering the PVC pipe used on top of enclosure dividers and were regular sized flies. The flies inside the building were
small flies, they were on the walls and washdowns with about 40 flies per sqft.. The flies were also around the food, feces,
and damp areas. There was a fly reel strip along the ceiling inside the kennel that was rolled to expose new tape during
the inspection. Pests, such as flies, increase the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must develop a program of safe
and effective pest control to reduce or eliminate the population of flies.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
