3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures for the four exotic felines were in need of repair:
- Wire mesh panels are damaged or rusted, exposing pointed wire ends, brittle rusted wire that was falling into
pieces, and openings that pose a risk of entanglement or escape.
- In the enclosure for "Mystery" the floor of the den is cement, and the paint is peeling, and the cement is pitted,
appears porous, and is deteriorating. The condition of this surface makes it difficult to adequately clean and
disinfect, especially since raw meat is often served on this surface.
- The enclosure between "Nurani" and "Kikitu" has wire mesh around a tree limb that has been patched, and has
sharp point that could cause injury.
- In the enclosure for "Kikitu" there is some serious wood rot toward the ceiling that creates concern about the
structural strength of the enclosure. In the enclosure for "Khonsu" there is rusted wire mesh above that results in
pieces of wire dropping into the enclosure. These could become adhered to food and ingested.
Enclosures should be maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury or escape.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one storage shed the bedding straw was stored on the floor, and was strewn about, and a bag of shavings was
open. Considering that this facility continues to battle a rodent problem, this storage does not adequately protect the
bedding materials from vermin. In the small shed where the hay for the goats and alpaca are stored, there were
many rodent droppings throughout the shed, and the hay is clearly not being adequately protected from vermin
contamination.
Food and bedding should be stored in a manner which adequately protects it against deterioration, molding, or
contamination by vermin. Failure to properly store animal food could be detrimental to the animals.This inspection was conducted on 3/12/19 with a facility representative. Paperwork was reviewed, and an exit
interview occurred with the director on 3/18/19.
