FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two access gates on the rear portions to the longhorn cattle enclosure and the llama enclosure are in need of
repair. The gate for the cattle is attached by one hinge and a chain. This gate is leaning resulting in a gap between
the gate and the fence. The gate for the llama cannot be completely closed due to a build-up of dirt at the bottom of
the gate. This is creating a gap between the gate and the fence. Animals could be trapped in these gaps which can
cause injury. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to securely contain the animals. Correct by 8 Jan. 2017.
