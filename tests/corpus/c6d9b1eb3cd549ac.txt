2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) provided upon request is incomplete. Items missing include a
signature page indicating a formal contract between the Attending Veterinarian (AV) and the Licensee, adequate
coverage for emergency care if regular veterinarian is unavailable, and several species not included in the program
(pot belly pigs, javelinas, lemurs, and African crested porcupines). An incomplete PVC can lead to a lack of
provision of adequate veterinary care to the animals.
A drug not indicated in the PVC was reportedly administered to the zebras in February, 2017 (ivermectin). Any
routinely used drugs need to be noted in the PVC.
Each dealer and exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a
part-time attending veterinarian, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care. Correct
by July 23, 2017.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** During this inspection four animals were noted in need of veterinary care. There were no records or
documentation available for review regarding any observations or treatments administered for any of the four
animals. The facility representative stated that she was unaware of any current treatment being administered and
was unaware of whether or not the attending veterinarian may have examined the animals.
Three aoudad were noted limping. Two of them (tag # 229 and 504) appeared to be lame on their left rear legs. One
of them was noted resting the tip of the hooves on the ground instead of bearing weight on the left rear leg while
standing. A third aoudad (no tag) was noted running toward the vehicle and was non-weight bearing on the front
right leg. While standing it rested the tip of the hooves on the ground rather than placing weight on the leg.
One young sika deer was noted with multiple wounds on its' right side, especially over the forequarters, head, and
face. The wounds appeared to be a few days old as there was no fresh blood present. Some of the wounds were
large, up to 2 in by 4 in in size. The haircoat is missing and red flesh is visible.
Untreated veterinary medical problems can lead to pain and distress to the animals and may progress to havingserious consequences if remaining untreated. All veterinary observations, diagnoses and treatments should be
documented in writing to allow all employees to know the status of and treatment required for the animals and for
the veterinarians to ensure adequate care is provided. These four animals need to be evaluated as described in the
written program of veterinary care and a diagnosis and treatment plan need to be ascertained and documented.
***Components of the available PVC are not being followed and/or are not being recorded as being performed.
Deworming and vaccination schedules outlined in the PVC cannot be verified to meet the timelines required by the
AV. The ability to determine which animals receive what treatments is necessary to ensure adequate veterinary
care.
***The current PVC indicates that for all hoofstock species, except Blackbuck and Nilgai, succinylcholine is and will
continue to be the sole agent used for capture, transport, and chemical restraint for procedures such as exams and
lameness treatment. During conversations with facility representatives it was ascertained that succinylcholine is still
the sole drug being used to immobilize hoofstock. Bottles of succinylcholine were present at the facility. The
veterinarian-approved instructions discuss the care and monitoring of the animal during the use of the
neuromuscular blocker but make no mention of the fact that during immobilization with neuromuscular blocking
agents, the animals remain fully conscious and are sensitive to pain, stress and stimulation. Succinylcholine is a
paralytic agent that has no pain relieving or tranquilizing properties. In addition, this type of drug paralyzes
respiratory muscles, causing decreases in respiration rate that can be severe enough to lead to death if the animals
are not ventilated appropriately. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities or training to intubate or
mechanically ventilate animals if they stop breathing. Neuromuscular blockers such as succinylcholine should not
be used without concurrent appropriate use of anesthesia/analgesia and support measures (ventilation and
monitoring) to avoid the distressing effects, respiratory depression and enhanced risk of death due to paralysis of
respiratory muscles. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available which are able to
chemically restrain animals without causing paralysis while providing anesthesia and analgesia. The licensee must
maintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods of immobilizing and restraining
hoofstock that are consistent with currently accepted professional standards of adequate veterinary care.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three significantly lame aoudads and one sika deer with facial and shoulder injuries were noted during the
inspectors' drive through. The facility representative indicated that they had not noticed these injured animals.
Inadequate observation of animals can lead to pain and distress in animals not receiving prompt ,appropriate
veterinary care. Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being coupled with a mechanism of
direct, frequent communication with the AV is required. Correct from this day forward.
2.75(b)(1)RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records of acquisition, disposition and animals on-hand are incomplete. A complete recorded inventory was
completed on March 3, 2017 - 10 weeks ago. Since then, multiple births in several species have occurred without
being recorded (for example, pot belly pigs). Numbers of animals recorded as being on-hand differ significantly
from numbers counted during this inspection's inventory count (for example, kangaroo). Inaccurate/incomplete
record keeping can lead to inadequate provision of care and support for the numbers of animals at a facility. Per
this section, every dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the
detailed information contained in this section. Correct by July 23, 2017.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public is permitted to walk directly up to the primary enclosures containing several species of animals including
goats, sheep, zebu cattle, llama, and camels. These animals are housed in multiple areas including the walk
through area (for the sheep, goats, zebu, camels and llama) and the wagon loading area where one camel is
housed in a horse stall. There are no barriers present at the walk through area to discourage public contact and the
guests can feed food sold at the entry gate. During this inspection, no public visitors were noted in this area of the
park due to poor weather. The facility representative stated that an employee has been hired to work Fridays
through Mondays as an attendant in the area. However, there was no attendant present during this inspection on a
Tuesday. Guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals since primary enclosure fences are made
of material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch the animals. Unattended public
contact does not ensure safe public interaction with the animals. The licensee must ensure that during periods of
public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general
viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public
contact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these
locations to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Guests are permitted to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. During this inspection the poor weather
resulted in few visitors driving themselves through the park although a few cars and vans were seen by the
inspectors. The drive through park appeared to be operating in the same manner as during previous inspections.
Employees continue to drive the horse-drawn wagons and monitor the visitors on their wagon. However, no
attendants were present in the drive through area when the unaccompanied personal vehicle visits were taking
place. During this inspection, the inspectors noticed guests feeding animals through car windows and no employees
were noted in the vicinity. A hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the entry gate advises them to remain in theirvehicles at all times but does not discourage feeding. Allowing guests to feed from vehicles without attendants
present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a barrier or distance from the animals and
the public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all times during public contact.
3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Three ringtail lemurs are currently housed in an enclosure in the giraffe barn made of wire with openings large
enough that the lemurs can extend their hands and forearms through the openings. A plugged in, loosely hanging,
red electrical extension cord was noted running along the back of the enclosure about 1 1/2 to 2 in. away from the
enclosure. When the facility representative started to move the cord to remove it, one of the lemurs was observed
placing its arm through the opening and grabbing at the cord. Playing with and potentially biting a plugged in
electrical cord can lead to severe injury to the lemur. The housing buildings must be kept clean and in good repair in
order to protect the lemurs from injury. Corrected during this inspection.
3.127(b) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Inadequate shelter from heavy rain was unavailable to approximately 20% of the sheep and goats in the
walk-through area, including multiple lambs and kids. One of the two shelters contained heaps of old bedding
material. The other shelter was overflowing with animals, causing others to huddle outside against the buildings.The
tree-covered area of the enclosure had water flowing through it. The inability to remain dry during inclement
weather can impact the health of the animals, especially the young. Per this section, natural or artificial shelter shall
be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
