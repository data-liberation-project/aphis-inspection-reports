2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Within the wildlife exhibit area there is an enclosure containing four deer. The enclosure is made out of welded wire
fencing and is near a public walkway. There is no barrier to prevent the public from touching and/or sticking their
fingers through the wire fence and having direct contact with the animals in the enclosure. There is no attendant
present in this portion of the facility to monitor this enclosure. This poses a hazard to both the public and the
animals within the exhibit. During public exhibition, there must be sufficient distance and/or effective barriers
between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.
