FEEDING.
Excessive rodent feces are present in the kitchen of the facility. Mouse feces were observed on the counter top
used to store fresh produce that is used to feed the animals. The feces were located directly under the wire bins
containing apples, bananas, pears, and squash. Additionally, excessive amounts of rodent feces were observed
the on the floor beneath the same counter top. Rodents can carry and spread diseases that affect animals.

SANITATION.
Excessive rodent feces were observed in the kitchen of the facility. The feces were located on the counter top used
to store produce and on the floor beneath the counter top. The facility animal care director indicated that the mouse
feces in this area were last cleaned a few days ago. The facility does have an existing pest control program for the
rodents in place, however; the feces must be cleaned/removed with increased frequency to assure that the pest
control methods are effectively controlling the rodents. Mouse feces can contain diseases that make the animals ill.
Clean/remove the rodent feces and repeat often enough to assure that the pest control provisions are effectively
controlling the rodent population.
