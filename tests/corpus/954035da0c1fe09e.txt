3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Six small breed puppies were housed outdoors in two chain link kennels, containing three puppies each. Both
kennels had damaged areas where the chain link was pulled away from the metal support frame at the bottom. The
damaged areas resulted in holes or gaps above the metal supports and crumpled chain link at the level of the
puppies. Additionally, ends of the heavy gauge chain link wire were exposed, turned toward the interior of the
kennels and accessible to the puppies in multiple areas.
Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The animals could
become entangled in the damaged fencing and contact with the exposed ends of heavy wire could cause injury. The
damaged areas and wire ends should be repaired, replaced or removed.
