RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records on hand are inaccurate. A sugar glider joey sold this year in February was recorded as having been
born to parents which, with further investigation, was found to be incorrect. It was determined that two glider joeys
which were sold this year in April were born to those parents, while the parentage of the joey sold in February is
unknown at this time. Accurate records are important for determining health trends of animals on hand and provide
a valuable tool for making animal health decisions. Animal lives may be negatively impacted when records are
erroneous. Licensee must make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required
information.
