Requirements and application
This was a search inspection conducted to determine if regulated activity is being conducted by this facility. On April 4,
2022, this facility owner was contacted by the USDA inspector by phone inquiring about the business and how puppies
are sold. The owner stated she only sells puppies directly to their new owners and requires all new owners to come pick
up the puppy. However, the owner also stated that she did end up having to ship a dog with a third party to a new owner
in the United Kingdom. It was discussed and confirmed that there are more than four breeding females on site.
This activity requires a USDA license.
No regulated activity is permitted until a USDA license is obtained.
A USDA license application packet was sent to the facility along with this report.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the representative.
