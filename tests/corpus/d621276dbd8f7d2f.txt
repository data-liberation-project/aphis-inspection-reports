RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The acquisition records are not up to date. There was no record of acquisition for the one Australian opposum. The
acquisition records accounted for 6 rabbits. At least sixteen rabbits were counted during the inspections. One
enclosure housed adult guinea pigs with offspring. The acquisition records reviewed did not include any offspring
born at the premises. Complete and accurate acquisition records must be kept to allow accurate identification of the
animals and to allow medical and legal tracking. The facility shall make, keep and maintain records that fully and
correctly include all required acquisition information and they shall include any offspring born of any animal at the
facility. Correct by Oct. 17th, 2019.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Several rabbits were observed to be taking shelter to avoid direct sunlight. Two rabbits in the enclosure were seen
to have elevated respiratory rates (approximately 160 breaths per minute) and were stretched out on their sides. A
kestrel was placed at the level of one of the rabbits and measured 99.6F. Refrigerated carrots were brought out and
used to lure the rabbits out of their shelter. Once they began consuming the carrots, their behaviors normalized and
their respiratory rates lowered. Rabbits are sensitive to excessive heat and prone to heat stress. Heat stress is
detrimental to the health and welfare of animals. Licensees shall provide artificial cooling when the atmospheric
temperature exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Correct by September 20th, 2019.

FEEDING.
The current diet fed to the marmosets is a homemade diet consisting of shrimp or ham, cheese, fruit, cereal and
applesauce. No commercial marmoset diet is being fed. No veterinary nutritional evaluation of the current diet has
been made. Marmosets require very specific levels of vitamins C and D in their diet to maintain a healthy condition
and to meet their normal daily nutritional requirements. The diet for the marmosets must be appropriate for
marmosets according to generally accepted professional and husbandry practices and nutritional standards. Correct
