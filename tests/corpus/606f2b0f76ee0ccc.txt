2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A guinea pig (white body with yellow/black head markings across from pen #12) has problems with the left eye.
This has not been seen by the attending veterinarian nor communicated to the attending veterinarian since the last
inspection. The left eye could not be seen and the area around the left eye appeared to be wet or crusty which is a
sign of an eye problem. This guinea pig must be seen by the attending veterinarian to determine if it can be treated
and assure that it is not something that can spread to other guinea pigs in the building. Health problems must be
communicated promptly to the attending veterinarian to assure animal health.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
