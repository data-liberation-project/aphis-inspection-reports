3.51(c)

Facilities, indoor.
One rabbit is housed in an approximately 20ft x 20ft building. The building has approximately five recessed lights. The
enclosure is dark. The amount of light is insufficient and not uniformly distributed. Inadequate lighting prevents thorough
observation of animals and husbandry practices which could affect animal health and well-being. The licensee must
ensure that housing facilities have adequate lighting that is uniformly diffused and permits routine inspection, cleaning of
the facility, and observation of all animals.
3.76(c)

Indoor housing facilities.
One ring-tailed lemur and one olive baboon are housed in an approximately 20ft x 20ft building. The building has
approximately five recessed lights. The enclosures are dark. The amount of light is insufficient and not uniformly
distributed. Inadequate lighting prevents thorough observation of animals and husbandry practices which could affect
animal health and well-being. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities have adequate lighting that is uniformly
diffused and permits routine inspection, cleaning of the facility, and observation of the nonhuman primates.
3.80(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.


An enclosure housing one ring-tailed lemur was constructed of 2x4’s and chain link. Plywood sheets lined three sides of
the enclosure. These sheets extended approximately 2 feet high. The top edges of the plywood sheets were in disrepair
with rough edges. The 2x4’s composing the enclosure door were also in disrepair. The surfaces were rough and small
slivers of wood were observed peeling off. Failure to maintain enclosure surfaces can lead to animal injury. The licensee
must ensure primary enclosures are designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primate contained in them and kept in good repair.
3.80(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
An enclosure housing one ring-tailed lemur was constructed of 2x4’s and chain link. Plywood sheets lined three sides of
the enclosure. These sheets extended approximately 2 feet high. The surfaces of the 2x4’s and plywood were not sealed.
In one corner of the enclosure door, the 2x4 was stained and there was a build-up of a dark brown material. Inappropriate
enclosure surfaces which are unable to be appropriately cleaned and sanitized can lead to inadequate husbandry
practices and potential animal disease. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are constructed and maintained so
that they enable all surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates to be readily cleaned and sanitized in accordance with
3.84(b)(3) of this subpart or replaced when worn or soiled.
3.126(c)

Facilities, indoor.
One kinkajou and one woodchuck are housed in an approximately 20ft x 20ft building. The building has approximately five
recessed lights. The enclosures are dark. The amount of light is insufficient and not uniformly distributed. Inadequate
lighting prevents thorough observation of animals and husbandry practices which could affect animal health and well-
being. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities have adequate lighting that is uniformly diffused and permits
routine inspection, cleaning of the facility, and observation of all animals.
