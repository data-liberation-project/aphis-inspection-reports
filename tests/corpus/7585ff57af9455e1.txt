ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male red kangaroo has a thickened right forelimb. The area of the limb just above the paw and extending
about halfway up the limb is thicker than the left forelimb. Licensee stated the right limb has always been bigger
than the left, and maybe now it is larger still. The kangaroo walks and uses the limb without any apparent
restrictions. The thickened limb may indicate underlying injury or disease. Licensee must use appropriate methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The male red kangaroo must be examined by a
licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and
plan shall be maintained by Licensee for examination by APHIS officials.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are many animals of various species present at the facility. Animals are routinely bought, sold, and are born
on the premises. Occasionally, animals die while at the facility. Licensee does not currently maintain records of
these events. Without records it is impossible to verify productivity and health management, or trace animals in the
event of a disease outbreak. Licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the
required information, such as all animals which are born, acquired, transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some of the animal enclosures have fencing which is loose or has holes at the ground level. During inspection, one
of the smaller pot-bellied pigs came out of the drive through enclosure by scooting under the fence, walked across
the parking lot, and went into the enclosure with the large farm pig. Loose animals are at a higher risk for injury and
may cause accidents with the public. Facilities, including animal enclosures, shall be structurally sound and shall
be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
