ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection it was noted that the two male goats, that were housed with the 2 llamas, were in need of
attention. As I approached the enclosure I noticed that both goats had clear, nasal discharge around their nostrils.
To ensure that these animals are provided the appropriate veterinary care they will need to be seen by the attending
veterinarian.
To Be Corrected By: COB - The attending vet was called while I was present.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
