2.40(a)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There have been no changes to the written program of veterinary care since the last routine inspection. The attending
veterinarian does not have appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care with respect to
dosing, frequency, and rotation of dewormers. The licensee stated they will give different dewormers at different times of
the year, and they will generally use the dosing instructions given on the label. The labels for one bottle of Panacur and
one bottle of Ivermec only contain dosage instructions for horses, cattle, or swine. The written program of veterinary care
does not provide any specific schedule, screening, or indication for deworming, nor does it contain dosing or rotation
instructions for the species maintained at the facility. Improper use of dewormers in certain species can be dangerous
(toxic) or can lead to parasite resistance. Lacking these explicit instructions (dose, frequency/schedule, and rotation of
products) does not assure the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to oversee this aspect of animal care.
Additionally, facility personnel have performed surgical procedures (anal sacculectomy) on skunks in the past (none since
last inspection). The facility’s current written protocol is missing the following pieces of information:
- How specifically to perform the anal sac removal (step by step)
- Post-procedural care instructions
- Pain control measures


Performing surgical procedures without proper oversight or guidance from a licensed veterinarian can cause unnecessary
harm, pain or injury to the animal and can be detrimental to the animal’s health and wellbeing. Correct by ensuring the
attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to oversee the provision of adequate veterinary care and have direct
knowledge of all aspects of animal care, to include all medications to be given and procedures performed.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility does not currently have an inventory of animals on hand nor acquisition records for animals acquired since the
last inspection. However, records of disposition were made available that correctly account for the numbers of animals
seen today as compared with the last inspection. Improper record keeping does not allow for a complete inspection of the
facility and does not facilitate proper tracking of animals during a disease outbreak. Complete acquisition and disposition
records containing all information required by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations are necessary to be able to accurately
track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, age of the animals, and
humane transportation. This requirement applies to all regulated animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held,
leased or otherwise in possession of or under control of the licensee, including any offspring born of any animal while that
animal is in his or her possession or under his or her control, and all regulated animals transported, sold, euthanized, or
otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.
3.127(d) Critical Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
This facility does not currently have a perimeter fence. The licensee had previously obtained a perimeter fence variance
for some of the species at the facility in 2012. However, there have been several changes to the overall facility and animal
inventory that were not covered under the previous variance approval in 2012. The facility’s request for a new variance
has been denied, and the previously approved variance has been revoked by APHIS Administration. As a result of this


lack of perimeter fence, the licensee has lost 2 arctic fox that escaped their enclosure when a tree fell on the box and
damaged the box. The licensee could not locate the two arctic fox when he discovered the damage from the fallen tree,
and has not seen them since.

The lack of a perimeter fence does not allow for a secondary form of containment in the event of an escape of dangerous
or exotic species. In addition, there are no physical barriers in place that would prevent unwanted animals or people from
walking directly up to an enclosure and making contact with the animals contained therein. The licensee must ensure a
perimeter fence is properly in place or apply and receive approval for a variance from the Administrator for all species that
require a perimeter fence.
3.129(b) Repeat

Feeding.
Approximately 20% of the food receptacles for the fox, raccoons, skunks, ferrets, and mink in the facility have an
excessive amount of rust or have buildup/deposits of old food present on them. Many of the food receptacles do not have
a top or cover that prevents rain from getting into the food. Rust and organic buildup prevents the food receptacles from
being properly cleaned and sanitized and may contaminate fresh food being deposited into these receptacles, which
exposes animals to disease hazards. Correct by ensuring all food receptacles are kept clean and sanitary or are replaced
if necessary, and measures are taken to prevent molding, contamination (including by rainwater), and deterioration or
caking of food.
3.130 Repeat

Watering.
Roughly 40 of the water receptacles for the fox, raccoon, groundhogs, and skunk (comprising about 35% of the total
number of water receptacles for these species) and all of those for ferret and mink have chew or scratch damage, or have


accumulated layers of calcium or organic deposits (including algae) that do not allow for proper cleaning or sanitation.
Although this percentage has risen compared to that observed at the last inspection, the overall number of animals has
been reduced so the actual number of waterers observed with these changes is about the same. These waterers have
deposits of brown, red, or black material embedded into the scratch marks or chewed areas. Having water receptacles
that are not properly cleaned and sanitized expose the animals to unnecessary hazards or can adversely affect the flavor
and thus the animals’ willingness to actually drink the water. Correct by ensuring all water receptacles are kept clean and
sanitary.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
