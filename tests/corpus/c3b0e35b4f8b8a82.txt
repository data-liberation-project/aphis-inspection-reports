***Bear Perimeter Fence: The perimeter fence around the bear enclosure is damaged from a fallen tree. One
section of the chain link fence is sagging to the point that that the structural strength of the fence is compromised.
The top fence support poles were bent and some have been removed. A perimeter fence must be constructed in a
manner that protects the animals and prevents entry of unauthorized person and unwanted animals. The perimeter
fence must be repaired to maintain the integrity of the fence and to ensure the unwanted animals and persons do
not come in direct with the bear. Correct by April 30, 2016.
