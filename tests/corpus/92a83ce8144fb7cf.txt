ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The written program of veterinary care stipulates an inspection frequency of no more than twelve months. The
last visit to this site by the attending veterinarian documented was during December, 2012, approximately 15
months ago. The attending veterinarian must make a site visit as specified in the program of veterinary care to
examine the dogs and review the program of vet care. It was also noted during this inspection that the most current
program of veterinary care did not fully document the vaccination protocol for either adult or juvenile canines.
These areas were not completed on the program. The sections pertaining to emergency care and euthanasia
contained only a reference to another veterinarian that is not the current attending vet. An adequate program of
veterinary care must contain proper instructions for contacts for emergency purposes as well as appropriate
euthanasia methods. These sections should be reviewed with the attending veterinarian and corrected or updated
as applicable. To be corrected by: 04/19/14
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
*** Two enclosures were observed containing weaned puppies without proper identification. One enclosure
contained two Yorkshire Terrier puppies with one Rat Terrier puppy and another contained two Rat Terrier puppies.
None of the puppies had ID tags or collars, no microchips were present and no cage cards were posted with
identification information. All puppies must be properly identified with either tags, collars, microchips or when
applicable cards on the enclosure to ensure adquate record keeping and proper treatment. To be corrected by:

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***The first enclosure, containing three Rat Terriers, on the west side of the large kennel shed had multiple deposits
of fecal waste on the south end of the enclosure. The amount of feces in this area made it difficult for the dogs to
walk through this area without contacting fecal waste. Per the owner the enclosure had not been spotcleaned in at
least two days. This enclosure must be thoroughly cleaned with all feces removed. All enclosures must be spot
cleaned daily with all feces removed from the kennel area far enough to reduce odors, pests and disease hazards. To be corrected by: 03/19/14
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
