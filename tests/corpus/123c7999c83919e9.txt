ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1040 on
23-May-17.
Upon arrival at the facility contact was made with the housekeeper. She stated that the licensee was not home and
that she did not know when she would return. Next I called the licensee's contact number, left a message and
waited for 30 minutes.
