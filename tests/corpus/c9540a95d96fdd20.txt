ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The inventory for the some of the animals (cervid hoof stock) were not available at the time of the inspection. Lack
of records does not allow APHIS Officials to track animals as necessary. Ensure copies of inventory records are
available during business hours for review. Correct from this time forward.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The common fencing for the primary enclosure of 2 pigs and 6 white-tailed deer is loose enough for the pigs to get
under and exit their enclosure into the deer enclosure. The pig enclosure is not structurally sound enough to contain
the pigs within their enclosure and the pigs could become injured. Repair the fencing of the enclosure to ensure
that it contains the pigs and prevents the possibility of injury. Corrected at the time of inspection.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with Facility Representative and this Veterinary Medical Officer.
