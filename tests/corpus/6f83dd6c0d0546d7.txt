2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Two dogs and two cats have been acquired since the last inspection. A 6-month-old Husky dog was acquired about 4
months ago; a 4-month-old Poodle was acquired about 2 months ago; and two 5-month-old DSH cats were acquired
about 3 months ago. None of these animals and their information had been added to the licensee’s Record of Acquisition
of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005). Also, at the time of the inspection, the licensee did not have the name
and address of the person from whom the cats were acquired. Complete acquisition information is necessary for trace-
backs and for identification purposes. The licensee must ensure that their form 7005 is kept up-to-date and must obtain
the name and address of their animal sources at the time of acquisition.
To be corrected by September 25, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
