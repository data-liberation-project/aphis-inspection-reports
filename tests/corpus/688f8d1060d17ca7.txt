Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The metal, collapsible crate used to transport the two Patagonian cavies does not have projecting rims or handholds.
Transport enclosures lacking projecting rims or other devices (at least .75 inch) could potentially allow obstruction of
enclosure ventilation openings. Transport enclosures lacking handholds or other devices for lifting do not assure the
person handling the enclosure will not be in contact with the animals. Assure the Patagonian cavies are transported in
enclosures with projecting rims (at least .75 inches) and handholds or other devices.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 6-17-22 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
