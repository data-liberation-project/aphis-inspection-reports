ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There is no formal agreement with an attending veterinarian and therefore there is no written program of
veterinary care. Formal arrangements shall be made with a local veterinarian who will provide adequate veterinary
care to the animals and guidance to personnel involved in the care of the animals. The arrangements shall include

***The older male camel (uncertain of exact age as no records are available for review) appears very thin. The ribs
are easily seen through his coat, the flank area is sunken and the pelvic ridges are prominent. The owner indicates
the camels are dewormed on a routine basis and he dewormed them about 6 weeks ago. Their are no records to
determine when the camels were last examined by the veterinarian and the owners states they have not been
examined recently. The camel shall be examined by the veterinarian to determine current health status and to
ensure appropriate treatment is provided accordingly. Documentation of evaluation, treatment and
recommendations shall be maintained for future review by APHIS Officials during inspection.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***There are no records concerning animals on hand available for review. All records of acquisition of animals
purchased or otherwise acquired (donations, transfers, born on premises), and disposition (sales, deaths, donations
transfers, etc) shall be maintained and made accessible for review during inspection. Correct by February 25, 2017.
3.125(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The shade roof provided for the camels has been knocked down and is leaning on the fence. The broken
structure and pieces of wood are a safety hazard which may allow the camels to become injured. The structure and
broken wood shall be removed or repaired to protect the camels from injury.
***The shelter structure in the camel enclosure is in disrepair. The wall of the shelter is/was covered on the bottom
half by a panel of wood approximately 4 feet high. The camels have chewed on it, kicked it, and broken it leaving
wood pieces and a panel on the ground around the shelter. The corners of the tin roof have been bent and ripped
leaving sharp edges at a level accessible to the camels which may allow the camels to become injured. The shelter
shall be repaired, all sharp edges and broken wood removed from the enclosure to protect the camels from injury.
***In the camel enclosure the top cross bar on one section of the back fence was damaged by a fallen tree. The bar
is bent in and detached from the fence post. It no longer secures the top of the chain-link fence weakening the
fences structural strength. The fence shall be repaired to protect the camels and contain them securely within their
enclosure.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***With the recent rains the majority of the camel enclosure is very muddy and has several large areas of standing
water. I observed the camels feet sinking deep into the mud while walking. It is not currently possible for the
camels to access their water and feed without walking through the mud and water. The slippery mud and standing
water present safety and health hazards that may allow the camels to become injured or develop foot diseases and
lameness. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water to prevent the camels from being
subjected to these conditions and protect their health and well-being.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The camel shelter has three sides open with a half wall on the fourth side. This is insufficient protection from the
wind and cold. Exposure to inclement weather for an extended period of time may cause discomfort and increase
the risk of illness. The shelter shall be constructed to afford adequate protection from inclement weather and
provide comfort for the camels. Correct by March 1, 2017.
