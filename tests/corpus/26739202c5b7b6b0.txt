Facilities, general.
In the sheep, goat, and alpaca enclosure, there are several areas of fencing in a state of disrepair. The fence between the
two main shelters has an area of metal paneling that has become partially trampled down into the ground. Several fence
posts between this enclosure and the adjacent horse pastures have fallen to the ground and have caused the fence lines
to also lie on the ground or partially suspended. These areas of down fences have allowed the sheep and goats to enter
the adjacent horse barn and pasture areas.
Failure to maintain enclosure fencing can allow for gaps, unstable structures, or loose fencing wires which can result in
injury, entrapment, or escape of the animals.
Facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them. The owner stated that
new fencing has been purchased, but he is currently waiting for the product to be shipped to the facility.

The facility inspection was conducted with a facility representative. The record review and exit were conducted with the
owner.
