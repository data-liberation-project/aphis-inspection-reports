3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125(a) Structural Strength.
The fence along the front of the enclosure housing 2 adult Elk is pulled upward along the bottom. The pulled up
fence has broken, ripped wires with sharp edges protruding towards the animal that could potentially cause injuries
and is not in good repair. Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound, in good repair to
contain and protect the animals from injuries.
One 9 month old male Red Fox named "Rascal" that was acquired from Wyoming Fish and Wildlife on 1/16/2015
escaped from his enclosure on 3/18/2015. Traps had been put out to re-capture the animal, but the animal was
never found. Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound, in good repair to contain and
protect the animal.
This is a repeat non-compliant item from an inspection that was conducted on 1/6/2015 with original correction date
of 1/16/2015 and 3/2/2015.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125 (c) Storage. In the commissary on the top of the refrigerator is an open box of dog milk bones sitting next to 2
spray bottles of insecticides which could potentially contaminate the animal diet. The refrigerator located in the
storage area has packages of rotting apples sitting on the shelves. Along the inside of the refrigerator door, there
are individual apples sitting on red sticky liquid. The red sticky liquid ran down the entire length of the interior door
panel. The rotting and contaminated produce could potentially have been fed to the animals. Supplies of food shall
be stored in facilities so that it is protected from deterioration, molding and contamination.To be corrected by: 6/30/2015

SANITATION.
3.131 (c) Housekeeping. In the commissary building cleaning products are being stored next to animal diet.
Excess items (i.e. empty jars, card board tubes, fish food, can cat food, tools, binders etc.) are being stored in the
cupboards, along the top and side shelves not allowing adequate cleaning. Along the baseboard next to the chest
freezer is food, debris and one of the card board tubes lying on the floor. Accumulation of the empty plastic food
containers and discarded produce is not being cleared away as often as necessary to facilitate adequate cleaning
and sanitation. All building and grounds shall be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate proper husbandry
practices.
