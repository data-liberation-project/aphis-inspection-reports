ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:45 PM on
20-Nov-19.
Knocked on the door, yelled hello out towards the kennel, called phone and left a message, honked the car horn, an
individual that was doing work at the address tried to contact the licensee by phone but no answer.
