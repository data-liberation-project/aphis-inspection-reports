FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The meat cooler had an overwhelming odor of rotten and decaying meat. This odor is noticeable from a distance of
several feet from outside the cooler with the door closed. This odor makes it very hard to determine if the meat
items stored in this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the cooler, identify the source of the odor and
eliminate it.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Deteriorating and softening bell peppers, discolored and softening
oranges, spoiled lettuce and deteriorating celery were present in the cooler. This produce was stored on the
already sorted (feed side of the cooler). Spoiled produce must be removed promptly to prevent contamination of
food intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce promptly. This cooler needs to be
cleaned and have spoiled and deteriorating items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will
be fed to the animals. The facility management claims to be sorting the produce again before feeding but the
deteriorating and rotten condition of the produce present in the American black bear food receptacle box makes it
impossible for APHIS inspectors to determine if this is true.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle box for the enclosure housing two American black bears contained a large amount of rotting
food debris both in and near it. Any food fed in this area is going to be contaminated by the rotting material present.
These feeders need to be cleaned and made sanitary to ensure that the food fed to the bears is wholesome and
free from bacterial or pest infestation which could result in health issues for the bears.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the tiger known as Daisy had a large amount of algae slime lining
its interior. The water was green in appearance. The water receptacle for the Syrian Brown bear enclosure
contained ice, dirt, a bone and a small amount of muddy water. The bear pool indicated by facility management as
being the bears alternative source of water contained ice and dirty, discolored water. These water receptacles arenot being cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis. Water receptacles should be kept clean and sanitary to
promote adequate water consumption which is essential for animal health. Clean and sanitize these water
receptacles more frequently. At the time of the inspection of the Syrian brown bear water receptacle, facility
management did comment that "It was winter time and beggars can't be choosers." It is this nonchalant and
indifferent attitude by management towards animal husbandry that directly results in all the poor husbandry
conditions for the animals at this facility.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive feces in the tiger known as Lilly's enclosure. There is excessive food waste and rotting
produce near the food receptacle and in the American black bear enclosure. There is excessive bones in the
enclosure for the grizzly bear. There is excessive feces and bones in the Asian black bear enclosure. The Asian
black bear den floor is just bare dirt and bones. The Syrian brown bear enclosure contains excessive bones. There
was a rotten odor in the cougar den box and a piece of rotting cow hide was present in the enclosure. These
enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis. This rotting material and feces can lead to pest control
issues. With warmer weather coming to the area quite soon these odor and pest control issues will be exacerbated.
The rotting material present in the bear enclosure can contaminate them as they lie in their enclosure. These
animals can ingest this material when they groom. Not removing old food waste promptly can lead to contamination
of new food. Ingesting this rotten material can lead to potential health problems. Clean these enclosures more
frequently to prevent a buildup of food and fecal waste to minimize odors and prevent potential health problems for
the animals housed in them.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Although there is now some evidence of clean up, a large portion of the premises is filled with various debris, old
equipment, boards, trash and fence. Several other buildings on the property are also filled with old equipment and
debris and trash. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and numerous rodent holes
were located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were located in the alleyway for theleopard row cat enclosures. Rodent holes were noted going under the shelter for the cougar enclosure and in the
cougar enclosure. Rodent holes were noted near and in the enclosure for the tiger known as Mohan. Rodent holes
were seen in the vacant enclosure next to Mohan. Rodent holes were noted near the Asian black bear enclosure.
Rodents can be carriers of disease which may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective
means of rodent control must be established for the facility.
3.132 CRITICAL REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that despite the reduction in animal numbers that there is a lack of adequately trained employees. The
persistence of multiple animal welfare act violations related to basic animal husbandry issues illustrates this point.
The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can result in facility and animal
conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Of special concern on this inspection was the attitude of a
member of facility management. In referring to the extremely dirty water receptacle in use in the Syrian brown bear
enclosure she stated, "It is winter and beggars can't be choosers." It is this indifference to the basic animal
husbandry needs of animals housed at this facility that leads to the poor conditions at the facility. This facility states
that it is an animal sanctuary. This member of facility management demonstrates a very indifferent attitude towards
animal welfare at the facility. This leads to a culture of indifference at this facility to basic animal needs and
treatment. This is animal cruelty. It is this culture of indifference to basic needs of animals that puts all animals at
the facility in danger. Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be added.
The inspection was conducted with facility management and a volunteer worker. An informal exit interview was
conducted with the CEO at the conclusion of the inspection. All non-compliant items were discussed. A formal exit
interview was conducted with the CEO on 3-22-17.
The condition of the tiger known as Daisy is currently under review by APHIS officials.
