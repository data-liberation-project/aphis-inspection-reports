OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(d) Perimeter fence.
***** At time of inspection the enclosures for the two groups of Lemurs did not have a perimeter fence of at least 6'
in height.
A perimeter fence needs to be constructed for these two groups that will protect the nonhuman primates by
restricting unauthorized humans, and animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through it or under
it and having contact with the nonhuman primates.
This fence should be of sufficient distance to prevent contact between the animals inside the fence and outside the
fence. Less than 3' ft. in distance must be approved by the Administrator.
This fence will help to ensure the saftey and health of both the public and animals from becoming at risk by direct
contact between those animals inside the enclosures and those animals and humans outside the enclosure.
