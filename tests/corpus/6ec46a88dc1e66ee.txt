2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
Facility staff didn’t handle a rabbit as carefully as possible when they failed to secure the inside/outside access door in the
rabbit enclosure on or around the evening if 12/28/21. As per the facility representative, a female Netherland dwarf rabbit
was able to gain access to the outdoor area of the enclosure after the inside/outside access door was thought to be
secured. While the rabbit was outside, the door was shut due to winds and the animal was unable to go back to the
inside area of the enclosure as per the facility representative. The rabbit was discovered deceased on the following day.
Ensure proper handling methods of rabbits are in place to prevent physical harm of animals.
Note: The facility has implemented multiple processes and changed the door latch to prevent future incidents.
