ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee does not have a written program of veterinary care and although he has veterinarians who can provide
services for the animals when contacted they do not make regularly scheduled visits to the facility. Each exhibitor
shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements to ensure that adequate veterinary can be
provided to the animals on the premises. Formal arrangements with a part time or consulting veterinarian must
include a written program of veterinary care for all species that reflects veterinary, husbandry, handling and dietary
practices at the facility and regularly scheduled visits by the veterinarian often enough to provide appropriate
oversight of the care and use of the animals.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following animals identified during this inspection were exhibiting symptoms indicative of compromised health
and must be examined by a veterinarian, a diagnosis obtained and appropriate treatment rendered:
*A mature aoudad ram was unable to use either front foot/leg in a normal manner when walking and the front
hooves appear to be overgrown. The animal was seen ambulating on the knees and when attempting to weight
bear on the front feet an obviously abnormal, exaggerated gait and weight shifting was apparent. The licensee
stated that the ram’s difficulty walking was first identified about a week ago. Abnormal postures and gaits can
indicate a serious, painful problem with the feet.
*A mature beefalo cow, possibly older than 20 years, was dorsally recumbant in an open pasture. The cow’s right
eye globe was opaque and white. The animal exhibited a low body condition score with pin and hook bones visible,
prominent spine, some visible ribs and scarce body fat. Respiratory rate appeared rapid. Facility staff tried to
encourage the animal to her feet but were not able to get her in a standing position. Inability to stand may indicate a
serious health condition due to infection, parasites, metabolic compromise or injury.
*A mature Watusi bull, “Steve” exhibits a continuous dramatic head tilt or torticollis to the left side. The licensee
stated the condition has been present for several years and is undiagnosed. Steve also has a copious mucous
discharge dripping from the left nostril. The Watusi bull “Goliath” also has a slight head tilt or torticollis to the right
side. Head tilt and torticollis can be indicative of infectious or non-infectious disease processes or trauma and may
cause discomfort to the animal.*A mature female dromedary camel “Cleo” who is possibly older than 20 years, was dorsally recumbent in an open
pasture. Facility staff were requested to encourage Cleo to stand and were successful. However, the camel was
slow to rise, appeared stiff, inflexible and reluctant to walk. Compromised ability to stand or walk can indicate pain,
weakness or discomfort.
*A mature female waterbuck was noted to be very thin with prominent hook and pin bones, visible ribs, minimal
muscle tone and body fat. The licensee stated the animal’s poor body condition was identified a week ago but no
treatment had been provided because the animal couldn’t be captured or restrained. Poor body condition can be
indicative of parasites, disease or other conditions that adversely affect animal health and well-being.
*The black and white domestic cow has an obvious lump or swelling under the skin on the right side mid-body just
below the spine. An abnormal swelling could be caused by infection, trauma or disease processes and may be
painful or harmful to the health of the animal.
2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee stated during this inspection that the aoudad’s gait abnormalities and the waterbuck’s poor body
condition were identified approximately a week ago. However, these problems related to animal health and
well-being were not communicated to an attending veterinarian and have remained unaddressed. The information
obtained from daily observations of the animals by facility personnel must be relayed accurately and frequently
enough to the attending veterinarian so that guidance and treatment of health problems can be given and adequate
veterinary care can be provided.
2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Two Camels were recently purchased and transported to the facility. However, no record of acquisition, or any
other written documents stating where the animals were purchased from could be presented to the inspectors.
The licensee claims to have over 400 animals on his facility grounds. However, no record of animals on hand could
be presented to the inspectors verifying this.
Records of animals on hand, acquisition, disposition, and transportation of all animals that come go or reside in the
facility grounds is essential and necessary in order to properly track the animals whereabouts at any given time.
The licensee must develop a record of all mammals exhibited on the facility grounds and ensure that it is kept up to
date as needed when animals are born, expire, or are bought, sold or otherwise transferred on or off of the facility
grounds.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There are no barrier fences for the wallaby, javelina, watusi, cavy, and muntjac. The only attendants available were
preoccupied with the pony rides, in which at that time school aged kids were allowed to freely stick their fingers
inside the Javelina enclosure. This facility does not have an effective barrier that prevented the public from reaching
the animals. During public exhibition, any animal must be handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between
the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All the lemur enclosures are in disrepair. The outer bottom edges are rotted on all the shelters. The platform wood
boards are rotted and warping. Nails have come undone underneath the shelter. The lemur enclosure located in
the back pasture next to the camels, one support post for the shelter has rotted through where it meets the water.
All housing facilities must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Currently all the lemur enclosures are not being cleaned appropriately and there is no access to the inside of the
lemur enclosure that is next to the camels. The ladder is broken and does not allow for employees to properly
access and clean out the old debris from inside and around the shelter. The licensee and an employee stated they
only put bedding in once a year by throwing it on top of the platform and using a rake to push the straw inside the
shelter. There is a buildup of debris coming out of the rotted edges of the shelter. An algae buildup has formed on
the rotted platform boards. Surfaces must be constructed in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and
sanitized or replaced when worn. The surfaces for the non-human primates need to be addressed to facilitate
cleaning for their heath. Hard surfaces the non-human primates come into contact with must be spot cleaned daily
and sanitized in accordance with section 3.84.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.The licensee does not have a written primate enrichment program for an individually housed ring-tail lemur at the
facility. To ensure adequate provisions are in place to promote the psychological well-being of non-human primate
at the facility an enrichment plan must be developed, documented, followed and approved by the attending
veterinarian. Special considerations must be included in the plan for individually housed non-human primates that
are unable to see or hear other non-human primates of their own or compatible species.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Currently there is no non-human primate enrichment plan at this facility for the lemurs. An environment
enhancement plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards and should meet the
needs of all nonhuman primates at their facility. This plan needs to be evaluated and signed by the attending
veterinarian and made available to APHIS upon request. This plan is important for promoting the psychological
well-being of nonhuman primates, and must address social needs, environmental enrichment, and any special
considerations.

WATERING.
All the lemurs are located on islands surrounded by a pond, which is the only source of drinking water for the
lemurs. The water is very dirty with algae floating on the top. Potable water must be provided to all non-human
primates at this facility or offered as often as necessary to ensure their health, but no less than twice daily for at
least 1 hour each time.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility grounds are surrounded by a barrier made up of a mixture of a thick density steel type fencing, what the
licensee called pig wire, and cattle panels. In multiple areas throughout the facility, sections of this fencing were
excessively rusted, corroded to the point that there were small gaps noticed in some areas, and damage causing
sharp and twisted points in the fencing.
In the Giraffe enclosure, there was a large wooden support beam made to hold the enclosure fencing up that was
bent and loose. In the same area, damage to the fencing was causing sharp and rusted points to be exposed. Thelarge male Giraffe was observed putting his head over this section of fencing, laying his neck over the section with
sharp points. In the indoor section of the Giraffe enclosure, the metal cattle panels making up the front of the
enclosure were pocked and discolored, and flaked when one inspector picked at it. The licensee stated that it was
rust build up. In the same enclosure, there was a galvanized metal fencing piece towards the rear of the indoor
section that had been damaged and had a long straight piece of sharp wire exposed towards the enclosure where a
juvenile and pregnant female giraffe resided.
The enclosure holding at least two Axis Deer contained sections of fencing that was excessively rusted. The
outdoor shelter provided to the Axis Deer was damaged, containing a large section of one wall that was missing.
The tin type building used as a shelter for a Rhinoceros and multiple Aoudad had excessive rust and corrosion
buildup towards the bottom of the back of the enclosure causing several small gaps in the wall. At least one of the
large metal panels used to enclose the Rhino was corroded to the extent that pocking and a hole was observed in a
section by the water trough.
The American Buffalo enclosure contained several areas of fencing that were excessively rusted or damaged,
exposing bunched up and/or sharp points.
The hay barn, which also has a shelter built out of each side of the barn, contained walls and ceilings that were
excessively rusted. Support beams on the ceiling were corroded to such an extent that the inspectors could see
through them. Some panels on the back walls were separating and folding out, causing sharp surfaces near
feeding troughs. Sharp, rusted nail heads were observed in this same area, near feeding troughs.
In the enclosure housing two javalinas, a portion of wire mesh had come apart and was hanging down several feet
into the enclosure. Other sections of the enclosure fencing were bowing down into the enclosure.
A cattle panel type door where four camels were during the inspection was broken and in disrepair, causing sharp
and rough points to protrude out.
In the Patagonian cavy enclosure, a hole approximately one foot by two feet in diameter and an undetermined depth
was observed on the ground. Exposed fencing material could be seen in the hole which was full of water. A section
of the front of the enclosure was excessively rusted.
The enclosure containing two Watusi and two cows contained sections of damaged and rusted fencing.
The enclosure containing at least one wallaby contained sections of damage and excessive rust. The shelter inside
the enclosure was made of wood and was cracked and bowing outward, separating from the frame.
An open enclosure beside the Kangaroo enclosure, which most animals in the facility have access to, contained awooden shelter that was bowed and warped, beginning to separate from the frame. The same enclosure contained
areas of excessive rust and damage causing sharp points to be exposed.
Fencing and shelters in disrepair can cause animals within to become injured and poses hazards including but not
limited to injury, animals escaping or unwanted animals entering enclosures. The licensee must repair, replace, or
discontinue using these areas to enclose animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the hoof stock feed room inside the main barn a large black trashcan full of feed pellets was uncovered, exposing
the feed. In the same room, a hole in the wall that appeared to be indicative of rodent activity was observed.
In the secondary feed room in the main barn where rabbit pellets and primate biscuits are stored, the floor was
observed to have a layer of brownish tan, organic material and feed bag waste covering it. At least two large
cockroaches were observed in this room. One bag of rabbit pellets was open and uncovered, exposing several
inches of pellets.
The large hay barn by the Alligator enclosure contained hay that appeared to be soiled and in some sections,
moldy. The licensee stated that some of the hay is fed to the animals.
Exposed feed can become contaminated by insects, vermin and bacteria, causing a hazard to any animals that may
come in contact with it. Food must be kept in sealed containers and away from vermin, insects and the elements in
order to remain fresh and wholesome.

3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In several areas throughout the complex, there were areas in excess of ten feet wide and up to several feet thick of
what appeared to be excreta and used hay. Animals had access to these areas.
Excreta, rubbish, and used bedding that is not properly disposed of in a timely manner can soil the animals, and
attract insects and vermin to the area. Areas within the complex must remain clean and free of excess waste. Correct by 8/20/2017
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The entire facility ground is surrounded by a perimeter fence. However, a majority of the hoofstock animals have
free range access within the complex and are not enclosed in any type of pen causing the complex fence to act as a
large single enclosure without any sort of perimeter fence or secondary containment.
The licensee stated that the perimeter fence is approximately 7.5 feet tall. One rhinoceros at the facility requires a
perimeter fence at least 8 feet fall.
An appropriate perimeter fence is required to prevent public contact with the animal and to serve as secondary
containment. Perimeter fences less than 6 feet high or less than 8 feet high for dangerous animals, such as the
rhino, must be approved in writing by the Administrator and the facility needs to send in a variance request for this.
Applicant will submit a variance request for this.

3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Though food receptacles were seen in several of the enclosures, the following enclosures contained animal feed
and vegetables that appeared to have been dropped onto the ground inside the enclosures instead of being placed
into sanitized receptacles: Javalinas, Kangaroo, Wallaby, Muntjac, Axis Deer, White Tailed Deer. Flies and mud
were observed on several of these piles of feed and vegetables. Contamination of food by animal waste, insects or
vermin can cause animals who ingest it to become ill. Food must be given to animals in sanitized receptacles.

WATERING.
The licensee stated that the animals in the complex drink from the various ponds and streams on the property. No
fresh, clean water is provided. Many of the ponds contained a complete surface cover of green organic matter.
Excreta was seen close to many of these bodies of water and vermin such as snakes and rats were noted in and
around many of these bodies of water.
Some water receptacles and troughs were observed throughout the complex. The Rhino is provided a trough of
water since no natural body of water exists in his enclosure. The inspectors could not see through the water andthe licensee stated it is emptied and cleaned once a year. Several troughs of water including but not limited to one
by the hay barn had insect larva swimming in it. Several natural bodies of water also had an excessive amount of
insect larva and small flying insects in and around the water.
Animals are susceptible to parasites and can become ill from contaminated or unclean water. Animals must be
provided clean fresh water in sanitized receptacles.

SANITATION.
Shelters inside enclosures containing the following animals: Rhino, Camels, Aoudad, Kangaroo, Wallaby,
Patagonian Cavy, Muntjac, Axis Deer, and the enclosure beside the Kangaroo enclosure that was open with access
by many species of animals, all had an excess amount of excreta and hay in them ranging from several inches to
several feet thick. The licensee informed the inspectors that some of these enclosures get cleaned out once a year.
Inadequate cleaning practices draw insects and vermin to the area, can soil the animals and contaminate food and
water supplies, and cause overall unhealthy conditions for the animals within. Enclosures must be cleaned as often
as necessary to ensure no excessive buildup of waste material accumulates.
Correct by 8/20/2017
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
No formal pest control program could be presented to the inspectors. During the inspection, Roaches were noted in
the feed room, as well as signs of rodents present in the same area. A rat and a snake were observed in an area
where ring tailed lemurs were present. Living insect larva was seen in several of the water troughs. All of the
ponds currently used as water supplies contained a variety of insects, larva, reptiles and vermin. The licensee also
stated there is a problem at the facility with buzzards.
Without a formal and active pest control program, there is a serious health and safety risk to the animals, and risk of
contamination to food and water stores. The licensee must develop and execute a pest control plan throughout the
facility in order to attempt to mitigate the above mentioned problems.
Correct by 8/28/2017
3.132EMPLOYEES.
During the inspection, one of the inspectors witnessed two children approach the Javalina enclosure and stick their
fingers through the enclosure fencing. When an employee was asked where the area attendant was, the inspector
was told that the single employee running the pony rides also watched the area and that it was up to the adults who
bring children to the facility to watch their children. With out an adequate number of employees, there is a
significant health and safety risk for both the animals and public. The licensee must ensure that areas with public
access be attended by an adequate number of knowledgeable employees to ensure that the animals remain
secured and unmolested in their enclosures.
