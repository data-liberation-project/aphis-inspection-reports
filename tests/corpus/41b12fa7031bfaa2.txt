3.75(b)

Housing facilities, general.
At the time of the inspection, the animal areas inside the main building had an accumulation of items behind the animal
enclosures and on the sides that make the area cluttered and difficult to clean. This includes extra crates stacked on the
wall, a bale of hay, a bird bath and oval mirror that is cracked, a bag of stuffed animals, newspaper supplies for bedding
and a large bag of miscellaneous potato chips. In addition, a food storage container next to the sink, had food enrichment
items stored along with bubble solution and flea and tick shampoo. This animal area must be kept clean and free of clutter
to facilitate cleaning around the site, reduce living areas for pests and protect food supplies from contamination.
