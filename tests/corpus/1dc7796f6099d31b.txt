On 17-Mar-2021 LOT Polish Airlines transported a dog, according to accompanying health records was born 20-Nov-
2020, to NYC JFK airport on AWB 080-35549791. Upon arrival into JFK the dog was found deceased. An examination of
the transport kennel showed ventilation openings totaling 20% with 33% of the front, 9% of both side walls, and 16% of
the back wall consisting of openings. The front and back side of the kennel were flat and did not have projecting rims.
The lack of projecting rims on those sides created an enclosure with functionally inadequate ventilation had other cargo
been stacked against it. Projecting rims or similar devices must be located on the exterior of each enclosure wall having a
ventilation opening to prevent obstruction of the openings.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
