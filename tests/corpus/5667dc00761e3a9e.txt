Grizzly Bear enclosure: An approximate 3 foot long section of the bear(cid:25)'s holding area building had exposed
insulation material at the junction of the roof and a side wall panel of the building. The location of the insulation is
accessible to the bears and may pose a health risk. A system of timely identification, repair and maintenance of
facilities must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
