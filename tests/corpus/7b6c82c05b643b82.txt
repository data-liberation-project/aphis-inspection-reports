3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are two outdoor enclosures (each housing 4 dogs) that have a shelter structure that is too small for the dogs
in that enclosure. Dogs that do not have access to shelter structures in outdoor enclosures might not be protected
adequately from the elements. The licensee must ensure that outdoor enclosures include one or more shelter
structures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each
animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. This was corrected
during the inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is a metal welded wire fence panel with exposed points along its length protruding into the exercise yard.
There is also a metal wire "tie" securing the fence to a post in the same enclosure. The ends of this metal "tie" are
exposed and extending into the enclosure. Exposed metal points can cause injury to the dogs. The licensee must
ensure that primary enclosures be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that
could injure the dogs and cats. This was corrected during the inspection.
3.6(b)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are 5 primary enclosures that do not have adequate elevated resting surfaces to accommodate all the cats in
the enclosure. The use of elevated resting surfaces satisfies a behavioral preference for many cats. The licensee
must ensure that each primary enclosure housing cats must contain a resting surface or surfaces that, in the
aggregate, are large enough to hold all the occupants of the primary enclosure at the same time comfortably. The
resting surfaces must be elevated, impervious to moisture, and be able to be easily cleaned and sanitized, or easily
replaced when soiled or worn. This was corrected during the inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
