2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
According to a facility representative, in September 2017 a new attending veterinarian (AV) had been obtained for
this facility. The new AV has not performed a site visit and has not completed a new written program of veterinary
care (PVC). The written PVC should contain enough detail to reflect what is actually being conducted on the
premises. Routine preventative medications and other routine approved treatments that the veterinarian has
authorized must be included in sufficient detail to ensure that adequate veterinary care is being provided and that it
is at the direction of the new attending veterinarian. The lack of details on preventatives and/or treatments could
lead to inadequate veterinary care.
The attending veterinarian needs to be employed under formal arrangements with a written program of veterinary
care and needs to conduct regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
