ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In April 2016, the licensee noticed the tip of the coatimudi tail was hairless and swollen. However, a consultation
with the veterinarian did not occur. The animal was examined by a veterinarian on May 7, 2016 and diagnosed with
lice and prescribed an appropriate treatment which the licensee administered. Examination and treatment for the
coatimundi was delayed for at least three (3) weeks and communication with the veterinarian did not occur when
injury was first noticed. Direct and frequent contact with the attending veterinarian must occur to ensure animals are
properly diagnosed and receive treatment for illnesses, injury, or disease in a timely manner. Practices must be
established to ensure the attending veterinarian is contacted when an animal is noted as having an injury or illness.
Additionally, the veterinarian should be consulted regarding preventative measures for controlling lice. Correct by
July 15, 2016
NOTE: At the time of inspection hair had grown back on most of the tip of the tail and the skin was not swollen or
ulcerated.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General
*** The openings on the floor of the cage housing three (3) guinea pigs has 1/2 x 1 1/2 inch openings. The guinea
pigs feet can pass through the openings, which could lead to injury. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a
manner that protects the feet and legs from injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be modified to reduce the
size of the openings to prevent the feet of the guinea pigs from passing through. Correct by July 15, 2016
3.53(a)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General***The floor of the rabbit cage has 1x1 inch openings. The feet of the chocolate satin rabbit housed in this cage can
pass through easily. Wooden boards have been placed in the cage, however it does not cover the entire cage floor.
The rabbit at times prefer to rest and walk on the slated floor. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner
that protects the feet and legs from injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be modified to reduce the size of
the openings to prevent the feet of the rabbit from passing through. Correct by July 15, 2016.
3.56(a)
SANITATION.
Cleaning
*** There is a build-up of rabbit fur and urine along the back leg of each of the cages. There is also an excessive
amount of rabbit feces under and around the cages. Rabbit cages should be kept reasonably free of feces and fur to
facilitate the pest control program and to prevent exposure of the animals to potential disease. The cages must be
thoroughly cleaned and the feces and fur must be removed and disposed of properly to ensure animals are in a
clean environment and not exposed to vermin or other disease hazards. A schedule of cleaning must be established
that will prevent excessive build- up of feces and fur. Correct by July 13, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
***Bear enclosure (catch area and den): The bear enclosure is in need of repair, specifically the den and catch area.
The gate for the catch area appears to be held together by chains and locks, although one side of the gate has
metal hinge attachments at the top and bottom. The catch area latch is secured with a large metal clip that can be
easily opened by a person. An appropriate lock must be used to secure the gate to prevent unwanted entry of
persons and the potential escape of the bear. The catch gate must be constructed in a manner that will contain the
bear. The gate must have appropriate hinges installed to ensure the integrity of the gate to contain the bear. Correct
by July 22, 2016
One side of the fence surrounding the den is held together with twine and the other side is not attached to any
support pole. Additionally, the there is no fence at the back of the den leaving that area open for unauthorized
persons to gain access and potentially serves as a area from which the bear could escape. A fence must be added
to completely enclose the den for the overall safety of the animal and public and to prevent escape. Correct by July
22, 2016
The metal den is excessively rusty and holes are present in various areas where the den comes in contact with the
ground. The holes in the den increases the risk of the bear being able to escape from this area and also allows forthe entry of unwanted animals. The den must be replaced to ensure containment of the bear, to prevent the
harborage of pests, and to provide shelter for the animal. Correct by July 22, 2016
***Whitetail Deer enclosure: A section of fence near the gate into the enclosure is damaged due to a fallen tree. As
a result, one of the support poles is leaning inward causing the section of fence to bend inward. There is also a
large gap between the gate and a fence support pole that does not allow the latch to close properly around the pole.
To prevent the escape of animals, the entry of unauthorized persons, and to reduce the risk of injury to the deer; the
fencing must to be repaired and the gate properly aligned in manner that will allow the latch to be secured properly
to the pole. Correct by July 22, 2016

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter Fence CRITICAL
***Bear Perimeter Fence: The perimeter fence around the bear enclosure is damaged from a fallen tree. Several
sections of the chain link fence is sagging to the point that that the structural strength of the fence is compromised.
The top fence support poles are bent and some have been removed. A perimeter fence must be constructed in a
manner that protects the animals and prevents entry of unauthorized person and unwanted animals. The perimeter
fence must be repaired to maintain the integrity of the fence and to ensure that unwanted animals and persons do
not come in direct with the bear.

Cleaning of enclosures
***The coatimundi enclosure: Surfaces of the wood climbing structures have a buildup of a dark brown material
which appears to be the build-up of dirt and food wastes.
***The bear enclosure has an excessive amount of fecal material within the enclosure.
***There is a buildup of dirt and debris on the legs and the bottom 3 inches of the white guinea pig cage.
The current frequency for removal of waste and cleaning of structures is not sufficient to prevent the build-up of
debris and waste materials. The enclosures must be cleaned in a manner and at a frequency that prevents the
build-up of food wastes and feces. The enclosures must be cleaned so as to prevent disease or illness. Correct by

SANITATION.
Housekeeping
***Admission Booth (also, houses ferrets and guinea pigs): The building is cluttered with spilled food, debris, and
unnecessary items on the shelves and floor. There are open buckets of corn for public feeding on the floor near the
entrance (door open). Rat feces was present on the floor and shelves of the building. The current cleaning practices
are ineffective and allows the build-up of debris and food waste, as well as the harborage of pests.
Debris, food waste, and unnecessary items must be removed from the area to prevent the attraction of pests.
Needed items must be organized in a manner that prevents the harborage of pests. Correct by July 13, 2016
***The barrier fence in front of the African-crested porcupine is detached from the support pole causing a portion of
the fence to bend inward. The fence must be reattached to the pole and supported in a manner that prevents the
fence from falling down to ensure the public does not gain access to an area that will allow direct contact with the
animal. Correct by July 29, 2016
*** The fence for the goat enclosure has areas that are bent outward and not buried in the ground, leaving a gap at
the bottom of the fence. These gaps can allow for goats to escape or be injured, and unwanted animals may be
able to gain entry into the enclosure. The fence must be repaired to eliminate the gaps under the fence for the
safety of the goats housed within the enclosure. Correct by July 29, 2016

SANITATION.
Pest Control
***Evidence of rodent feces are present on the floor and shelves of the Admission Booth.
*** Lemur enclosure (shelter): Rat holes were seen in the dirt area just in front of the lemur enclosure. A few holes
look as if they lead into the enclosure.
*** Old muntjac (no longer housing an animal) shelter enclosure A rat was seen in the enclosure. There are also
several rat holes present. This enclosure is adjacent to the lemur enclosure and there is a shared wall on the left
side of the lemur enclosure.
*** Rat holes were noted around the Himalayan bear enclosure in the area of the den.
***Rat feces is present inside the Admission Booth that houses ferrets, guinea pigs, birds, and turtles.
A significant population of rats exist on the property based upon the number of rat holes seen and the sighting of1-2 rats during the inspection. Although traps have been used, more effective measures must be taken to reduce
the population of rats. Additionally, an effective husbandry program must be developed with your attending
veterinarian and maintained to prevent the harborage of such pests. Correct by July 15, 2016
