ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:35 a.m. on
06-JUN-18.
Upon arrival I was able to make contact with the facility representative, she informed me that she was on her way
out and would not be able to do the inspection today.
