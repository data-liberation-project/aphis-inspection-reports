PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Within a relatively short time span in 2015 three animals, #28356, #28469, and #27373, developed infections in
surgical implants related to a study. Two of the animals had mainly localized infection, the third became generally ill.
They all received immediate care starting at the onset of signs of illness. Two of the animals died while under
treatment: #27373 arrested while in surgery to treat the infection and could not be resuscitated. #28356 was
euthanized while in surgery for treatment for the infection when the extent of the infection was determined to be too
great to continue. The third, #28469, had all of the implants removed to allow for healing. This animal is currently
doing well.
The IACUC must ensure that all personnel involved with animal work are properly trained and experienced in all
aspects of the proposed animal work. It must also evaluate all proposed activities for safety and appropriateness of
all components of the activities.
Correction: This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by engaging a Subject Matter Expert for an external
review on this study and related SOPs in the program. Changes to both were made and implemented. Monitoring
for efficacy of the changes is ongoing.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Several items in a cabinet in a lab were beyond the stamped expiration date: two tubes of antibiotic ointment, two
boxes of suture, and a box of bone wax.
Use of outdated items can be problematic because effectiveness, sterility, or safety cannot be assured beyond the
expiration date.
Correction: The outdated items were removed from the lab at the time of inspection.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility personnel.
