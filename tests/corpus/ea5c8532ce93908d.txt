2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The method of humane euthanasia for the rabbits at this facility consists of the inhalation of carbon dioxide gas
without prior sedation. In addition there is nothing written in the protocols which justifies this method. The 2013
AVMA Guidelines for Humane Euthanasia for this species state that "while CO2 is an effective method of
euthanasia, its use as the sole agent in rabbits results in apparent distress to the rabbit. Premedication with
sedative agents will allow for the administration of CO2 for euthanasia". Therefore, the use of CO2 alone as the sole
method of euthanasia is not consistent with generally accepted methods of euthanasia for rabbits. A system that
follows the currently accepted standards of humane euthanasia must be in place.
