ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
There was an incident of diversion of a controlled substance that led to one nonhuman primate possibly receiving
less than the optimum dosing of an opioid analgesic during clinical treatment. After the diversion was discovered,
the drug vial was analyzed and the drug was found to have been diluted. The animal did receive other pain
relievers and did not appear clinically painful during that time and recovered uneventfully.
The use of appropriate methods to treat diseases and injuries must be used and maintained to ensure animal
welfare. The employee involved in the incident has been terminated from employment. This drug has been
transferred to a central safe with limited access and is not in the lock box at the individual facilities. If an animal
needs the medication, aliquots are taken out to do the treatment. The research facility had instituted corrective
actions prior to this inspection.
During the inspection, a controlled drug cabinet was found open and unattended with the key in the lock. The
research facility has taken corrective actions for this issue. The principal investigator of the lab with the open drug
cabinet has placed a reminder sign on the procedure room door where the drug cabinet is located, and reassigned
the individual responsible for controlled substances in the lab. Completed as of 6/10/19.
In addition, the research facility will reiterate the expectation that all researchers must keep their controlled
substances secure at all times. The Office of Animal Welfare (OAW) will also send out a communication to
researchers about this expectation by 6/14/19. Additional periodic reminder communications will come through
OAW’s July newsletter, on-going OAW staff interactions with researchers and during IACUC semi-annual
inspections. Facility staff have also been instructed to report to their supervisors any drug cabinets found
unsecured.

On protocol #2225-06, a nonhuman primate underwent surgery and died during the recovery period. On the
morning of the surgery, it was found that the animal had not been fasted due to a miscommunication. The
veterinary surgical teams agreed to delay the procedure for over one hour (an abbreviated fast) and then
proceeded. The surgery was uneventful; however, the animal went into respiratory arrest during the recovery
period which lead to the need for CPR and re-intubation. During CPR, the animal was seen to vomit, and ingesta
was aspirated. The animal was revived and appeared to be recovering, but arrested again later and died. Based
on the clinical course, laryngospasm was postulated as the cause of death and aspiration of food may have been a
contributing factor.
Each research facility must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include pre-procedural
and post-procedural care in accordance with established veterinary medical and nursing care. Both the protocol
and the facility's SOP require that the day prior to the performance of the procedure, animals will be fasted after
their morning feeding for a minimum of 12 hours.
The research facility had instituted corrective actions prior to this inspection. The facility SOP is being revised to
include if an animal has not been fasted appropriately, the research procedure will be rescheduled. The only
exceptions would be in an emergency or clinical case, and must be approved by the Attending Veterinarian or the
Associate Director, Department of Primate Resources.
Inspection was conducted from June 4 - 6, 2019.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representatives.
