ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several animals were observed to have medical conditions requiring veterinary assessment or examination. There
was a very thin bison with ribs clearly visible. A female lion had a bloody ear lesion that the owner said had surgery
to remove a mass. A tiger had severe generalized patchy hair loss which was more pronounced on the neck and
shoulder areas. Another female lion had hair loss around the eyes, face, back and ear margins. A white raccoon
was thin, had hair loss and was walking stiffly. When asked for information regarding what veterinary care these
animals were receiving, the owner state that she does not keep any veterinary medical records at all and that
everything is with her attending veterinarian. She claimed the veterinarian had been out recently and seen some of
these animals. Some she described as having ongoing problems but when asked for records of what diagnoses or
treatments were being given she repeated several times that she didn’t keep any medical records. She provided
the number for the veterinarian and told us we would have to call him to get any information that we needed on any
of the sick animals. Some text communications were eventually shown to the inspectors to show that the
veterinarian had been on his way out to the facility recently to look at the lion with the ear lesion. The inspectors
called the veterinarian’s office twice on the morning of May 24,2017 and waited nearly three hours but no calls were
returned in that time frame. Therefore, the information available at the time of the inspection and the following day
was not sufficient to demonstrated adequate veterinary care for these animals.
Licensees shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate methods
to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Every facility should have a system of health records
sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate the delivery of adequate health care. Animals that are sick, injured, or
have medical problems must be examined by a veterinarian.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
A single ringed-tail lemur and a single bush baby were each individually housed in their respective enclosures
without being able to see and hear any other nonhuman primate of their own or a compatible species; psychological
distress secondary to social isolation could develop. The Environmental Enhancement plan was generic and did
not include provisions for social grouping of specific species. Also, the Environmental Enhancement Plan did notaddress considerations for a nonhuman primate that could not see or hear animals of their own or other compatible
nonhuman primates. The owner stated that the lemur had been separated from another one due to aggression but
no reason was provided for the animal being house out of sight and hearing of others of its species. The reason
given by the licensee for the bush baby being housed singly was the loss of its mate approximately a year
previously. However, this did not provide and explanation for housing it out of sight or hearing of other nonhuman
primates. Individually housed nonhuman primates must be able to see and hear nonhuman primates of their own or
compatible species unless the attending veterinarian determines that it would endanger their health, safety, or
well-being. The basis for exempting an individual animal from participation in the environmental enhancement plan
must be recorded by the attending veterinarian for each exempted nonhuman primate and must be reviewed at
least every 30 days unless the basis for the condition is a permanent condition. The Environmental Enhancement
Plan needs to be reviewed/updated, and must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards
as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing the jungle cat had a hole in the fencing in the lower left corner where the wires were bent
and separated. This could create a risk of escape or injury. This was repaired shortly after it was pointed out to the
owner.
An enclosure housing two lions had a den with a board on the roof which was separating from the structure and
had a screw/nail coming loose. Loose boards and sharp metal in the enclosure could cause injury.
The single zebra was housed in a pasture with fencing constructed of welded wire panels along the sided, and
barbed wire strands on the far end. The zebra was observed to rub it’s head on the side fencing where there were
exposed sharp wire points at eye level. Additionally, the zebra ran along the fence line and was observed tripping
and getting tangled in a dead tree limb that had fallen near the fence. The animal was trotting/strutting around and
bumping up against the fence; including the barbed-wire section. The sharp points in the fence panel, the sharp
points of the barbed wire, and the tree limb debris all pose a risk of injury. Debris and sharp pointed objects should
be removed, repaired, or replaced.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.
The facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The primary enclosure for the two Oriental small-clawed otters did not have an appropriate pool/container for the
animals to swim; only a small shallow bucket of water was observed at the enclosure. The otters were observedgoing to the shallow container several time and trying to get in it but it was barely big enough for one to fit in with the
water coming up to about belly height. The container was not big enough for both of them to get in at the same time.
The licensee said that they have access to a big swimming pool on another part of the property two to three times a
day when they do visitor “swim-with” encounters. However, encounters with the public do not occur every day.
Otters are aquatic animals and a normal behavior for them, and for which they are adapted, is two swim. The
enclosure was not adequate to allow normal postural and social adjustments and freedom of movement for this
species. The licensee showed the inspectors another pen that she said they had plans to renovate which had a
pool. The lack of appropriate housing for this species can be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of the animals
and could cause distress to animals. The primary enclosure for otters needs to provide sufficient space to allow
both otters to make normal postural, behavioral and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement;
including normal swimming behavior for the species.
In order to prevent potential health problems and abnormal behavior patterns for an aquatic species, a
pool/container of adequate size must be available in their primary enclosure.
