2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One blue colored adult male Shih Tzu (microchip number 17152) has an white colored, opaque area on the
center of the surface of the eye (cornea). There are small blood vessels in the center of the opaque area on the
cornea and minimal discharge on the surface of the eye. The upper/inner corner of the (cid:28)white(cid:29) of the eye is red. Eye
problems can be caused by trauma, infection, and other medical problems and can be painful. The animal listed
above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an
appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and
resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two enclosures, each housing a female dog and her litter, had 40 watt light bulbs overhead as a source of
heat for the puppies. These light fixtures were low enough for the mother dogs to come into contact with the bulbs
and did not have guards over the bulbs. Unguarded light bulbs can cause burns when they come into contact with
the dogs. The licensee must that housing facilities protect the animals from injury. Correct by 4/27/16.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* A strong odor was detected coming from the settlement pond during the inspection of this facility. The odor was
evident throughout the entire facility. The settlement pond is centrally located in the middle of the dogs being
housed in outdoor enclosures. In addition, there was a buildup of fecal waste and flies located along the edge of
the settlement pond. The licensee stated that the pond was last pumped in December 2015. Fecal waste buildup
over time can allow for strong odors to exist and attract pests which can transmit disease. Fecal waste needs to be
removed often enough to help reduce potential disease or health risks to the dogs. The licensee must maintain all
outdoor settlement ponds in a manner to prevent odors, diseases, pests and vermin infestation. Correct by 4/27/16.
3.9(b)FEEDING.
* A buildup of dried, caked feed and debris was observed in the interior of 15 food receptacles. A lack of cleaning
of the receptacles could promote bacteria growth and other disease causing agents which could increase the risk of
contamination of the feed. The nutritive value could be affected if the feed becomes spoiled or contaminated that
could lead to potential health risks. The licensee must ensure that measures are taken to ensure that there is no
molding,deterioration or caking of the feed. In addition, all food receptacles are kept clean and must be sanitized in
accordance with 3.11 (b) of the regulations. Correct by 4/27/16.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 4/13/16 were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver
VMO and Robert Bacon ACI.
