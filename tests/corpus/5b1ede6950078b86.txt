Sanitation.
There was excessive fecal build-up in numerous enclosures including one kinkajou enclosure housing one kinkajou, and
three sugar glider enclosures housing approximately 18 sugar gliders total. One of the sugar glider enclosures also
contained an approximately 6-inch PVC pipe and a wooden rod, approximately 24 inch long x ½ inch diameter, that were
