CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the building housing the indoor enclosures of the non-human primates, there are several fresh rodent droppings
on the wooden ledge outside of one of the capuchin enclosures. The droppings run along the length of the ledge
(approximately four feet), but are not within reach of the animals due to a barrier between the enclosure and the
ledge.
Rodents and other pests that have access to animal enclosures can have a negative impact on animal health by
potentially spreading disease or contaminating the food. Please correct by establishing and maintaining a pest
control program to reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct by July 7, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Farm Manager.
