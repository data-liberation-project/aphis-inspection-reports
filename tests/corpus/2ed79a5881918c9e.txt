ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:15 PM on
07-Mar-17.
Knocked on the door - no one answered. Called the licensee, and was told she was not on site, and would not be
back in time for an inspection, and that no one else was available to help with the inspection.
