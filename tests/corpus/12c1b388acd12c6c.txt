3.1(c)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures throughout the kennel had several days accumulation of feces (affecting sixteen adult dogs and
eight puppies). At least four of the enclosures had a brown material smeared on the enclosure walls. The feces was
embedded within the grated flooring. At least two of the enclosures had feces covering most of the floor such that
the Welsh Corgis within the enclosure were not able to move about in the enclosure without stepping in the feces.
Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with
Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. A cleaning program
needs to be implemented and followed to promote the health and well-being of the animals within the housing
facility.
3.1(f) DIRECT REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the northwest corner of the kennel underneath the enclosures and the wash down, brown to black water, hair,
and other debris are pooled (affecting sixteen adult dogs and nine puppies). There was a strong ammonia odor
throughout the kennel. This area of pooled water and debris increases the risks of vermin and pest infestation,
disease hazards, and odors within the kennel. A disposal and drainage system must be properly constructed,
installed and maintained in the kennel building so that waste and water are rapidly eliminated.
A tan colored, female Welsh corgi - named Brown Sugar - with no ID had been seen and treated by a veterinarian.
Treatment was prescribed and is being administered as directed. Additionally, the Welsh Corgi is being housed in
an enclosure by herself and is no longer housed with the other female Welsh Corgi who inflicted the wound.
This was a focused inspection report to address the direct non-compliants identified and documented on the May
12, 2014 inspection report.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
