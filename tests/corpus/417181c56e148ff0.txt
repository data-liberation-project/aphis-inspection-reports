ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-A 10 year old male lion, "Azland", was moving slow and appeared weak at the time of inspection which was at
approximately 1:00 pm. The lion staggered and swayed in the back end when walking. He also licked at the air
continuously; this behavior lasted most of the entire length of time we stood near the enclosure which was
approximately 15 minutes. The lion appeared to have a circular shaped area of hair loss over the right hip.
According to the licensee, she had noticed that "Azland" was walking different for about the past month and she
thought he was arthritic. She added that he had gotten a little bit rougher in that time and stated that its bad when
he first gets up and gets better and straightens up as the day warms up. According to the licensee, a veterinarian
had not been contacted about this animal's condition. This animal's condition could indicate an injury, infection or
other veterinary medical condition which could be painful. The licensee must have this lion examined by a
veterinarian. This veterinary examination is in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an
appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. To be corrected by: December 22, 2017.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
