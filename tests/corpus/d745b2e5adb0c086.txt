2.131(d)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An adult male raccoon is housed in an enclosure which does not afford him the opportunity to remove himself from
public exhibition. There is not a den box or quiet area off display available to him during the day. The facility has a
hammock near the top portion of the enclosure, which is inadequate to offer him reprieve from public display.
Animals that are on continual display can be expected to exhibit signs of behavioral stress, including displaying
stereotypical repetitive behaviors. This animal is given a dose of diazepam (sedative) each morning which,
according to facility representatives, is being given in order to reduce repetitive enclosure pacing. This animal is not
being exhibited under conditions consistent with his good health and well-being, as evident by his repetitive pacing
behavior, and the need for sedation. The licensee must revise the enclosure set-up in such a way to provide this
animal with a quiet area where he is able to remove himself completely from public display, and re-evaluate his
medication and treatment plan with their Attending Veterinarian.
