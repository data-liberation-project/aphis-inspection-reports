FACILITIES, INDOOR.
On July 19th, 2019, when an issue with the air conditioning system developed that compromised the ability of the
vivarium to maintain an appropriate ambient temperature for hamsters, animal facility staff were not made aware of
the issue in a timely manner. When the appropriate individuals were notified on July 20th, initial corrective measures
were taken. The temperature continued to rise, and recorded temperatures in the hamster facility on July 21st
ranged from 88 – 93 degrees. The initial corrective action was insufficient to maintain the appropriate temperature
for hamsters, leading to an ambient temperature of >85 degrees for more than 12 hours. Indoor housing for
hamsters shall provide for the health and comfort of the animals, and the ambient temperature shall not be allowed
to exceed 85 degrees.
To remain corrected after July 24th, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
