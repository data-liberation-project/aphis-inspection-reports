ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***Animal Care (AC) was informed of areas at the facility which house animals used for regulated activity, that were
unknown to the VMO. These include breeding goats used to stock the petting zoo, which are housed near the
facility garbage dump and exhibit mammals housed in the Tropics (reptile) building. The facility failed to inform the
inspecting VMO on this and previous unannounced routine inspections of these areas. At the conclusion of previous
inspections, the VMO would ask the facility(cid:25)s deputy director, if all covered/regulated animals had been inspected,
the director(cid:25)s response was always (cid:28)Yes(cid:29). During this and previous inspections the VMO inquired about the area
housing the goat enclosure and the reptile building, and was told by the facility director, that the areas only
contained the garbage dump, birds and/or reptiles. These areas were not disclosed as containing regulated
animals until the VMO asked to see the areas. During today's inspection of these areas, several non-compliances
were identified.
Failure of the facility to notify/inform the inspecting APHIS official, of all areas containing regulated animals, does
not allow for that official to enforce the regulations and standards set forth in the Animal Welfare Act.
Each dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to inspect
and photograph the facilities, property and animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the
provisions of the Act, the regulations and the standards in this subchapter.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***There is not an identifiable attendant present at all times when the public is allowed to feed the giraffes. From
10:30 a.m. to approximately 11:15 a.m., the Animal Care (AC) Veterinary Medical Officer (VMO) observed that there
was no attendant present at the giraffe exhibit. During this time the inspector observed several instances in which
members of the public (up to 15 people at a time) were feeding the giraffes without an attendant or employee being
present. On one occasion the VMO observed a member of the public touching the giraffe's nose while feeding the
animal. Over the course of approximately an hour, no attendant or employee was observed in the immediate orsurrounding areas where the giraffes are fed.
***There is not an identifiable attendant, present at all times, in the kangaroo walkabout area, where the public can
have contact with the animals. The public is allowed to walk through the kangaroo walkabout area, unescorted, on
the designated path. The public can contact the animals, as the animals are not restricted from crossing the
designated path. From 10:25 a.m. to approximately 11:15 a.m., the Animal Care (AC) Veterinary Medical Officer
(VMO) observed several instances, from the public side, members of the public (up to 30 people at a time) walking
through this area without an attendant or employee being present.
The absence of an attendant, whose sole responsibility is to oversee public contact with the animals, in these areas
endangers the health and well-being of the animals by potentially allowing activity (rough handling, improper
feeding, etc.) that is harmful to the animals. The licensee must ensure during periods of public contact, a
responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable attendant is present in these areas at all times.

3.80(a)(2)(9) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The enclosure housing 2 tamarins, in the Tropics building, had an area approximately 5 inches long of exposed
wood near the exhibit window which cannot be adequately cleaned or sanitized. The enclosure also had several
areas where the paint was peeling and exposing unsealed surfaces, which cannot be adequately cleaned or
sanitized.
Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized allow excreta, food waste, and other debris to accumulate on
the surfaces, posing a risk to the health of the animals.
Primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must be constructed and maintained so that surfaces in contact with the
animals can be readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced when worn or soiled.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The enclosure housing 19 goats had a piece of wood, used as a shade structure, which was not adequately
secured and was falling into the enclosure. Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can
cause injury to the animals.
***Behind the enclosure housing 1 squirrel in the educational area, a piece of steel wool was used to fill a hole in the
drywall. During the inspection, the Veterinary Medical Officer noted part of the steel wool had been pulled into theenclosure. The steel wool poses a risk of injury due to ingestion and intestinal obstruction.
***The enclosure housing 2 porcupettes, contained a blanket with frayed edges and long strands of material
accessible to the animals. The frayed strands pose a risk of injury due to ingestion and intestinal obstruction.
All structures must be maintained and kept structurally sound. Facilities and enclosures should be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury. The affected structures must be repaired, replaced or removed.

3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
***The breeding goats (housed near the garbage dump) were being fed on the ground in a manner that did not
minimize contamination. The VMO noted there was an accumulation of fecal material throughout the feed.
Contamination of feed by feces poses a risk for infection or parasite infestation. Food shall be placed so as to
minimize contamination to protect the health of the animals.
3.130
WATERING.
***The enclosure housing 19 goats had a dirty water receptacle. There was a buildup of green debris on the interior
surface of the receptacle along with green debris floating on top of the water. Water receptacles must be
maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the animals are provided with clean, potable
water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain adequate hydration. Water receptacles should
be cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***In the enclosure housing 19 goats, there was an excessive accumulation of feces present on the ground. Due to
the accumulation, the animals could not lie in their enclosure without becoming contaminated by the waste material.
***The enclosure housing 3 warthog piglets contained blankets that contained an excessive amount of feces.
Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to
reduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The licensee must
clean these enclosures and ensure that all enclosures housing animals are cleaned as often as necessary to
promote appropriate husbandry standards.3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***There is a large accumulation of building material and garbage near an enclosure housing 19 goats. The VMO
noted that the garbage dump was approximately 15 ft. from the animal enclosure and was emitting a foul odor.
Accumulation of garbage and debris near animal enclosures can lead to pest infestation, disease transmission and
reduced health of the animals. Accumulations of trash and debris shall be cleared as necessary to protect the health
of the animals.
