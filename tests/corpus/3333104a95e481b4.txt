3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor section of the dog enclosures are constructed of wire sides and floors. In at least one enclosure,
containing one adult dog, one wire side panel is no longer attached/contacting the wire front panel resulting in a
large gap. The inspector observed the dog sticking his muzzle/face through the gap. Large gaps between the
enclosure panels could cause injury to the dogs.
One enclosure, containing one adult dog and one puppy, has a large hole in the front of the enclosure where the
food receptacle has been removed and the opening is large enough for the adult dog to stick her entire head
through. The inspector observed the dog sticking it's head through the opening after the feeder had been reattached
and the dog had torn it down. The opening is also at the level of the puppy who was out of it's whelping box and
was walking around the enclosure. Openings in the wire panels could cause injury to the animals or allow the
animals to escape.
Housing facilities for dogs must be constructed and designed so that they protect the dogs from injury and contain
the animals securely. The licensee must alter the enclosures in a manner that removes the gaps and openings in
the wire panels to eliminate the risk of injury or escape. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are kept in
good repair and are safe for the dogs at all times.

In one enclosure, containing one adult dog and three puppies, there is a heat lamp containing a glass bulb hanging
from the top of the enclosure. The glass bulb is hanging low enough that the adult dog can come in contact with it.
Contact with glass heat bulbs can cause burns or injures to the dogs.
Housing facilities for dogs must be constructed and designed so that they protect the dogs from injury and contain
the animals securely. The licensee must add a heat guard or alter the heat lamp in a manner that eliminates the risk
of injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At least three enclosures, containing three adult dogs, have carpet squares for the dogs to sit and lie on. The edges
of the carpet squares have been excessively torn and shredded into long strands by the dogs. The damaged and
shredded carpet cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized which could increase the risk of disease hazards
towards the dogs and the animals could also become entrapped in the damaged carpets.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace the damaged carpet squares with
a surface that is capable of being adequately cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of
housing facilities are kept in good repair and can be readily cleaned and sanitized at all times.
To be corrected by: The licensee removed the carpets at the time of the inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(x) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In one enclosure, containing one adult female dog and one puppy, the flooring is constructed of wire. The
inspectors observed the feet and legs of the puppy fall through the openings in the wire flooring. Openings in
flooring that are large enough for the feet and legs to pass through could cause injury to the foot/leg or entrapment
of the puppy.
Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury and does not allow the dogs' feet/legs to pass through any openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the
flooring in a manner that does not allow the feet/legs of the puppy to pass through the openings. The licensee must
ensure that the flooring of the enclosure is safe for the dogs at all times.
