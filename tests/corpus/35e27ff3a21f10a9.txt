2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On 4/22/17 a one year old Eurasian Lynx with a history of seizure activity was found dead. According to facility
records, on 4/21/17 the animal had "back to back seizures". The attending veterinarian came to check on him, and,
according to facility records, she stated that the animal was "still adjusting to the meds", and that they should just
keep an eye on him. The next day the animal had a seizure again, and the vet was called, and, according to facility
records, she asked the facility to keep a close eye on him, and keep her updated. At 9 PM the animal was found
dead in his enclosure.
The exhibitor stated that the animal began having seizures at 8 months old. The animal continued to have
intermittent seizures since that time. The only treatment regimen ever attempted was phenobarbital alone, which
was not sufficient to adequately control the seizures in this animal.
A female lion cub, approximately 5 months old, was found to be lame in its hindquarters at the time of inspection.
On 3/15/17 in the facility records it was noted that the cub was favoring its right front leg. There was no feeding plan
available at the time of inspection, and it was unclear as to whether the cub is receiving an appropriate balance of
minerals in its diet necessary for normal bone development and growth. No diagnostics have been performed on
this animal since its arrival on site. The exhibitor stated that the animal has been observed by two veterinarians, and
that the veterinarians expressed a view that the cub would grow out of it. There was no consideration of the
possibility of metabolic bone disease, or other orthopedic problems.
Failure to provide appropriate diagnostics and treatment can result in a poor outcome for animals.The exhibitor
must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care, to include the use of appropriate methods to
diagnose and treat diseases. Veterinarians should have sufficient experience with the species on hand, so as to
ensure appropriate care.
The lion cub should be examined by an experienced veterinarian for a diagnostic workup by 5/1/17. All animals
should receive appropriate veterinary care from this time forward.
3.129(a)FEEDING.
There was no feeding plan for exotic cats available for review. At the time of inspection a female lion cub,
approximately 5 months old, had a pan of food that consisted entirely of muscle meat without bone. There were not
any supplements added to the meal, as the exhibitor stated she gives supplements only with morning or evening
meals. The cub was limping at the time of inspection, and a review of the facility records showed that the cub has
experienced intermittent lameness, which could be a sign of metabolic bone disease. When the inspectors asked to
see the supplements that were being fed to the cub, there was no open container of calcium supplement present.
The exhibitor had two unopened sealed bags of a white powder, which she stated was a calcium supplement, but
they were not labeled, and it was uncertain what form of calcium they might be, or how much should be fed. When
asked how much calcium the exhibitor was feeding to this cub, she stated that it depended on various
circumstances. The supplements were being stored in the exhibitor's home, rather than the food prep area. There
were no posted feeding instructions present.
Failure to provide an appropriate diet can lead to serious medical problems for the animals. The exhibitor must
ensure that diets have sufficient nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet should be prepared
with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. The exhibitor should develop
appropriate diet plans for the exotic cats on site.
To be corrected by 5/26/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the exhibitor.
