*****Analgesics were not administered to pig 35 as directed by the approved protocol. The protocol states "(cid:28)The
postoperative care will include analgesia which will be provided with buprenorphine (0.01-0.05 mg/Kg) BID for 3-5
days...". Pig 35 was given buprenorphine, 0.3mg, twice daily for one day post-op, then given buprenorphine,
0.3mg, once daily for the next two days. The medical records did not indicate that the attending veterinarian or the
IACUC was involved in the decision to change from twice daily dosing to once daily dosing.
The failure to follow the protocol and administer the buprenorphine as approved, at the prescribed times and
dosages, may have caused undue pain and suffering. All pain medications must be administered as approved by
the IACUC.
