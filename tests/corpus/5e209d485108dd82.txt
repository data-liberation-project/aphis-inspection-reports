2.4(d)
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
***At the start of this inspection, USDA inspectors requested documentation from the farm manager of animals that
were currently under veterinary treatment or have received treatment since the last routine inspection. The Farm
Manager stated that he was instructed by the licensee that any information regarding veterinary care and all
documentation about veterinary care would need to come from the attending veterinarian (AV). The manager
stated that he would call the AV and returned a short time later saying that he called the AV, and that the AV would
bring the veterinary records to the facility later, but that he was not available at that time. When asked the Farm
Manager stated that there were no records of veterinary care at the facility at that time and that there was no list of
animals currently receiving treatment. The USDA inspectors agreed to wait to ask questions regarding veterinary
advice provided when the AV arrived, however, they informed the Manager that a list of animals actively receiving
veterinary care was necessary to evaluate the adequacy of care being provided. When asked if he knew which
animals were receiving treatments the farm manager stated that he did know that information, but he would not
provide that information to inspectors (because of his previous instruction). Again inspectors reiterated that at a
minimum a list of animals receiving treatment was necessary to facilitate the inspection process and the Manager
stressed that his refusal to provide this information was at the instruction of the licensee. When the manager was
informed that refusing to provide this information would result in a citation for interference with the inspection
process, the Manager offered to call the licensee (cid:19) but was unable to reach him on the telephone for alternate
instruction. Several hours later the AV left records at the facility, however, at that time inspectors were conducting
the inspection in the drive through area and were not notified that he was on the property. Refusal of staff to provide
information regarding veterinary care including a list of animals currently undergoing treatment and description of
how treatments are being given (when known) prevents evaluation of the care provided to the animals and
interferes with the inspection process. During inspection APHIS officials compare advice provided by the AV to the
treatments administered by the licensee and staff in order to ensure that the recommendations provided are being
followed accurately and animals are receiving proper veterinary care. A licensee or representative shall not
interfere with any APHIS official in the course of carrying out his or her duties. The inspection process requires a
working relationship between the USDA and the facility and interference makes this process difficult to impossible.
Correct by ensuring that all facility staff are instructed to truthfully answer questions posed by inspectors and to not
otherwise interfere with the inspection process. 2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Brown and white Bohr goat #154 in the rear large gang stall of the dairy barn was found coughing on this
inspection. This goat appears to be in good body condition and was active during observation. This animal
requires examination by the attending veterinarian to determine the cause of this cough and any recommended
treatments.
*** Suffolk sheep #0596 was found in the first front stall of the dairy barn with 2 areas of hair loss and wounds on
the left shoulder and left flank area. Both of these areas are circular and have a scab located centrally. This animal
requires examination by the attending veterinarian to determine the underlying cause and severity of these lesions
and to determine the required treatment recommendations.
*** Suffolk sheep #326 in the rear large gang stall of the dairy barn was found limping on the right front leg. This
animal is walking on all four limbs but is only partially weight bearing on the affected limb and had a noticeable
head-bob when stepping on the right front foot. The ewe was intermittently observed holding this limb off the ground
when standing. Lameness is a common indicator of pain and examination and treatment by the attending
veterinarian is needed to prevent worsening of this condition and unnecessary suffering. There was no record at
the facility indicating that the lameness was observed prior to the inspection.
*** A black and white male sheep (#35) is being housed in an enclosure next to the production sheep barn with 2
other sheep and 7 zebu cattle. This male sheep has a circular area of hair loss and abrasion on the poll of the head
that is approximately the size of a quarter. The skin is red in that area with the center appearing to be scabbed.
There is no documentation of prior observation or treatment of this animal by the facility or the attending
veterinarian.
*** A male Tahr goat was found limping in the drive through area. Although, this animal is walking on all 4 feet it is
noticeably lame on the right rear leg and appeared to be only partially weight bearing. Lameness is a common
indicator of pain and examination and treatment by the attending veterinarian is needed to prevent worsening of this
condition and unnecessary suffering. There is no documentation or record of treatment for this animal from the
facility.
*** One Aoudad was found in the drive thru area with overgrown feet. The rear feet on this animal have grown to
where the toes on both hind feet are now overlapping. The outer claw is overgrown to the point that the toe is
curving upwards slightly off the ground while the inner claw appears to be growing towards and under the outer claw
such that the animal is walking on the inner claw. The right foot is more severely affected than the left at this time.
Left untreated overgrown hooves can cause abnormal forces to be placed on the joints in the foot and upwards in
the limb causing additional medical problems in affected animals. When hooves do not wear naturally, routine hooftrimming (as directed by the attending veterinarian) is necessary to prevent the development of additional veterinary
care problems. There is no documentation of prior observation or treatment of this animal.
*** One blackbuck antelope was found in the drive thru area with overgrown feet. The both hind feet are
significantly long. The inner claw on the left hind foot is overgrown to the point that the toe is lifting off the ground
slightly when standing. This animal moved away from the vehicle quickly during inspection and then stood on soft
ground limiting the ability to photograph this abnormality. There is no documentation of prior observation or
treatment of this animal by either the facility or the attending veterinarian.
***Two red and white bohr-type goats housed in the rear large gang stall of the dairy barn had large firm masses in
the area of their upper neck. The swelling on Goat #1131 was approximately the size of a small lemon located just
behind the mandible under the left ear. This mass was firm and non-movable. The swelling on Goat #1120 was
somewhat larger and located on the right upper neck at the junction of the head. Both goats were in good body
condition and observed eating during inspection. Significant swellings such as this are consistent with multiple
causes including infectious diseases and require appropriate diagnosis by the attending veterinarian to ensure that
animals are properly isolated and treated. There was no record at the facility indicating that the mass was observed
in either goat prior to the inspection or that the condition had been diagnosed by the attending veterinarian.
*** One black faced Suffolk-type sheep (ear tag #5 in the right ear and tag #6 in the left ear) group housed in first
stall of the (cid:28)Dawdy Barn(cid:29) had a large amount clear nasal discharge coming from both nostrils (worse from the left).
Small amounts of bedding and debris were present with this discharge. This animal was visited twice during the
inspection approximately 1 hour apart and the nasal discharge remained. The animal was observed laying down at
the time of the second observation and did not appear to be having breathing trouble. Increased nasal discharge
can indicate multiple veterinary problems both infectious and non-infectious and proper diagnosis and treatment by
the attending veterinarian are necessary to ensure that clinical signs do not worsen. There was no record at the
facility indicating that the nasal discharge was observed prior to the inspection or that the condition had been
diagnosed by the attending veterinarian.

During the inspection facility representatives were asked about these animals and they did not indicate any previous
observation of any of these abnormalities. Documentation of veterinary advice from the attending veterinarian was
provided by the farm manager, however, none of the animals listed above were included in that list. Failure to
provide timely adequate veterinary care to all animals in the facility can result in worsening of these conditions and
unnecessary animal suffering. All of these animals must be examined by attending veterinarian to determine
severity of the concern identified and to determine required treatment. Licensee must maintain documentation of
these exams and treatments for future review by APHIS officials.
Even though this is a repeat non-complaint item, these animals must be examined by the attending veterinarian byCOB on November 14, 2014.

*** 9 animals were found in need of veterinary care during this inspection including a Suffolk type sheep with hair
loss and wounds on the shoulder and flank, a coughing Bohr goat, 2 Bohr goats with swollen masses on their
necks, a limping Suffolk sheep, a Suffolk ewe with a nasal discharge, a black and white male sheep with an
abrasion and hair loss on the poll of its head, a limping Tahr goat, a Blackbuck antelope and Aoudad both with long
feet.. All of these animals were identified by USDA inspectors during this routine inspection. The facility provided
no documentation of care or knowledge of any animal problems. Daily observation continues to be a problem at
this facility and must be provided to ensure that animals exhibiting signs of ill-health are observed and timely
accurate information is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct this by ensuring all animals are observed
daily.

2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
When discussing routine care (such as foot care) for animals in the drive through, the farm manager stated that the
farm staff darts animals (using chemical capture as needed for routine care). He stated that they use several
products for restraint depending on the species and that the attending veterinarian was not usually present at the
time of such procedures. He was not sure how long it had been since the last time that they used such restraint,
and he stated that they do not keep records of chemical restraint or the use of these drugs.
The current approved program of veterinary care includes authorization for the licensee to use chemical restraint in
several species as needed. The forms provided by the attending veterinarian, includes check boxes for type of
restraint (manual or chemical) and a blank for the product to be filled in. According to this document the product for
chemical restraint is (cid:28)succos(cid:29) or (cid:28)succ(cid:29) for the following species: Eland, Elk, Grevy Zebra, Nilgai, Sika Deer, and
White Tail Deer. Muflon sheep are authorized by either physical restraint or chemical using (cid:28)succ(cid:29). Blackbuck
Antelope are authorized using (cid:28)Rompun(cid:29). There is no dose or route of administration included in this guidance.
Additionally, there is no guidance for anesthesia, analgesia, or supportive care necessary during such procedures.
When asked, the farm manager confirmed that the abbreviation (cid:28)succ(cid:29) or (cid:28)succos(cid:29) was for succinylcholine. Hestated that typically when chemical restraint is needed, he calls the licensee to get the dosage to be used for the
species. They do not currently provide any additional analgesia or anesthesia for animals under restraint by
Succinylcholine nor do they have the equipment necessary to intubate animals or ventilate animals that stop
breathing. When asked what would happen if an animal stops breathing while using this drug, the farm manager
stated that (cid:28)it isn(cid:25)t pretty(cid:29) and that they die.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) properties. When under the influence of
Succinylcholine animals are paralyzed, but retain consciousness and are capable of feeling pain and distress. In
addition to preventing movement this drug can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing
and if animals are not properly ventilated (and used without additional anesthesia), they can die of suffocation while
they remain conscious. Licensee must maintain a program of veterinary care that includes adequate guidance
regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, and tranquilization. Providing the authority to use
paralytic drugs for immobilization or anesthetic drugs such as Rompun without instruction for dosing, routes of
administration, or necessary supportive care is not adequate guidance. The use of these drugs without guidance
that is within established standards of veterinary care can compromise the health of these animals and may result in
unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and / or death. Correct by consulting with the attending veterinarian
to ensure that adequate guidance regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, and tranquilization is
incorporated into the written program of veterinary care.
Correct by: Prior to any future use of any chemical restraint and not later than 13 December 2014.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public continues to be permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing various species of
animals. This includes 3 camels, 138 sheep, 23 goats, 7 zebu cattle, and 6 muntjac deer. There are no barriers or
signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food sold at the entry gate. There
is no attendant present during this public contact. Primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large
enough for the guests to reach through and touch the animals. This unattended public contact continues to be a
problem at this facility and does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Barriers or sufficient distance
must be provided to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.

2.131(d)(2) REPEATHANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Guests are still allowed to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. No attendant is present in the drive
through area when these unaccompanied visits are taking place. Animals in the drive thru area include: deer,
antelope, bison, llamas, zebra, water buffalo, pigs, and others. A hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the entry
gate advises them to remain in their vehicles at all times but does not discourage feeding. This facility also has
horse drawn wagons that takes guests thru and allows public feeding with an attendant present. Allowing guests to
feed from vehicles without attendants present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a
barrier or distance from the animals and the public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all times during public
contact.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure housing 7 zebu cattle and 3 sheep has an approximately 8 foot area of chicken wire fencing that
is currently detached from parts of the wooden fence behind it and hanging loose from the inside of the enclosure
fence. This area is a potential injury hazard to the animals. The facility representative stated that this chicken wire
fencing was added to the bottom of the primary enclosure fence to prevent smaller animals that were previously
housed in this enclosure from escaping. This area of fencing must be removed or repaired to avoid potential injury
to the animals and all areas of the facility must be maintained in good repair to protect animals from injury. This
wire was removed from the enclosure prior to exit interview.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The large heap of animal waste and bedding remains in the drive through area of the facility. Animals housed in
this area of the facility have access to this large pile and have been observed browsing, lying, and feeding from this
mound. This direct contact by the animals with this waste pile exposes them to unnecessary disease risks and
potential disease transmission from other animals(cid:25) waste. This is especially of concern as several animals were
found with illnesses during this inspection. Correct this by removing this waste pile from the animal area and
dispose of animal wastes properly.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED*** Inspection conducted on November 12, 2014 with the farm manager and facility staff. Exit interview conducted
with the farm manager on November 13, 2014.
Note: A list of animals found in need of veterinary care on this inspection was verbally given to the farm manager
after the physical inspection on November 12, 2014.
