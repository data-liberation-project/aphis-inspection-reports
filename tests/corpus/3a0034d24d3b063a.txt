2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male, adult Pomeranian with chip number 025 866 343 has a thin body condition. The hip, back, and shoulder
bones are easily palpable. There is poor muscle condition of the rear legs. The licensee acquired this dog 20 July
2014 and reports that she has given the dog deworming medication for this concern. This dog has not been
evaluated by a veterinarian. Thin body condition can indicate a variety of medical problems or decreased nutrition.
The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
This dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian by 28 October 2014.
There is a bottle of azithromycin capsules in the whelping building currently being used for one dog. This medication
does not have an expiration date. Unknown expiration dates could lead to the use of expired medication which may
result in spoilage or reduced efficacy. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not
expired and labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices.
2.50(a)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Two shiba inu puppies, approximately 3 months old were obtained by the licensee for breeding purposes and are
not officially identified. Also there is a litter of two American Eskimo puppies housed with one shiba inu puppy.
These puppies are not officially identified. Proper identification is essential for tracking of the dogs and puppies in
the kennel. All weaned puppies must be officially identified. Correct by 30 October 2014.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an accumulation of dirt and mouse feces on top of the refrigerator in the whelping kennel building. This
refrigerator is used for storing medications for the dogs and puppies. Dirty surfaces and mouse droppings maycontaminate the contents of the refrigerator. Supplies must be stored in a manner that protects them from
contamination and vermin infestation. Correct by 26 October 2014.
3.3(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
One of the two fluorescent light fixtures on the ceiling of one sheltered kennel building is not operating. The lack of
light from this fixture results in one half of the inside of this building being dark which does not permit good
conditions for inspections and observations of the dogs. Sheltered housing facilities must have sufficient
illumination to aid in inspections and observations of the animals and for adequate cleaning. Correct by 6
November 2014.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
