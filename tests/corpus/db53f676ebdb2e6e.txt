2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the outdoor facility, there was one adult Poodle identified as #086804106 that was constantly licking around
the mouth area or moving the mouth as to be biting on something. This dog had brown buildup on the teeth. The
back teeth on the top and the bottom were encased with the buildup. One of the back teeth on the top right side
appeared to be broken. Some teeth in the front bottom were missing and some displaced. Dental care is essential
for prevention of infection, oral injuries, diseases and promotes the overall health of the animal. The licensee must
have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by June 25, 2015 and assure that all regulated animals receive
adequate veterinary care as required.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The APHIS 7005 inventory records were incomplete. There were at least twelve dogs listed that had no
identification and there were at least five listed that did not have the acquisition information. Appropriate
documentation of acquired animals is essential for proper identification and each animal must be able to be traced
forward and backward. The licensee must update and complete the inventory records and assure that all records
are maintained as required.
To be corrected by June 26, 2015.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Sec. 3.6 Primary enclosures.
(a) General requirements. (2) Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they:
(x) Have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury.
***In the whelping house, there were three enclosures containing puppies that had areas of 1"x1" wire. Some of the
puppies' feet were passing through the openings in the flooring. In the shelters in the outdoor facility, there was
carpet on the floors. The carpet strings in some of these shelters had become dislodged and created large wads ofmatted string on the floor of the shelter. Allowing feet and legs to pass through the openings in the flooring and
matted wads of carpet string increases the risk of injury to to animal by providing a trip or trap hazard. The licensee
must construct the wire flooring so that the feet do not pass through the openings, remove the carpet strings or
replace the material and assure that all floors are maintained to protect the animals as required.
To be corrected by June 26, 2015.
3.9(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
***In the outdoor shelter there were at least four self feeders that had wet, caked and molded food in them.
Contaminated food increases the risk of illness to the animals by ingesting the contamination. The licensee must
remove the contaminated food and assure that wholesome, uncontaminated and palatable food is being provided
as required.
The licensee understands that this is to be corrected today, June 22, 2015.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sec. 3.11 Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
(c) Housekeeping for premises.
***Around the outdoor enclosures, there was tall grass and weeds against the fence. Tall weeds and grass create a
harboring place for pests and parasites and increases the risks for contact between pests, parasites and the dogs.
The licensee must clear the grass and weeds so that they do not enter the primary enclosure and assure that such
items are controlled as required.
To be corrected by June 26, 2015.
