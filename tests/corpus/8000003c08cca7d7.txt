ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 300pm on
27-Jun-19.
No one was at the facility, and contact was made by phone to the licensee. The licensee was too far away and
unable to return for an inspection. Optimal days and times of inspection were discussed.
