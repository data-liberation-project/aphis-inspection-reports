SANITATION.
Excessive amounts of rodent feces were observed in two areas of the facility during the time of inspection. In the
facility's largest animal room, an animal transport kennel located next the squirrel's enclosure had an abundance of
feces inside. In the kitchen and food preparation area, a large concentration of feces was present under the
refrigerator. Finally an abundance of feces was present on the floor, behind the sealed food containers. The facility
has a pest control program in place, but it is not effectively controlling the population of rodents. Rodents and their
feces can carry and spread diseases.
An effective program for the control of rodents must be implemented and maintained at the facility.
