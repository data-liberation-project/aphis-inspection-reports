A focused inspection was conducted on December 1, 2016 to look at the pig, Kevin, and his enclosure.
Kevin was in an enclosure with the pig that had been with him previously, as well as one new one. More straw had
been added as bedding in the shelter and the tarp that was previously in contact with the heat lamp had been
removed. The roof of the enclosure was covered with a quilt that was not in contact with the heat lamp. The heat
lamp had been turned on. When the inspector approached the enclosure, the three pigs were outside the shelter
and did not appear to be in any discomfort.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, facility representative, and VMO Dominique
Engel.
