ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Sassy", a female bobcat was observed with a broken right front leg approximately three inches up from the toes.
During the last inspection the foot was dangling and it was clearly broken. There was no broken skin or discharge
observed. The licensee stated that "Sassy" had arrived at the facility in this condition and had been seen by the
veterinarian. The licensee further stated that the veterinarian said that nothing could be done for the animal. When
the licensee was asked for the medical documents, she indicated they were at the veterinarian clinic, but she would
obtain them.

On today's inspection the licensee was asked again for medical documentation, but could not provide any. The
attending veterinarian was contacted and it was discovered that the attending veterinarian had no knowledge of a
bobcat with a broken leg at the licensee's facility. The inspector was unable to view "Sassy" as she was in the area
where other bobcats had just given birth and another was about to give birth.

The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat animals is a requirement of this section of
the Animal Welfare Act. Failure to obtain appropriate veterinarian care for Sassy has caused "Sassy" unnecessary
pain and discomfort from the bone on bone contact and may have caused a lifetime disability.The licensee is required to have "Sassy" seen by the attending veterinarian and to follow all recommendations
including those regarding examination, diagnosis, treatment and future recheck examinations as needed.
Additionally, the licensee must maintain a record of these recommendations for APHIS officials.

The license was verbally instructed to make phone contact with the attending veterinarian and have a medical
appointment by close of business September 17, 2015, same day as the inspection.

An exit interview was conducted with facility representative.
