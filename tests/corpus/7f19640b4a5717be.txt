3.80(a)(2)(iii) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The facility failed to adequately contain a nonhuman primate (NHP) securely and to prevent accidental opening of
the enclosure. On October 11, 2016 an employee accidentally released a female gorilla (Huerfanita) from her
enclosure. The gorilla was able to gain access to a service area where a facility contractor was working. The gorilla
returned to her enclosure without harm to herself or a human. Failure to contain NHPs securely poses a risk of
injury to the animal, to employees, and to the public. The facility must ensure that all NHPs are contained securely
and must prevent accidental opening of the enclosures, including opening by the animal.
3.85 CRITICAL
EMPLOYEES.
Upon review of zoo documents, it appears that there were several contributing factors to the escape of the female
gorilla (Huerfanita). One factor was the failure of a zoo employee to check the "white board" which gave the exact
location of all animals in the gorilla building. Another factor was that the zoo employee did not conduct a visual
check of the area before opening the enclosure door to begin cleaning. Employees who provide animal husbandry
must be adequately trained and supervised to assure the proper care of all non-human primates. Training must
include detailed instructions on the safe and proper methods to be used when working with non-human primates.
3.133 DIRECT
SEPARATION.
The male hyena (Dubu) has sustained several serious injuries from the female hyena (Smilla) during numerous
attempts by zoo staff to introduce them. Upon review of the zoo veterinary medical records, it was noted that the
female hyena injured the male hyena on at least 10 different occasions between May & October of 2016. The last
incident resulted in a laceration on his right hip. The wound is dripping blood and muscle is exposed. To be
corrected from this point forward.This two day inspection was conducted on October 24 & 26, 2016.
Inspection was conducted with Dr. Kjos and facility representatives on October 24, 2016.
Inspection and exit briefing was conducted by Dr. Kjos and Cindy Rhodes with facility representatives on October
