Outdoor housing facilities.
Perimeter fence. A section of the perimeter fence approximately 10 feet in length is still not repaired from a large tree that
fell over in 2020. The section of damaged fence is near the outdoor lemur enclosure and a empty enclosure that was
destroyed by the fallen tree. The perimeter fence is required to keep unwanted species out such as dogs, skunks, foxes,
and raccoons from going through it or under it and having contact with the non-human primates. Correct by removing the
fallen tree and replacing the broken section of the perimeter fence to protect the non-human primates from unwanted
species when they are kept in the outdoor enclosures. Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
