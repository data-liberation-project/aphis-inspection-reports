ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:40 PM on
12-Feb-19.
I arrived and knocked on door, no one answered. I called primary phone number which has been disconnected. I
left a message on cell phone number. I waited and honked several times. Licensee called me back and said he
was shopping in OKC and was unavailable for an inspection.
