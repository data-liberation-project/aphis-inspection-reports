ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** There were expired drugs found above the grooming area in the main kennel which included Tylan lot # 60430A
exp 7/07 and GentaMax lot # 130101 exp 2/15. Expired drugs should be removed by expiration date so they are not
accidentally used as there is concern to the effectiveness of the drugs that have expired. This needs to be
addressed for the safety of the dogs.
*** The facility had transferred two supplements (wheat germ oil and vitamins) into smaller bottles for distribution to
the dogs, but the smaller bottles were not labeled to clearly identify what was in them. It is important that when
transferring to unlabeled containers that they are labeled correctly with the product information including date of
expiration for the safety of the dogs.
*** Several of the dogs had inter digital cysts that the licensee stated her husband was treating with a medicated
spray, including a pug #43. There was nothing written down that the dogs were being treated and no treatment plan
was written in detail by the attending vet. As these dogs are on wire and prone to inter digital cysts a treatment plan
should be documented for these common issues for the health and comfort of the dogs.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The outdoor enclosure has two sections of wire that are draped over the sides to keep dogs from jumping out of
the enclosure. The wire on the sides of the chain link are not secured to the fence so there are sharp wires
protruding into the enclosure. These sharp points could be a potential hazard to the dogs and need to be addressed
for safety of the animals.
*** The same outdoor enclosure has several sections of fencing on the front panel by the door that is rusted and
starting to flake off. These sections of the enclosure need to be addressed and rust removed to keep the enclosure
structurally sound and able to be cleaned.
*** The sheltered building has sections of thick plastic covering the wire flooring at the doors and along the middleover the pvc center pipe to facilitate cleaning. Some of the plastic is chewed to the point it can not longer be cleaned
and is coming up off the floor. These sections of plastic need to be addressed to keep the enclosures in good repair.
*** One of the swing doors of the sheltered building that gives access between the indoor and outdoor run needs to
be addressed. The door is broken and the frame on the outside has sections of metal that is coming off the building
and the hinges are rusted. This frame needs to be maintained in good repair for the safety of the dogs.
*** Some of the plastic lining underneath the whelping enclosures is broken and separating from the wall which is
leaving the wood behind the plastic previous to moisture. The area underneath the whelping boxes must be
maintained in good repair to facilitate cleaning of the area.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The food and bedding storage area needs to be de cluttered and cleaned. There are dirty whelping boxes that
are being stored in the room with evidence of feces still in the box, there are trash items (empty food bags)
miscellaneous items (crates, barrels) also throughout the area. The window ledge has an accumulation of dead flies
and there was mice droppings on the floor. In addition there was a large wheel barrow that is used for mixing food
and supplements for the dogs that has not been cleaned. Areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be
free of any accumulation of trash, and other discarded materials. This area needs to be cleaned and organized to
keep the food free from contamination and for the health of the dogs.

3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The area underneath the outdoor wire mesh enclosures has an accumulation of feces up along the back wall of
the building that is not being removed on a routine basis. The area was recently scraped down but the rake does
not reach as far as the back wall. This needs to be addressed so the entire area underneath the wire mesh
enclosures can be sufficiently cleaned.
*** The same feeder in the sheltered building was again filled with feces and the food was not able to get into the
main trough area due to the accumulation. As this dog is known to poop in the feeder this feeder should be
checked daily so feces is removed and the dog has access to clean food. Fecal and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as often
as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs and to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. These enclosures need to be cleaned for the health and comfort
of the dogs.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The facility is not being sanitized on a routine basis. There is still a buildup of dirt, debris and hair throughout the
enclosures and underneath the enclosures. This excess hair can trap urine and fecal debris causing strong odors
throughout the kennel. The fans over the enclosures are very dirty with hair and debris throughout the fan and these
need to be cleaned as well.
*** The sheltered building has not been sanitized since the last inspection according to the licensee. This building
was reported on the last inspection as not having been sanitized, hence this building has not been cleaned in
multiple months. There is an accumulation of hair on the tops of the enclosures and in corners. There is fecal
material and grime caught between the black plastic on the wire mesh floor. Underneath the enclosures are large
buckets that collect excess water from the automatic drinkers. These buckets are filled to the top with water also
containing bugs, fecal material and debris. The water serves as a breeding ground for pests and bacteria and need
to be dumped and cleaned on a frequent basis.
For the health of the dogs, primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. This needs to be
addressed and the corrective action may include creating a schedule and following through with a cleaning routine.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** To the right of the outdoor enclosure housing the large breed dogs, there is still trash and debris items and
miscellaneous items with an overgrowth of weeds. Weeds must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the
premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of the animals. This area currently promotes a
breeding and living ground for pests and vermin.
Animal areas must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, and to promote good
housekeeping practices.
3.12 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.*** The facility currently does not have enough trained employees to carry out an acceptable level of husbandry
practices and care required for these dogs. The licensee's state that they expect their children to do a certain
amount of work and care for the dogs. One owner works in the kennel in the morning prior to going to his job and
the other owner has not had the ability to be in the kennel as much as needed to supervise the care of the dogs.
The facility states they they hired an employee to come in one day a week, but that employee has not been able to
come the past two weeks. Based on the number of non compliant items in the report it is evident that the facility
needs to hire additional staff or reduce numbers of animals. This needs to be addressed to maintain an acceptable
level of husbandry and care for the dogs.
This inspection was conducted with the licensee. Throughout the inspection, the non compliant items listed on the
report were identified and discussed. When the inspectors went back to identify what would be on the final report,
the licensee sent her children out to inform the inspectors that the licensee would not be coming back out and she
was "done talking for the day." The inspectors reviewed what would be on the final report and left the property,
