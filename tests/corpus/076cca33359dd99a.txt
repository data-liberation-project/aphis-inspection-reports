Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Prior to the day of inspection (7/18/22), there was a solitary ground squirrel that was isolated and quarantined away from
the rest of the colony due to an active skin condition. However, the animal’s skin condition was not reported to the
veterinarian until the day after the inspection (7/20/22). Failure of communicating accurate information in a timely manner
to the attending veterinarian (AV) could lead to suffering and worsening of the animals’ condition. Each exhibitor shall
establish and maintain programs of veterinary care that, when daily observations are not performed by the AV, a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the AV.

Contingency planning.
At the time of inspection, the facilities’ contingency plan that was available for review was incomplete, whereby it was
missing some of the following information: common identifiable emergency situations known to the local area; outlines for
specific tasks required to be carried out in response to the identified emergencies or disasters, an identifiable chain of
command, along with their name and/or position and their associated response duties; and addressment of how response
and recovery will be handled (in terms of materials, resources, and training needed). Should a foreseeable disaster occur,


an incomplete contingency plan would put the well-being of the facilities’ animals at risk if the instructions were not
documented and followed, possibly at the expense of their lives. Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an
appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the
event of an emergency or disaster (one which could be reasonably anticipated and expected to be detrimental to the food,
health, and well-being of the animals in their possession).

Veterinary care for dogs.
At the time of inspection, the most current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for the dog at the facility was incomplete. An
incomplete PVC could negatively impact the health and well-being of the animal if the scheduled routine care instructions
– from the PVC - are not documented and followed. Each exhibitor must: follow an appropriate PVC for dogs that is
developed, documented in writing, maintained, and addresses the requirements of adequate veterinary care, including,
but not limited to, preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and
clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth. The facility elected to retire the dog.

Facilities, general.
In the outdoor portion of the otter exhibit, there was an exhibition window made of plexiglass – along the main guest
pathway – that had two metal pieces lining the top and bottom of the window/glass (approximately 3-4 feet in length and
2-2.5 inches in width). When the inspector rested her arms on the upper metal landing, she had to immediately withdraw
her arms as it was very hot to the touch. An infrared gun was then used to check the surface temperature of the metal in
the enclosure at the level of the animals, where the readings ranged between 143-147 degrees Fahrenheit, which at


these temperatures could burn/injure them. The facility must be constructed of such material as appropriate for the
animals involved, and the indoor and outdoor facilities must be structurally sound and maintained to protect the animals
from injury. The facility corrected the issue during the inspection whereby a piece of wood was placed over the metal
landing that the otters had access to.

This inspection, along with an initial exit briefing conducted on July 19, 2022, and a final briefing on August 4, 2022, were
all conducted with a facility representative.
