PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the Capuchin enclosure, the wire shelf inside the shelter area was missing a supporting bracket and was bowing
under the weight of the Capuchins when they landed on it. The wire shelf is no longer structurally sound or in good
repair and could potentially break, creating sharp edges that could result in injuries to animals. There must be a
system of maintenance in place.Correction date 14 July 2015

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter fence/Secondary Containment
At the gate entering the Lion compound, there was 4-6" of space under the main gate where the road has eroded
away, creating a space big enough for a small cat or raccoon to enter. The fence must protect the animals in the
facility by restricting animals or unauthorized persons from going through or under it.
-In the Lion compound, some of the shade trees adjacent to the perimeter fence have grown to a height and width
that could support the weight of a cat and therefore reduces the effective height of the perimeter fence to less than 8
ft.
-In the Lion compound, there are fencing materials and bricks stored adjacent to the perimeter fence that reduce the
effective height of the fence to less than 8 ft.
The perimeter fence must have an effective height of 8 ft or more so that it can function as a secondary containment
system for the animals in the facility.
