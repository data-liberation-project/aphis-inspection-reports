2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Examination of APHIS form 7005, Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand, revealed that there is no
official USDA identification number for any of the dogs. Licensee stated that none of the dogs had official USDA
identification, but each dog is identified by an individual name and this is noted on APHIS form 7005. Official USDA
identification is necessary to complete all required paperwork. Licensee must provide each dog that is four months
of age or older with proper USDA identification using either approved ear tattoo, approved microchip or approved
collar tag affixed to the dog's neck. These identification numbers must be added to APHIS form 7005 as well as,
any other APHIS form that requires it.
