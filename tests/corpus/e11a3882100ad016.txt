2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male spotted skunk (approximately 3 years old) has a hairless area behind the shoulder blades along the spine.
The area is reddened and a dark brown crusty material was present. Closer examination of the animal revealed
numerous small black insects crawling throughout the affected area. The licensee was unaware of the condition and
stated that he has never applied parasite control products to the spotted skunk.
A white, adult, female skunk has extreme hair loss on its body. The area behind both shoulder blades, across the
back, and around the base of its tail are nearly completely devoid of hair. The hair loss extends down the sides of its
body to its abdomen. The last one-third of the tail also has severe hair loss and a crusty dark brown material is
present on the affected area.
A white, adult, female raccoon has abnormal areas of hair loss on its body. The hair loss is located behind the rib
cage across the right and left flank area. The area of hair loss is larger on the right side of the body and the entire
tail is completely devoid of hair.
The licensee has not consulted a veterinarian about the abnormal health conditions of the animals listed above.
Skin problems can indicate the presence of ectoparasites, poor health or nutrition or injury/trauma to the animal.
Conditions such as these may be painful, cause discomfort and lead to further health complications.
Appropriate methods to prevent, control, observe, diagnose and treat diseases, injuries or parasite problems should
be in place for all animals. The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure
that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This
information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made
available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary
care at all times.
3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures, containing a total of four foxes, have nails protruding through the wooden braces into the
enclosures. The ends of the nails have created sharp points which the foxes could come into contact with while
moving throughout the enclosures.
Five enclosures, containing eleven ferrets, have metal water receptacles. The water receptacles are attached to the
side of the enclosure by wire. The ends of the wires are creating sharp points which the ferrets could come into
contact with when drinking from the receptacles.
Four enclosures, containing thirteen ferrets, have a plastic shelf. The plastic shelf is attached to the corner of the
enclosure by wire. The ends of the wires are creating sharp points which the ferrets could come into contact with.
Four enclosures, containing eight ferrets, have broken wires around the entry door into the den box. The ferrets
could come into contact with the sharp ends of the wires as they enter and exit the den box.
Sharp wire points that animals can come in contact with could cause injuries, be very painful and potentially lead to
additional health problems.
The licensee must ensure that all housing is constructed of material appropriate for the animals housed and is
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals safely. Continual monitoring
and maintenance of cage and housing is an ongoing process.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The interior surfaces of the machine used to prepare food for the regulated animals have an accumulation of dried
and caked food material. There's also a buildup of old and fresh food waste under and on the exterior surfaces of
the machine. The licensee stated that it has been about a month since it was cleaned.
Food waste that is not frequently removed from food receptacles, food preparation areas, food storage areas and
housing facilities can lead to contamination, disease hazards and vermin infestations.
The licensee must remove food waste and other debris as often as necessary to minimize odors, vermin
infestations and disease hazards.
3.131(a) REPEATSANITATION.
One enclosure, containing at least one white raccoon, has a buildup of old excrement located in front of the den
box. Most of the excrement is dried and covered in a gray material that has the appearance of mold.
Another enclosure, containing three raccoons, has a thick layer of dried food waste and organic material covering
the surfaces on the front-half of the wire enclosure.
Three ferret enclosures, containing twelve ferrets, have an excessive buildup of old and new feces in the back
corners. An enclosure containing one ferret, has an excessive buildup of feces located directly next to and beneath
the opening of the den box.
Failure to remove excreta, food waste and other organic material from the enclosures can lead to contamination,
disease hazards and odors, which can affect the health and well-being of the animals.
The licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from all primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Corbin Ranslem, ACI, Kelly Maxwell, ACI and
Ann Goplen, VMO.
*The white skunk listed under 2.40 (b)(2) on the December 7, 2016 inspection report received veterinary care.
