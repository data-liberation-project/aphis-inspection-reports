2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was one dog observed with a health condition requiring treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or
consultation with the attending veterinarian. Sparky, id# 9232, a male red Shiba Inu, DOB 7/31/19, had an abnormal right
ear. The interior of the ear was red, irritated, and swollen with a moist brown discharge. The licensee had not observed
the health condition, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and was not administering any treatments. The
Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and provided treatment options.
Swelling and redness with discharge in the ears may be indicative of infection and/or other veterinary medical conditions
that can cause pain, discomfort, as well as damage to the ear.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending veterinarian to
determine a plan for diagnosis and treatment.

3.1(a) Critical

Housing facilities, general.
In May of 2022, a female Shiba Inu jumped over the wall in the outdoor run and was hit by a car and died. The walls are
approximately 5 feet high but the licensee had noticed the dog jumping and has found other dogs outside the kennel.


Failure to provide housing that contains the animals can lead to animal escape, injury, and death.
Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely.
