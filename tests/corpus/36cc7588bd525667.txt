3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
Within the outdoor housing facility of two nilgai, two areas of disrepair were observed:
• An unused, deteriorating, hanging roofed hay feeder was loosely attached to the interior of the enclosure’s fence. It was
hanging sideways, no longer secured, and therefore, not structurally sound.
• Metal fence panels were lying in the pasture close to the back enclosure fence.

Both areas may cause injury to the animals if the hay feeder falls, has sharp nails protruding, or the metal fence panels
entrap the animals’ limbs. The housing facility must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
MUST BE CORRECTED BY: SEPTEMBER 22, 2022.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
Two sides of the perimeter fence near the bear enclosure were not in compliance. On the left side, there is overgrowth of
vegetation including trees, vines, and shrubs growing on top and through the fence which may compromise the
effectiveness of the structure. The left rear corner is leaning in toward the bear enclosure, decreasing its height, and is


not structurally stable. Additionally, along the left rear side and back portion of the perimeter fence there are multiple
significant gaps under the fence that may allow unwanted animals and/or people to access to the bear, which may expose
it to hazards such as disease, distress, and/or injury. The overgrowth of vegetation must be cut back and removed from
the perimeter fence, the left rear corner become structurally sound, and all holes under the fence must be eliminated while
maintaining an 8-foot height.
MUST BE CORRECTED BY: SEPTEMBER 22, 2022
