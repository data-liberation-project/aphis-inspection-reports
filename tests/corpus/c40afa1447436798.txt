2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on February 26, 2015, records of animal births and deaths were not maintained for
the hamsters and gerbils. Records must be kept on animals for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care
program, and to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. A system of record keeping containing births and
deaths must be maintained and available for review. Correct by January 26, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
