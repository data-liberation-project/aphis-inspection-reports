3.13(c)(3)
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
Two cats were arriving at SFO from London Heathrow on Virgin Airlines waybill # 932-51698043. There was no
shipper's declaration attached to the top of the carrier regarding feeding and watering instructions, as required. An
IATA checklist, under the Feeding and Watering section was marked "N/A".
Failure to ensure that the shipper provides certification in writing regarding feeding and watering instructions at the
time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment can put the animal at risk. The airline must ensure that the shipper has
provided this information in writing, that this information is clearly visible, and that animals are adequately cared for
while in transit.
To be corrected from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with representatives at the Virgin Airlines cargo office.
