ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:45 PM on
16-Oct-18.
A person at the facility told me that the licensee is usually home by 4:00 pm, but worked late on Tuesdays and
wouldn't be home for over an hour.
