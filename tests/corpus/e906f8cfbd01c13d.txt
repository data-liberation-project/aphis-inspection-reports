ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1430 on
13-Sep-17. I went to the licensee's house. A relative answered the door and informed me the licensee was not
home and she did not know what time he would be home. I told her I would try again some other time.
End of report.
