3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosure for the goats and sheep there is plastic-coated wire fencing has been cut on its edges in a manner
that has left sharp, pointed metal wires protruding into the enclosure. Also there are similar protruding wire ends in
an opening in the fencing in the alpaca enclosure. These wires are sharp and could injure the animals.
Along the back of the goat and sheep enclosure there is a large wood panel that keeps the animals away from the
corner between a wooden shed and the perimeter fence. Whereas other wood panels that sit against the perimeter
fence have been fastened securely with screws, this panel is propped in place by a large piece of cement. The
animals could push behind the panel and topple it, possibly becoming injured in the process.
The enclosures should be free of hazardous items in order to protect the animals from injury.
