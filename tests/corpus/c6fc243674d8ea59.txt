2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***At least eight alpacas were observed to have excessively overgrown hooves. These alpacas had hooves that
were curling abnormally as a result of not receiving adequate routine hoof trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful for the animal or
cause injuries due to a deviation in normal locomotion. As part of the facility’s program of preventative veterinary
care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
These animals must have their hooves trimmed by March 22, 2018 and the rest of the herd must be examined to
assess for overgrown hooves at that time.

WATERING.
***The water in an enclosure containing an adult, female Syrian brown bear, “Polly” was frozen into a solid block of
ice. There was no additional water source in the enclosure for “Polly” to drink out of.
The facility must ensure that all animals are provided with potable water in order to ensure that the animals maintain
adequate hydration. If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as
necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.
The facility corrected this at the time of inspection.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
***There was an accumulation of bird feces in the food and water receptacles in the two black bear enclosures in
Area NE #84 and in eight tiger enclosures in Area NE #85. There was bird feces covering the metal bars that
supported the roof of the enclosures.The presence of pests can cause contamination of the food supply and also lead to health hazards for the animals.
The facility must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote the health and
well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in all animal areas.
