FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** This auction houses animals overnight in stalls that are made panels with wooden lower walls and livestock panel
upper walls. Several stalls housing sheep and goats have holes in the wooden side walls. One was noted with
wires that are broken leaving loose sharp edges pointing into the enclosure. One enclosure wall was found to be
loose from the bottom support and leaning into the enclosure next to it. All animal enclosures are required to be
sound and in good repair. Holes in the side walls of stalls and leaning side walls are a potential hazard for injury or
escape. Broken wires are also an injury hazard. The licensee must ensure a process is in place when erecting
these stalls that they are all in good repair and will properly contain the animals.
