PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
A new caretaker panicked when he observed a marmoset attempting to leave the cage and he closed the door
while the animal was in the doorway inadvertently causing an injury. The incident was immediately reported to the
supervisor and veterinarian. The veterinarian promptly examined the animal but was unable to resuscitate the
marmoset. Personnel working with marmosets must be trained on marmoset behavior and how to appropriately
handle the animals in an escape situation.
Correction: The Standard Operating Procedure for "Marmoset Husbandry and Maintenance" was revised and all
personnel involved in marmoset care were trained on the new procedures. Training emphasized keeping calm and
contacting the supervisor for assistance in the safe return of an escaped marmoset.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
