3.14(c)(1)

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Four puppies arriving at SFO on Korean Airlines flight KE25 with waybill numbers 180-9383-7284, 180-9371-7724, 180-
9388-1841, and 180-9383-7435 did not have an adequate Consignor's Certification statement regarding feeding and
watering. There was no clear info regarding when the puppies were last offered food and water, and no signature from the
consignor with time and date.

Failure to provide feeding and watering instructions clearly displayed on the crate could result in inadequate care for the
puppies especially in the event of delays in transit. Airline must ensure that these requirements are met at the time that
the animals are accepted for transport.
3.17(c)

Food and water requirements.
Four puppies arriving at SFO on Korean Airlines flight KE25 with waybill numbers 180-9383-7284, 180-9371-7724, 180-
9388-1841, and 180-9383-7435 had lixit-type water bottles attached to the exterior of the door of their crates.

Food and water receptacles must be securely attached to the inside of the shipping enclosure, so as to prevent it from


being dislodged during transit. Airline must ensure that these requirements are met at the time that the animals are
accepted for transport.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with airline representatives in the cargo office.
