3.75(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
In the indoor portion of the enclosure containing one, male African green monkey, “Paco,” there is an approximately two
foot area of rust along the bottom of the siding near the animal’s exit door to the outside portion of the enclosure. The rust
has progressed to the point that small holes are developing in the siding, affecting the structural integrity of the enclosure
as well as the ability to effectively clean and sanitize those surfaces. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces that
come into contact with nonhuman primates be free of rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization or affects
the structural strength of any surface.

3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
In the indoor portion of the enclosure containing one, male African green monkey, “Paco,” the feeding platform has an
excessive accumulation of dried feces, food and other debris. The buildup of feces and other debris increases the risk of
disease transmission and attracts pests. The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates
come into contact be spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.84 of this subpart.

3.81

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The Environmental Enhancement Plan for non-human primates is inadequate as it does not address all five primate
species housed at the facility, nor does it address minimum requirements for special considerations such as single
housed primates. There is a singly-housed male, African green monkey, “Paco,” which is unable to see and hear other
non-human primates of its own or compatible species. In addition, the Plan does not include any exemptions by the
attending veterinarian to justify the complete omission of some primates or the single-housing of the African green
monkey.
An inadequate plan of enrichment for nonhuman primates can cause these animals to become highly stressed and/or
bored, affecting their health and overall well-being. The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan
for the enhancement of the environments for each of the primate species housed at the facility, which adequately
promotes the physiological well-being of these animals. This plan must be consistent with professionally accepted
standards and directed by the attending veterinarian.

Facilities, general.
The sheltered portion of an outdoor enclosure containing one, adult male porcupine was not structurally sound or in good
repair. The interior walls were covered in a foam insulation type material, which was crumbly in appearance and broken
in multiple places. The material on the walls could be ingested by the animal and cause illness. Also noted is an
electrical cord for the air conditioning unit positioned in one of the walls, which was hanging down into the enclosure and


accessible to the animal. The cord could be chewed and damaged, posing a danger for electric shock to the animal.
Facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.

Sanitation.
In the food preparation area, the floor under the sink is moist and covered in debris, and there is a yellow film on the walls
near the floor. Premises must be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate husbandry and prevent attraction of vermin
and pests and contamination of food. The licensee needs to establish and maintain an effective method and schedule to
keep the premises, including the food preparation area, clean and sanitary.
