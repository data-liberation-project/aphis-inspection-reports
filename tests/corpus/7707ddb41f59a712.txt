2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* There was no record of inventory present on "unweaned" puppies born at the facility. No inventory information
was attached to five enclosures containing 17 "unweaned" puppies. If any puppy born on the premise has been
recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the enclosure must have the following information attached to it:
dealer's USDA license number, the letters (cid:28) USDA (cid:28) and the number identifying each puppy in that litter. If no
offspring have been recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the following information must be recorded and
attached to the enclosure. The dealer's USDA number, the number identifying each puppy, the date of birth of the
litter, the dam's ID number, a description of each puppy ( breed, sex, color and any distinctive markings ). The
inventory information records must be maintained with all corresponding 7006's for one year. If the licensee
chooses to identify the "unweaned" puppies with official USDA identification ( collar, tattoo or microchip ), then no
inventory information is required on the enclosure. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure that
every puppy's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace all puppies. The licensee must
maintain complete and accurate records of all puppies at all times at their facility. Correct by 4/3/15.
2.75(a)(1)(6)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* USDA APHIS 7005 form ( Record of Dogs on Hand ) has incomplete information on six dogs housed at the
premise. No official identification was listed on these dogs at time of inspection. Complete and accurate records
are needed to ensure each animal(cid:25)s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace dogs.
The licensee must maintain records which fully disclose all information concerning each dog in their possession.
Correct by 4/3/15.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* An estimated one to two inch gap was observed between the fiberglass floor board and the wood board it is
secured to. One dog is in contact with the affected area located on the west side attached runs to the whelp
building. The gap area could potentially allow animal waste, urine or water to collect creating a disease or health
risks. Fiberglass wall board fully covering the entire surface area provides an impervious surface that can be readilycleaned and sanitized. The licensee must repair or replace all surfaces that are worn and cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized on a regular basis. Correct by 3/16/15.
3.6(a)(2)(5)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Additional surface material is needed in eight outdoor enclosures housing 20 dogs. The dirt ground was
estimated to be 40 to 60 percent of the total surface area. Dogs not able to remain dry and clean at all times could
cause discomfort affecting the welfare of those animals. In addition, animal waste being deposited on muddy
surfaces can lead to unsanitary living conditions creating potential health issues. The licensee must ensure that all
outside enclosures be provided with surface material that will allow all the dogs to remain dry and clean at all times.
Correct by 3/16/15.
* Facility inspection done on 3/3/15 and exit briefing done on 3/4/15 were conducted with the licensee.
