3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The whelping area for one adult female Rottweiler and seven Rottweiler puppies was found to have a propane tank
and propane line linked to the heater element on the floor of the enclosure. The heating element was hanging from
the ceiling and was being used at the time of the inspection. This propane tank and line is readily accessible and
could be knocked over or chewed by the adult or puppies. Having this unit be accessible to the dogs in this
enclosure may lead to injury of the animals. Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that
they protect the animals from injury.
