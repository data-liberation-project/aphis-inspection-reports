OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The lemurs and the vervet monkey housed in outdoor enclosures were not provided with sufficient protection from
the cold. The enclosures were equipped with wind breaks and wooden shelter boxes thus providing adequate
protection from certain elements such as the sun, the wind and the rain. However, a heat source was not used to
prevent the ambient temperature within the shelter from falling below 45 °F. The licensee explained that heaters
were not currently being provided because of an electrical problem occurring in that outdoor area. The temperature
outside was 41° F at the time of the inspection and was predicted to drop even lower overnight. At such low
temperatures, non-human primates may experience discomfort and health issues such as frost bite. A system must
be established in order to safely provide heat to prevent the ambient temperature within the shelter from falling
below 45° F.
