2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An approximately 2 year old red female long haired dachshund with no official identification was noticed limping
while moving in her enclosure. Upon closer observation inspectors discovered the dog was missing most of her right
hind leg. Several inches of a large, dry, yellow-brown bone protruded from the red colored tissue at approximately
mid-leg. It appears that all the skin, hair and muscle tissue have been stripped from the bone. The licensee
explained that the dog had gotten into a fight with another dog resulting in the loss of the lower part of the right leg.
It was not clear how long ago this occurred but based on the appearance of the wound we would estimate several
weeks, at a minimum. The licensee also stated that the dog had not been seen or treated by a licensed
veterinarian. The licensee has failed to provide adequate veterinary care for this animal. The licensee called for an
appointment to their attending veterinarian while inspectors were present, and was directed by the veterinarian to
bring the dog in right away. A wound or injury severe enough to cause the extensive damage and tissue loss
suffered by this dog would result in severe pain, distress, and the possibility of death due to shock or secondary
infections. Licensee must ensure that all the dogs at the facility are observed daily and that adequate veterinary
care is provided as needed. The licensee is directed to take this animal to the attending veterinarian by close of
business today, and to follow the veterinarian(cid:25)s treatment recommendations.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The red dachshund female did not have official identification on them at time of facility inspection. The licensee is
using collars as the official identification. The letters USDA, the facility USDA license number and individual
identification numbers are missing on the collars. Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal(cid:25)s
identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs
on the premise have official identification on them at all times. To be corrected by 02-25-2016.
