A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:20-4:10 pm on 07-
SEP-2022. There was a locked gate at the entrance to the property. We honked the car horn. We left messages on the
house phone and the cell phone with no reply. Taped a "Sorry we missed you" notice to the gate.
