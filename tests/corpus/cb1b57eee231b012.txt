SANITATION.
Large amounts of rodent feces and used building insulation are located in the animal room containing 35 guinea
pigs. The rodent feces and insulation are concentrated in a corner of the room (left of the entry door) beneath and
around a hot water heater. The insulation has been/is being used as nesting material for the rodents. Two rodent
traps were observed in the animal room, however, the traps do not appear to be effectively controlling the rodent
population. Rodents can carry and spread diseases that make animals ill.
Implement and maintain an effective pest control program for the rodents at the facility. Remove/clean up the
rodent feces and insulation. Repeat often enough to assure that the rodent control program is effective.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
A strong animal smell was present in the room containing the 10 sugar gliders and 8 degus. The room had a smallfan blowing during the inspection, however, the room still had a strong animal smell. Inadequate ventilation can
lead to increased odors and discomfort of the animals.
Assure that this and all animal rooms are provided with adequate ventilation to provide for the health and comfort of
the animals.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The animal room containing the 10 degus and 8 sugar gliders has food wastes, grime, and debris scattered on the
walls and floors. The areas behind and adjacent to the animal enclosures were affected the worst. Additionally, a
dresser in the room also has food wastes and debris scattered on the front of it. The dresser has a degu enclosure
on top of it. Food wastes, grime, and debris can produce diseases that can make the animals ill.
Thoroughly clean and sanitize the affected areas and repeat as necessary to promote animal health.

3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The facility continues to lack an effective pest control program for rodents. Evidence of rodents in three of the
animal rooms in the facility continues. Rodent feces were observed along the perimeter of the floors, on the window
sills, and behind furniture in these rooms. These rooms contain 10 degus, 8 sugar gliders (room 1), 3 chinchillas, 3
hedgehogs, 2 gerbils (room 2), and 9 ferrets (room 3). The facility owner has several live traps for rodents in place
and indicated that she is cleaning/removing rodent feces from animal rooms frequently. A single mouse was
observed entering and exiting a chinchilla enclosure during the time of inspection. The current pest control methods
for rodents are not working. Rodents can carry and spread diseases that make animals ill.
Implement and maintain an effective pest control program for rodents at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
