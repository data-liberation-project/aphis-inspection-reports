2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
Three male exotic/domestic cats and one female cat were not properly identified. The licensee uses metal tags to identify
the exotic /domestic cats and single cat at the facility. One of the male exotic/domestic cats did not have a metal id tag or
any form of identification. The single cat's identification tag and two of the exotic/domestic cats' identification tags were
fastened to enclosures that didn't contain the animals. Lack of proper identification does not allow for tracking of animals
entering and leaving the facility. All live cats held on the premises, shall be identified by an official tag, tattoo, or
microchip approved by the Administrator.

Primary enclosures.
The carpets inside of three shared indoor enclosures, each containing one exotic/domestic cat and one serval, are
excessively worn and/or can no longer be sanitized. Two of the carpets are located in the newer animal room, inside both
of the shared enclosures. The other carpet is located in the older animal room, inside the largest indoor enclosure.
Additionally, another carpet, located adjacent to the largest indoor enclosure is excessively worn/stained. The staining
and inability to properly sanitize the carpets are a disease hazard to the animals. All surfaces in contact with the animals

must be readily cleaned and sanitized or be replaced when worn or soiled.
