2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown, female fallow deer has an egg shaped mass approximately 5 cm in diameter hanging down from the right
antler bud adjacent to the right eye. The facility records show the attending veterinarian last visited the premises on
July 26, 2017, but there is no mention of this mass on the fallow deer. There is nothing in the facility records to
document this condition or consults with the attending veterinarian to discuss this condition. The fallow deer must be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment, and resolution of the
condition, must be documented and made available to APHIS officials upon request. Correct by September 22,
2017.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength. The chain-link fence separating 2 goats in the second enclosure and 3 goats and 3 kids in the
third enclosure is still bowed and has gaps along the bottom. Two black and white kids housed in the third enclosure
were able to escape under the fence and get out during this inspection. The chain-link fence separating these two
enclosures does not have support bars along the bottom of the fence to prevent the fence from bowing or to prevent
the young goats from escaping their enclosure. Facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair
to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals securely. The bowed fence and gaps under the fence
must still be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals securely. Remains
uncorrected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
