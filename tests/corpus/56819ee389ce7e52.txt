2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the goat and sheep barn, there were at least three goats that had long hooves. These overgrown hooves
caused separation of the medial and lateral portions and turning of the digits of the feet whenever weight was
placed on the feet. There was one brown and white adult goat that had an extremely long medial hoof on the front
left foot. This hoof was curled inward toward the lateral hoof, constantly pushing the lateral digit outward. Hooves
that are left unattended can cause lameness in the animals. The licensee must provide appropriate hoof care to the
animals and ensure that all of the animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.
2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the goat and sheep barn, there was an adult ewe that was heavy bred that had expired. When requested by
the inspector, the licensee removed the ewe from the enclosure. Further observation resulted in the ewe's
extremities being stiff. The licensee stated that the ewe was last seen on the evening of February 18, 2020 before
dark and there appeared to be no problems. No veterinary contact or intervention was taken as the ewe had not
been observed until the inspection. Lack of observation of the animals can lead to the worsening of an onset,
existing condition or death. The licensee must ensure that the animals are observed and relay timely and adequate
information to the veterinarian as required.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The licensee stated that nine sheep were sold since the last inspection. There were no records as to show
documented sale of these animals. Appropriate documentation for acquired and sold animals is essential for proper
identification, tracing forward and trace back of the animal. The licensee must ensure that acquisition and
disposition records are managed for each animal as required.
To be corrected by March 1, 2020.
3.131(c) REPEATSANITATION.
***In the cattle enclosure, there was a portion of the wall of one of the barns that had blown off during a storm that
was leaning against the front portion of the barn and protruding into the enclosure. The portion of the wall was
constructed out of 2 x 4 studs and sheet metal. The licensee stated that the storm was approximately two weeks
ago. Loose metal and boards within the enclosure increases the risk of injury to the animals by creating sharp points
and edges.
***In the cattle enclosure, in the round hay bale rack there was a small amount of old hay and hay netting in the
rack. The licensee removed the netting during the inspection.
***In the goat and sheep enclosure, there were at least two pieces of plastic which a small goat was observed
chewing on one of those pieces. When requested by the inspector, the licensee removed the plastic pieces. Trash
and discarded materials left in the enclosures increase the risk of illness or injury to the animals by presenting the
opportunity for consumption or entanglement. The licensee must remove the trash and discarded from the
enclosures and ensure that the enclosures are free of discarded materials in order to protect the animals as
required.
This inspection began at 1202.
