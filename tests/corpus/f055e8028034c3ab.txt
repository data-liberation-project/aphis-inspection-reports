HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Many of the chain link panels constructing the dog runs had large areas of rust. The surfaces of housing facilities
must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization. These panels need to be
repaired or replaced to remove the rust so that they can be adequately cleaned and sanitized.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several of the cat cages had wood floors and many of the cages had cage furniture made of wood or wood like
material. The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them
to be readily cleaned and sanitized or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. The wooden floors no longer
appear to be impervious to moisture. These should be replaced with a material more easily cleaned and sanitized.
The cage furniture should be treated so that it is impervious to moisture or replaced when necessary to ensure that
it can be adequately cleaned and sanitized.
