PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A heavy accumulation of feces, fur and urine was observed on the lower right corner of a primary rabbit enclosure.
Within the center of matted accumulation of excreta was a hole in the wire bottom floor approximately 2" in
diameter. Primary enclosures need to be maintained in good repair to protect rabbits from injury and to contain
them.
The rabbit was moved to a different cage at the time of inspection. No other rabbits should be housed in this cage
until repairs are completed.
