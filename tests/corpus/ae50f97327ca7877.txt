2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
While speaking to licensee, licensee informed inspector that all but a small amount of his animals are now being housed
at a new site. He has been slowly moving dogs to the new facility over the past several months. USDA APHIS Animal
Care has not yet been notified about the new site. Animals require clean, safe, and secure facilities that provide adequate
shelter for the animals. USDA inspection of new facilities is essential for ensuring facilities meet the regulatory
requirements.
