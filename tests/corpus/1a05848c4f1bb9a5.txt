CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Inside the shelter buildings there were 3 enclosures that had excessive flies in them. Two outdoor enclosures were
observed to have excessive flies. Flies can spread disease that can affect the health of the dogs. One dog was
observed to have numerous fleas on his face, belly, legs and head. Flea bites irritate the dogs' skin and can cause
and spread disease. The owner must establish and maintain an effective pest control program.The inspection and exit interview was done by the inspectors with a facility representative.
