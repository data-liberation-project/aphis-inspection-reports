3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On Monday May 15, 2017 zoo employees found a jaguar out of its enclosure at morning check. The jaguar was
sedated and returned to its holding cage without incident. A spider monkey in the enclosure next to the jaguar
enclosure was injured by the jaguar and had to be euthanized.
The current jaguar enclosure has housed jaguar for many years without an escape. There were no obvious failures
in the construction of the exhibit and it is still unclear exactly how this animal escaped. The current pair of jaguar
are younger animals and may have been able to squeeze through small gaps between wire mesh and metal rods
previous cats could not fit through. However, the jaguar enclosure failed to contain the jaguar and the spider
monkey enclosure failed to protect the monkey from injury.
During this inspection the zoo explained its plans to more securely attach the metal mesh covering the top of the
exhibit to the metal rods along the perimeter of the enclosure.
To be corrected prior to allowing jaguars back into the exhibit.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with zoo personnel.
This was a focused inspection on the jaguar escape.
