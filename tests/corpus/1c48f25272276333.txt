2.31(e)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
One of five protocols reviewed did not contain a rationale for involving animals or for the appropriateness of the species
and numbers of animals to be used. The involved protocol involved a single blood collection in cats with File Number
210001 and was approved by the IACUC 18 May 2021.

Providing such a rationale is essential for the IACUC to review and assure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act in the
appropriate use of animals in research.

All protocols involving use of covered species must contain such a rationale prior to approval.
