2.40(b)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male reindeer named "Holiday" was found to have hooves that are overgrown and in need of trimming. In
particular the back toes are very long, and the dewclaws, both front and back, are excessively long, with the front
ones pressing into the ground. Excessively long hooves and dewclaws can result in injury, discomfort, and/or
lameness.
Appropriate methods and services should be employed in order to provide necessary maintenance of hooves for all
the animals.
This is a repeat citation, having been cited previously in 2013.
