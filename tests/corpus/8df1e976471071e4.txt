ANNUAL REPORT.
Annual report did not include summary of one IACUC-approved exception to the space requirement standard for
multiple pigs. Need to file an addendum to the last annual report to include this summary along with the species
and number of affected animals in order to meet reporting requirements. Correct by May 22, 2014.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
