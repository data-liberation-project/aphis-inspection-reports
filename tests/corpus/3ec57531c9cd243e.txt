PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There was a piece of cloth fabric hung from the fence of an enclosure housing three adult dogs. The adult female
Jack Russell Terrier was entangled around the abdomen in a torn opening in the fabric. The dog was not injured
and its weight was supported by all four of its feet on the ground. The licensee was able to untangle the dog and
removed the cloth fabric immediately from the enclosure.
Materials in disrepair in primary enclosures can lead to injury to the animals. While this animal was not injured in
this instance, the potential of serious, if not fatal results, could occur from hazards, such as this, within the primary
enclosures. Materials used in the primary enclosures must be suitable and be kept in good repair.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: Corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the outdoor enclosure housing three adult Labrador Retrievers the interior floor surface of the shelter had a build
up of brown dirt and grime, and debris. The two enclosures to the north part of the facility housing eight adult small
dogs had green algae on the bottoms of the water pans. The same two enclosures housing the eight adult small
dogs also had a build up of brown greasy residue and dirt on the interior surfaces of both halves of the shelter
structure, and on the exterior wall at the opening of the egress door on the west half of the shelter.
All used primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized once every two weeks, or more often if necessary to
prevent the buildup of dirt, grime and other disease hazards.Used primary enclosures, shelters, and water bowls
must be cleaned, sanitized and maintained in a way to prevent any further buildup of dirt and grime. Licensee must
ensure that all enclosures remain free of accumulations of dirt and grime, and water bowls free of algae in order to
promote the health of the dogs.
