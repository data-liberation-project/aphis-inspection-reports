ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***Inspectors were not able to complete a full inspection on 25 September at 3:00pm. A facility representative was
able to allow inspectors to see the majority of the animals; however, at least 6 foxes were visible but unable to be
inspected more closely because they were in an area that also contained an unfriendly dog. The owner stated later
on the phone that the dog was in this area (rather than freely roaming the property) because he "didn't want him to
bite the UPS man." Additionally, the facility representative did not have access to any of the required records, nor
did she know anything about the facility's operations. An incomplete inspection process is not in compliance with
the AWA. APHIS officials must be allowed to inspect all animals, facilities, and records, and be accompanied by a
responsible and knowledgeable adult available for inspection at least three hours per day, three days per week
Monday-Friday between 7am-7pm.
Correct from this point forward.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
***The majority of the enclosures containing skunks and foxes are excessively dirty, with piles of feces growing
mold and spilled feed on the ground of ground-level enclosures. Dirty conditions cause discomfort to the animals if
they cannot escape contamination and odor; they also attract pests which can transmit infectious disease to the
animals contained therein. Correct by removing excreta and spent feed as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals and minimize disease hazards and odors.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***The premises in general is littered with feces from free-roaming animals (a large number of birds and a miniature
horse). Additionally, the ground beneath elevated primary enclosures is contaminated with piles of feces and spilled
feed. These accumulations of organic matter cause odors and attract pests, which in turn cause discomfort and cantransmit disease to the covered animals. Correct by keeping premises including buildings and grounds clean to
protect the health of the animals.

3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The premises as a whole is infested with flies, such that inspectors were continuously swatting flies away during
inspection. It was also noted that the deer were continuously swishing their tails to keep flies off. This degree of fly
infestation causes discomfort to the animals, as well as poses a risk of disease transmission to the animals. Correct
by establishing and maintaining a safe and effective program for the control of pests (including insects,
ectoparasites, avian and mammalian pests).
