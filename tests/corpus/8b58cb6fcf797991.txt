In the refrigerator, there are two bottles of Enrofloxacin that expired on 09/18/2014 and two bottles of
Chloramphenicol that expired on 07/29/2014 and 10/05/2014. The use of expired medical material is not considered
to be acceptable veterinary practice and may not be effective. The expired medications should either be properly
disposed of or appropriately labeled as expired and moved to a separate location from the non-expired medical
material.
