Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
In December 2020, the IACUC performed it's semiannual review of facilities and protocols but did not submit a report of its
evaluations to the Institutional Official (IO).

IACUC's are required to submit the findings of the semiannual facility and program evaluations to the IO upon completion.
Failure to do so can lead to inaction of any deficiencies or concerns identified by the IACUC, which can negatively impact
animal welfare. Correct by submitting reports of required semiannual reviews of facilities and programs for humane care
and use of animals to the IO.

Recordkeeping requirements.
The facility's IACUC met in December 2020 but no minutes of this meeting were available for review.

IACUC's are required to maintain minutes of IACUC meetings that include records of attendance, activities of the
Committee, and Committee deliberations. Failure to do so can hinder the IACUC's ability to evaluate it's programs as


there is no record of what was discussed or any concerns that were raised, which can negatively impact animal welfare.
Correct by maintaining minutes of all IACUC meetings.
Correct by: July 1, 2021.
