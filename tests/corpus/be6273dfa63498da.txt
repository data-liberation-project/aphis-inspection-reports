ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the last inspection (3-31-14) the inspectors noticed two infant cavies. During this inspection, no infant cavies
were seen in the new cavy enclosure. The facility representative stated that one of the young cavy was found dead
in the old enclosure. The second young cavy has only been seen once by one facility employee since the last
inspection. Food is being left in the old enclosure for the cavy just in case it is hiding in one of the cavy made
burrows. Daily observation of all animals is necessary to assess their health and well-being. Correct from this day
forward.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing two savannah cats contains two igloo type shelters for the cats (one with flap, one without).
Both shelters are dirty with grime covering the surfaces. The inspector walked around behind the enclosure to a
spot directly behind the igloo with the flap. A strong malodor was noted as the igloo was approached. Hard surfaces
with which cats come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized every two weeks to prevent accumulation
of dirt/excreta and reduce disease hazards. Correct by 5/27/14.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A strong malodor was noted behind the savannah cat enclosure. The grey plastic litter box was noted to be dirty on
the outside with small black droppings (pests) on top of it. A large amount of feces was present in the litter box. The
feces inside the litter box was light grey in color and dried up in texture. It appeared that the excreta had not been
scooped out of the litter box within the last day. This was confirmed by the employees. Excreta must be removed
from primary enclosures daily to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and to reduce disease hazards,
insects, pests and odors. Correct by 5/14/14.
3.75(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. The inspector noted that the food storage refrigerator (located outdoors under a lean to portion of the barn-outdoor
temperature in the 80(cid:25)s F today) was not working. Facility maintenance personnel stated they had turned the
refrigerator off an hour ago to do some electrical work. The animal caretaker stated that she had the cleaning of the
refrigerator on her to-do list. The refrigerator was filled with plastic bags of produce. Condensation was present on
the inside of the bags. The shelving was grey brown with dirt. A tan brown liquid was present on the bottom shelf
along with a dirty wet rag and some potatoes. A metal food storage cabinet is present next to the refrigerator. The
doors were open, all shelves were full and open bags of cat feed were on the ground in front of the shelves. Some
of the shelves contained fruit some of which was rotting (apples, grapes) and some of which appeared fresh. An
odor of overripe fruit was noted. A cut sweet potato, with the cut side down, was placed on a dirty, dusty shelf. Open
bags of monkey biscuits were present on the bottom shelf. The top portion of one of the bags was stained and
grimy/oily. Food must be stored appropriately to prevent contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. Food
supplies must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination and vermin infestation
and food requiring refrigeration must be stored accordingly. Correct by 5/15/14.
3.77(c) REPEAT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The sheltered portion of the lemur enclosure has a new light fixture to provide illumination however the bulb was not
working during the inspection. The facility employees are keeping the door open to see inside the sheltered portion
which may allow escape of the lemurs. A facility representative stated that the bulb had burned out and a
replacement bulb was currently not available. The heat lamp is no longer being used due to weather conditions.
There are no other sources of light in the sheltered portion of the enclosure. The sheltered part of the sheltered
lemur housing must be lighted well enough to permit routine inspection and cleaning of the facility, and observation
of the nonhuman primates.
3.80(a)(2)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A new light fixture (normal incandescent light bulb) has been added to the inside of the sheltered portion of the
lemur enclosure to provide light. A light switch for this fixture is present inside the sheltered portion of the enclosure.
The lemurs have access to the light switch, the light fixture (glass cover over bulb) and the red soft coated electrical
cord leading from the switch to the fixture. Non-human primates are curious and may injure themselves when
exploring/playing with the electrical cord and/or the switch. The electrical cord and switch need to be maintained in a
manner that protects the lemurs from injury.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The side and back walls of the new cavy enclosure consist of wooden boards. At the two back corners there is a
gap of 1 ½ to 2 in. where the side wall joins the back wall. On one side wall there is a metal chainlink material gate.Between the wooden boards and the gate on the left side there is a gap of 3 to 5in. These gaps are large enough to
allow other unwanted species to enter the enclosure.
*The addax has damaged a section of its enclosure fencing on the side across from the goats. The damaged
section is where the wire fencing overlaps the wooden board fencing. The wire is damaged with sharp points of
loose wire ends protruding into the enclosure. One of the wooden boards just behind the damaged wire is cracked
down its entire length and is loose. Damaged fencing can lead to injury to the animal and loss of structural integrity
of the fencing.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
An older fallow deer and a muntjac have been moved into the same enclosure since the last inspection. One small
shelter structure is present in the enclosure and during the inspection the fallow deer stayed in the shelter the entire
time. The muntjac was noted lying behind the shelter. The facility employees fed the animals separately placing
food for the deer in front of the shelter opening and a second food receptacle for the muntjac behind the shelter.
Except for the small overhang of the roof of the shelter structure there is no natural or artificial shelter appropriate to
protect the muntjac from storms or other weather events since the deer is not sharing the shelter with the muntjac.
Shelter shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford protection and to prevent discomfort to the animals.
3.130 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
***There are several cavies that have one black plastic water container in their enclosure. The water had a
greenish-brownish tinge with several species of insects floating in the water. The insects have hatched in the water
and are swimming thru-out the water container.
***The water receptacle in the enclosure with the mouflon sheep is almost empty. The bottom of the receptacle is
green with algae. There are feathers, hay and dirt in the remaining water.
Potable water should be available as often as necessary to provide water available for consumption. It is important
to have potable water accessible for the health and comfort of the animal. Direct. Corrected during inspection.
***In the drive-thru park there is a black plastic watering container that has a few cracks with a piece missing on the
top rim of water container. There is a sharp edge present. Water containers should provide potable water without a
risk of injury to the animal. Indirect.
3.131(d) DIRECT
SANITATION. The drive-thru park have deer and elk that were covered with black biting flies causing the animals to bite ,scratch
,kick, shake, and run in order to avoid the black biting flies. Some even went into the water to avoid the black biting
flies. The animals were extremely agitated and when they moved the black biting flies looked like a cloud of black
rising from the animals(cid:25) backs. The owner stated when the inspectors arrived that the flies were starting for the
season and he needed to apply fly treatment product which he currently did not have on hand. The owner needs to
consult the attending veterinarian to develop and implement a pest control program to include flies. In order to avoid
suffering and disease to the animals a safe and effective program shall be established and maintained. The animals
need to be treated by May 14, 2014. The owner needs to consult veterinarian to establish and maintain a pest
control program by May 27, 2014.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
Due to personnel health issues, the animals are currently being cared for by one part time caretaker with experience
and a couple of newly hired employees with no or minimal animal experience. The caretakers and volunteers are
currently not working under a supervisor and are unfamiliar with the Animal Welfare Act regulations /standards and
professional husbandry standards for the animals at the facility. The caretaker is responsible for feeding and
watering but the facility lacks an animal husbandry/curator type person with training and a background in the
standards of care for the animals housed at the facility. This is substantiated by similar issues recurring. Several
repeat citations are documented on inspection reports. The animals have not been treated for flies causing undue
suffering from biting insects. There needs to be a responsible person observing animals daily for possible issues.
Lack of an adequate number of trained employees working under a knowledgeable supervisor can lead to
inadequate care of the animals. The facility shall maintain a sufficient number of trained employees working under a
knowledgeable supervisor to maintain a professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices.
The veterinary care citation cited on March 31, 2014 has been corrected.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
