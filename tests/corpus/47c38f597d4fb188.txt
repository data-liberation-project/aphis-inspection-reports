3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Section 3.129(a) Feeding: Pigs were observed chewing on corn cobs in the mud by the white plastic feeding tube
used by the public to feed the five pigs. The ground under the feeding tube is very muddy. The automatic water
nipple is mounted on a fence post next to the plastic feeding tube. The ground under and around the water source
is muddy from the pigs drinking and playing with the water. Food put in the public feeding tube for the pigs will fall
into the mud. The mud will contaminate the food and be ingested by the pigs. The muddy soil may contain fungal
spores, bacteria and/or parasites that may cause the pigs to become ill when eaten. The food fed by the public
must be free from contamination and not fall into mud to protect the health of the pigs.
