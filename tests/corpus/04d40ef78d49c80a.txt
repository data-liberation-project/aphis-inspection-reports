2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
On January 5th, 2016, Ashley Hoskins was exhibiting Mimi, a grey toy poodle, at the Western Fairs Association
Convention and Trade Show and did not have any of the required paperwork: Acquisition/Disposition records,
Program of Veterinary Care, or Animal Welfare Act License.
Correct from this day forward.
2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
In accordance with 2.126(c) a written itinerary is required to be submitted to the Regional Director at
ACWest@aphis.usda.gov no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate
information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's
approved site. As defined in the regulation, the itinerary shall include the following:
(i) The name of the person who intends to exhibit the animal and transport the animal for exhibition purposes,
including any business name and current Act license or registration number and, in the event that any animal is
leased, borrowed, loaned, or under some similar arrangement, the name of the person who owns such animal;
(ii) The name, identification number or identifying characteristics, species (common or scientific name), sex and age
of each animal; and
(iii) The names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the animals will travel, be housed, and be exhibited,
including all anticipated dates and locations (with addresses) for any stops and layovers that allow or require
removal of the animals from the transport enclosures. Unanticipated delays of such length shall be reported to the
AC Regional Director the next APHIS business day. APHIS Regional offices are available each weekday, except on
Federal holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
As a Class C exhibitor with no reported primary site, submitting an itinerary for the traveling animals is crucial to
ensuring that the animals are maintained in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. Ashley Hoskins brought
"Mimi" the toy poodle to the Western Fair Association Convention and Trade Show in Anaheim, CA Jan 3-6, 2016. There have been no itineraries submitted to the Regional Director or ACWest@aphis.usda.gov in 2015 or 2016.
Licensee stated that she has an overwintering site in Arizona, and an alternative site in San Diego County and
neither address has been reported to the Regional Director or ACWest@aphis.usda.gov. These addresses and
the dates when the animals are at each site must be reported in advance to the Regional Office in order to facilitate
Animal Welfare Act Inspections.
Itineraries must be submitted to the Regional Director with the required information no fewer than 2 days in advance
of any travel or move. Exhibitors who repeatedly provide less than 48 hours(cid:25) notice will be subjected to increased
scrutiny under the Act.
To be Corrected from this day forward.
