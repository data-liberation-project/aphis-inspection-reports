2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30 AM on
06/26/2014. An individual at the property said the registrant was out of town. I called the phone number on file and
left a message.
