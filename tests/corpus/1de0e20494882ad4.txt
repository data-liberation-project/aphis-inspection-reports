Sitting on the floor inside the Veterinary Clinic/Whelping Building is an open bag of wood shavings being utilized in
the pans below the enclosures for adult dogs with puppies and weaned puppies. Open bags of wood shavings that
are being stored on the floor create an opportunity for contamination and vermin infestation. Ensure that all
supplies of food and bedding are stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage, contamination and vermin
infestation.
