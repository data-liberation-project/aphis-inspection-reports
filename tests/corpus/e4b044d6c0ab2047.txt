2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
In 2022, the facility exhibited three captive possums to the public without a USDA license. A valid USDA license is
necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and the public and to comply with the federal Animal
Welfare Act. The facility must apply for and obtain a USDA license or discontinue regulated activities.

No regulated activities may be conducted until a USDA license is obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and NC Wildlife Resources Commission
personnel.
