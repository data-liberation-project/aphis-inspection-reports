overflowing on the ground near the enclosures. The build up of feces and urine is creating a strong odor and is an
attractant for pests that may harm the animals. More frequent cleaning of toughs and collection buckets will prevent
the odor. Troughs must be cleaned at least weekly.

discarded items and debris stacked in these areas . A truck is being repaired next to the animal pens. Allowing trash
and items not related to the daily care of the animals to collect near animal housing create a habitat for pests which
may harm the animals. Materials used in the truck repair are a hazard for animals if they are spilled or leak.
Accumulations of trash and items not related to animal care must be kept away from animal housing areas to
protect the health of the animals.
