Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult Aoudad sheep was observed on inspection with a left-forelimb, weight-bearing lameness. The sheep was seen
separated from its herd on several occasions, and reluctant to move while the remainder of the herd willingly moved freely
throughout the enclosure. When the abnormal gait and presentation was identified during the inspection, the facility stated
the lameness hadn’t been noted prior to today’s inspection.

Lameness is suggestive of pain and/or underlying disease. Failure to observe all animals daily can result in deterioration
of the animal's health, especially when limping has began, and the initial onset is unknown. Daily observation of all
animals shall be done to assess their health and well-being. Timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being noted during daily observations must be communicated to the attending veterinarian so
that appropriate veterinary care can be provided.

To be corrected by April 30, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representative.
