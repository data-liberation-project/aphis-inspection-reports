2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the auction of three kinkajous (numbers 043-045) the owner removed one of the kinkajous from its enclosure
(made mostly of wood with one side of wire mesh material). The owner grabbed the kinkajou by the tail as the
kinkajou struggled to get away. The kinkajou got loose and leapt across the table and five feet of space attempting
to land on a wooden dog house type structure nearby. The kinkajou did not make it to the top of the structure
instead hitting a side of it, falling and landing on its back on the ground. The kinkajou then got up and made several
more leaps among objects and spectators inside the auction ring until the owner caught it and placed it back into its
enclosure. Handling of all animals during the auction must be done only if it can be done in a manner that does not
cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort in order to ensure the health and
well-being of the animals. Correct from this day forward.
3.36(e)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
Six enclosures (numbers 023-028) each housing between 2 and 4 guinea pigs measured 5 1/4 inches high. A layer
of hay in the enclosures minimized the interior height available for the guinea pigs even more. Some guinea pigs
were noticed standing hunched over as they did not have adequate interior height to hold their head up in a normal
position. Adequate interior height is necessary to allow the guinea pigs freedom of movement and the ability to
stand and move normally. The interior height of guinea pig enclosures shall be at least 6 inches for guinea pigs
weighing up to 500 gms and at least 7 inches for guinea pigs weighing over 500 gms. Correct from this day forward.
3.36(e)(1)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
Two enclosures (number 024 housing four guinea pigs and number 027 housing three guinea pigs ) did not provide
the minimum required floor space for the guinea pigs. The floor space of each enclosure measured 6inx10in for a
total floor space of 60 sq.in. A large amount of hay in the enclosures minimized the available floor space even more.
Guinea pigs weighing up to 350 gm each require 30 sq in of floor space. Thus the three guinea pigs will require 90
sq. in. and four guinea pigs will require 120 sq. in. Adequate floor space is required to allow freedom of movement
and to allow the guinea pigs space to get away from each other. Guinea pigs shall be transported in an enclosurethat shall provide a minimum of floor space depending on the weight of the guinea pig (30 sq. in. up to 350gm., 45
sq. in. up for 350-600gm., and 60 sq. in. for guinea pigs over 600 gm.) Correct from this day forward.
3.36(f)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
One guinea pig enclosure (025) housing two guinea pigs did not have enough clean, absorbant litter in it on Sat.
5/10/14. Water and excreta wastes had accumulated in excess of what the hay could absorb leaving the bottom of
the cage wet. The feet of the guinea pigs were wet. Hair on the underside of the guinea pigs also appeared damp.
Enough clean, absorbant litter is necessary to keep the animals clean and dry to avoid discomfort and potential
injury. Enclosures shall contain clean litter of a suitable absorbent material in sufficient quantities to absorb and
cover excreta. Correct from this day forward.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Nine zebu were being housed in one large rectangular shaped enclosure in the far back of the covered portion of
the barn. A large piece/section of railed metal livestock panel was located about 3 ft inside of one of the narrow
ends of the enclosure. It was upright but leaning in toward the animals at about a 45 degree angle. A piece of green
twine was being used to tie up/hold up one end of this panel to one wall of the enclosure. This panel could easily fall
if bumped or run into by one of the zebu leading to potential injury of the zebu. Housing facilities shall be structurally
sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct from this day forward.
