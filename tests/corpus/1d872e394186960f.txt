PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are three free-standing whelping enclosures constructed with plastic-coated wire floors where the plastic
coating has worn off of at least 30% of the flooring. Bare wire flooring may be uncomfortable for the puppies and
may cause foot problems. All suspended flooring must be either 1/8" in diameter or be coated with plastic or
fiberglass. Correct by 29 October 2015.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative. Also in attendance was a
KDA inspector.
