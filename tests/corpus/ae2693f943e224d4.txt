Requirements and application.
Mr. Satterfield is operating as a dealer without a valid USDA Animal Welfare Act license. On Friday September 9th, 2022
he consigned and sold, without a valid license, the following animals at the Triple W Alternative Livestock auction in
Cookeville Tennessee: two opossums (auction tags 6512 and 6513), two bobcats (6510 and 6511) and two grey squirrels
(1614 and 1615).
A valid license is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and to comply with the Animal Welfare Act
and Regulations.
The facility needs to obtain a USDA license or discontinue regulated activities.

NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative at the auction.
