chewed wooden trim must be replaced to protect the animals from injury and to maintain the window in good repair.
2. One of the fluorescent light fixtures, in the non-human primate enclosure, has detached from the ceiling and is
no longer adequately secured. This dangling fixture must be repaired and adequately secured to prevent the fixture
from falling and causing injury to the non-human primates housed therein.

injured.
