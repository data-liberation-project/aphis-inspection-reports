2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
When the inspectors started this inspection they noticed a cavy that was not putting any weight on its right front leg.
It held the leg up off the ground even when sitting still. The caretaker stated that she has already called the
veterinarian and expects the vet this afternoon. During the rest of the inspection of the inspection three more
animals were noted in need of veterinary care. The facility representative with inspectors was unaware of these
issues and no records were available for review. One brown and white llama was noticed with its mouth open at all
times. Saliva was drooling from its mouth. A thin piece of a light brown material such as a thick piece of straw or
very thing branch appeared to be protruding from the tongue. A female elk had a raised red area about 4inx5in on
her left lower side. A female black and white goat with a newborn kid has an abnormal bowed out appearance to her
front legs along with thickened, curved abnormal hooves. She walks with a stiff, short stepping gait. The veterinarian
needs to evaluate these four animals to ensure a diagnosis and treatment plan is instituted. Correct by Dec. 14,

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
The inspectors noted several rats in the primary enclosures of the muntjac, African crested porcupine, and the
goats. The animals' shelter structures have visible rat holes underneath them. It is important for the health and well
being of the animals to make sure rats that may carry disease are controlled. The facility representative stated that
they are using a rat trap and are catching rats however it appears that that is not enough to control this rat
population. A safe and effective written program for rat control that has been approved by the attending veterinarian
to ensure safety for the animals shall be established and maintained. Correct by Jan. 12, 2017.
