3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The indoor building for the gibbon needs to be addressed. The walls inside the enclosure are no longer sealed
with paint flaking off, allowing the concrete to maintain moisture in the walls. This is adding to high humidity in the
building and a strong musty odor. Additionally, there is a metal support beam in the enclosure that is rusted with rust
flaking off the beam. These surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis to facilitate cleaning for the gibbon.

*** In the Capuchin outdoor enclosure on the hill, there is a wooden spool that has deteriorated in a corner and has
rusted bolts exposed. This spool should be removed to prevent potential injury to the animals and to facilitate
cleaning of the enclosure.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** Several of the enclosures have an accumulation of feces that needs to be removed. There was a large
accumulation of feces in the cougar shelter that has not been removed in a few weeks. This contributed to a strong
odor in the shelter area. In addition, the llama barn had an accumulation of feces in the main hallway of the barn.
One llama when it moved out of the barn had been lying in feces and had dirty fur on the left rear leg. These areas
need to be cleaned as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors and contamination to the
animals.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
*** The llama barn and enclosure needs to be addressed. A section of temporary fence was down which allowed the
llamas access to some broken pallets with nails protruding upward. This could be a safety hazard if the llamas wereto walk on or near the broken boards. In addition, several of the stalls in the barn have various items and one stall
was open and littered with discarded items such as boards, wires, tools, concrete blocks etc. These stalls, the barn
and outdoor enclosures should be kept clean and trash items placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary
to protect the health of the animals.

*** In the Elk and deer enclosure, there is an old dilapidated building structure off the ground supported by a
concrete slab. Around the area there is evidence of broken glass from old bottles and possibly the building. This
structure should be removed from the area to so that it does not become a potential hazard to the animals as it
degrades further.
