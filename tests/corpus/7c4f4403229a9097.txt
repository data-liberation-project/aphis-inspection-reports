HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Condition and site.
There is dusty wooden furniture, small dog figurines and other stored material in the whelping area. Housing
facilities and areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste
material, junk and other discarded materials. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of
clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored material, but may contain materials actually used and necessary
for cleaning the area, and fixtures or equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices. Keeping the premises
clean and free of clutter is necessary to ensure the health and well-being of all dogs. Licensee must remove any
items that are not necessary to have in the whelping area.

3.2(d) REPEAT
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Interior surfaces.
The floors and walls of indoor housing facilities, and any other surfaces in contact with the animals, must be
impervious to moisture. The ceilings of indoor housing facilities must be impervious to moisture or be replaceable
(e.g., a suspended ceiling with replaceable panels).The whelping area is located in a utility room and storage room.
The walls and ceilings of this room have not been made impervious to moisture. The walls are constructed of rock
and the ceiling is comprised of wood. Further, the wooden support poles within enclosures have not been made
impervious to moisture and have been chewed by the dogs.Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture and in
contact with the dogs can soak up water, urine, and other liquids. This can increase disease risks and odor levels.
Other walls not in contact with the dogs and the ceiling in this area cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized to
minimize disease risks and odor levels or stop the spread of a contagious disease outbreak should it occur. The
walls, support poles, and ceiling in this room must be made impervious to moisture.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee at time of inspection.
