ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0945 on
02-MAY-17.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the front door and called the contact number provided. The licensee
answered my call and stated that she was not home and that she was unable to return home at that time. I then
left the facility.
End of report.
