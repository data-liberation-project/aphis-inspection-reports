Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Both the July and December semi-annual reports sent to the Institutional official (IO) contain a letter describing recent
IACUC activity but do not include a program review. Both reports are also missing minority views or a statement indicating
that there were none.

In the July semi-annual facility report, “Need to be adjusted” is written as the correction for all deficiencies and not specific
plans. While in the December facility report, the plan for correction is written but the deficiencies are not clearly described.

The semi-annual evaluation report to the IO is an important document that updates the IO on the status of the facility's
animal care and use program and allows the IO to know when to intervene to ensure that the facility meets the federal
guidelines. At least once every 6 months, the IACUC must inspect all the animal facilities, including animal study areas,
and must review the program for humane care and use of animals. The report of such review must contain a clear
description of identified deficiencies, the significance of the deficiency (significant or minor), a reasonable and specific
plan for correcting the deficiency and a correct by date. The semi-annual evaluation report also needs to include any
minority views.


2.31(d)(1)(ii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Approved protocol VETY 3844 includes surgical procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or
distress to the dogs and cats. The principal investigator (PI) did not consider alternatives to the painful surgical
procedures and thus did not provide a written narrative describing that alternatives were not available. A thorough
alternative search is important in order to identify options for replacement, reduction or refinement of animal use in pursuit
of the minimization of animal pain and distress. The IACUC shall determine that the principal investigator has considered
alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals and that the PI
has provided a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not
available. To be corrected by April 30th, 2023.
2.31(d)(1)(iii) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocols VETY 3934, VETY 3924 and VETY 2893 do not provide assurance from the investigator that the activities do
not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments. This information must be included in order for the IACUC to verify that
the animals are being used in a judicious manner and the use of animals is not unnecessarily duplicative. This assurance
needs to be provided for proper IACUC review and approval.
2.31(e) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Many important aspects were missing or confusing in the protocols:
- Protocols VETY 3934, VETY 3924, VETY 2893, VETY 2854 and VETY2873 do not provide a rationale for the number of
animals to be used.
- Protocols VETY2803, and VETY3844 justifies the number of animals to be used based on the number of animals


needed per session and the total number of sessions per semester.
o However, for these two protocols, there is some confusion as to what is needed as a different number of animals to
be used is indicated at different sections. In protocol VETY2803, section III B indicates that 48 animals will be needed for
the semester, while section IV A indicates 32 will be used for the study. In protocol VETY3844, section III B indicates 56
animals will be needed for the semester, while section IV A indicates 22 will be used.
o Further confusion arises from the fact that for both these protocols, in section III B, the calculation done using the
justification provided does not result in the total number identified in the protocol. For example, protocol 2803, with 3 to 4
animals per session and 7 weeks per semester, 21 to 28 animals should be needed. However, the protocol in that
section, indicates that 48 animals will be needed for the semester.
o Both these protocols, as well as protocol 2824, do not separate the rationale for the number of animals per species
and do not provide a rationale for the number of animals needed per session.
With so much confusion in the protocols surrounding the rationale for the number of animals, the IACUC cannot
determine if too many or not enough animals are being used in order to optimize animal health and comfort.
- Protocols VETY 2854 and VETY 2873 do not provide a complete description of the proposed use of the animals. Only a
short, concise general goal is provided but not a complete description of animal use.
o In protocol VETY2854, the abstract section mentions doing vaccinations while section V indicates that no
immunizations will be done. The principal investigator (PI) explained that horses will be vaccinated for routine diseases
but that is not described in the protocol. Further confusion arises from this protocol in section VI where information is
provided, such as the anesthesia regimen, for non-study related procedures while section V indicates no surgical
procedures will be done for this study. The PI explained surgical procedures are not a regular part of the study but only
done when medically needed.


o Protocol VETY 2873, indicates that no pharmacologic materials will be used. Yet the PI explained that some animals
will be sedated while others will be under general anesthesia for this study but this is not described in the protocol.
- Protocol VETY 3924 does not provide the method of euthanasia to be used if necessary.

Without the required information regarding animal usage, the IACUC cannot assess how the animals will be used and
cared for and therefore cannot make an informed decision in approving the protocols. The facility was cited during the last
inspection for protocols missing the same information. Some of the protocols were amended but, much of the information
is still missing. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure protocols are complete and contain all of the required
information before approval. Protocols describing the conduct of activity involving animals must contain all of the required
information for proper IACUC review and approval.
2.36(b)(5)

Annual report.
There are items missing in the fiscal year 2022 annual report:
o The report indicated 7 dogs were used during that fiscal year while the facility’s animals on hand record shows 10 dogs
for that time period. In addition, the last USDA inspection report from January 2022, within the fiscal year, documents 9
dogs present during inspection.
o The report indicated that 4 rabbits were used while the last USDA inspection report documents 7 rabbits present during
inspection.
o The report also did not include the cows, goats and horses used to teach veterinary technician students.
A facility representative explained not understanding that disposed animals during the fiscal year also needed to be part
of the animal count.
Properly identifying species and numbers of animals held and/or used for teaching or research is necessary to inform the


IO and USDA Animal Care of the scope of animal use at the facility. The Fiscal year 2022 annual report needs to be
amended and resubmitted to the Regional Office with all animal data included. Correct by April 20th, 2023.
3.26(a)

Facilities, indoor.
The log in the guinea pig room for the month of February disclosed that the temperature for the last 7 days remained in
the mid to low 60s. On February 3rd 2023, the temperature in the room housing 7 guinea pigs was 58.5°F. A facility
representative explained experiencing some difficulty with the heating system in the building for a couple of months now.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress which may negatively impact
their health or cause discomfort. Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must be sufficiently heated to protect the animals
from the cold, and to provide for their health and comfort. The ambient temperature shall not be allowed to fall below 60
°F. To be corrected by February 17th, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
