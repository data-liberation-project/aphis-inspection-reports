WATERING.
The water tanks for the goats and pig were dry and an automatic float valve for a tank had been dislodged from a
tank so that the tank was not being filled automatically. It is not clear if the person responsible for watering the
hoofstock did so this morning or not. Lack of water can cause animal discomfort and doesn't maintain optimum
animal health. Ensure that an adequate amount of water for the species is provided to animals at all times.
Note: A person at the facility immediately provided water for the animals during inspection.
Maintain correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
