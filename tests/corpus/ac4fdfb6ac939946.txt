2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records need to be documented, maintained and kept currant at all times. During this inspection it was noted that
the new record system that this facility has implemented did not contain all of the required information. The name,
address, USDA #, or Drivers license # & Vehicle Plate #'s, and dates of animal transactions need to be
documented. At this time the acquisition, disposition and birth dates were not in the records. Also the animals that
were born on the premise were not documented as such. All records need to be kept currant and accurate.
***To Be Corrected By: Oct 3, 2015
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
