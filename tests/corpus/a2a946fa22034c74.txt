2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
**The facilities' records required by the Animal Welfare Act, specifically the Program of Veterinary Care, was not
available for review at the time of inspection. Unavailability of records does not allow APHIS officials to review the
Program of Veterinary Care and evaluate whether the facility is following the program to ensure adequate veterinary
care is being provided. The facility must maintain records as required by the Animal Welfare Act and ensure they
are available at all times for review.
