2.40(a)(1) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, there is no written program of veterinary care. A written program of veterinary care is required to
ensure that there is an expectation about the care provided to all animals. Failure to establish and maintain a written
program of veterinary care can decrease the ability to ensure optimal care of the animals. A written program of veterinary
care must be established and maintained so that the licensee has a plan for providing adequate preventative care and
treatments as necessary.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee does not have records of acquisition for one alpaca and one Patagonian cavy, and does not have disposition
records for six domestic goats, two zebu, nine donkeys, five sheep, one capybara, 14 llamas and one pig. Records
containing the required information for animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including those
offspring born on premises, are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use. The licensee
shall make, keep and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully and correctly disclose the
required information.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.


In the enclosure containing one axis deer, three cattle, two bison, two zebu and one pig, there is a rusted, tubular frame
attached to the fence with wire. The wire is twisted and cut so that the points could come into contact with the animals.
In an enclosure containing two pigs, there is chicken wire twisted around the fencing which poses a risk for injury of
entrapment of the animals.
In the enclosure behind the house to which one kangaroo has access, there is sagging chicken wire with sharp points
attached to the rear fence that could come into contact with the animal.
Loose wire and sharp points pose a hazard for animals. All enclosures must be constructed and maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury.
