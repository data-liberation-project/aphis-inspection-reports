ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:00PM on
02-May-19.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 4:45PM. I knocked on the door of the residence and was answered by a
younger male. When questioned about the presence of Brad or Stephanie he informed me that neither were home
and he did not expect them for a while. I told him I had their cell phone numbers and I would try calling them.
Sitting in my vehicle on the driveway I called and left a message on Stephanie's phone. And then did the same on
Brad's phone. Within a short period of time Stephanie called me back and confirmed that both her and Brad were
working late that evening and would not be home for a while.
