FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During inspection, the outdoor enclosures for one male Grevy'(cid:25)s zebra, two Dexter cows, and six Jacob(cid:25)s
Four-Horned sheep had multiple areas of loose sharp metal wires. Most of the loose wires were from 2 in. by 2 in.
metal fencing used to patch holes in the main fencing and gates. The wires ranged from being a quarter inch in
length to several inches and most were sharp to the touch. The wires are not only sharp which can injury the
animal(cid:25)'s mouth and skin but can also be possibly ingested. Additionally, the loose fence wires do not provide a
structurally sound enclosure. The housing facilities must be in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.
