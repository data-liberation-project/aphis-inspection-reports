FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Indoor Housing Facilities.
***The indoor swine pens are made from polycarbonate panels attached to metal vertical posts. Several of the front
panels and a few of the side panels between adjacent pens were noted to be cracked or have broken edges. The
cracked or damaged panels swayed back and forth a few inches whenever a pig jumped up against them. The
cracked and broken-edged panels affect the structural strength of the pens and the broken edges of the panels
could cause an injury to the pigs.
Per this Section of the Regulations, indoor housing facilities must be constructed of such material and of such
strength as appropriate for the animals involved. In addition, indoor housing facilities shall also be structurally
sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The Licensee needs to repair or replace the polycarbonate panels for the safety and health of the animals and to
ensure that the housing facilities are maintained in good repair.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Drainage.
***Many of the pigs are given access to an outdoor pen daily. There is a pie-shaped mud wallow inside the outdoor
pen that is along the front side of the pen and is also adjacent to the entry/exit gate for the pen. The mud in the
wallow was a watery soup-like consistency and measured 2” deep. The pigs must walk through the watery mud
wallow in order to enter or exit the outdoor pen. Exposure to this type of wet conditions can result in foot and/or
hoof problems in the animals.Per this Section of the Regulations, a suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water and
provide adequate drainage.
The drainage in the outdoor pen needs to be improved and/or the outdoor pen’s entry/exit gate needs to be
re-located to an area of dry ground so the pigs do not have to walk through the excess water/watery mud in order to
enter or exit the outdoor pen. This is important to ensure the health and comfort of the animals.
