Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During inspection, the following were found:
• One hamster was seen to have an excessively swollen red right eye that it could not open. The entire right side of his
face was also swollen.
• In two separate enclosures, two different hamsters appeared unthrifty, underweight and each with a wet belly and tail
trying to clean themselves of the wetness/discharge.
• A thin unthrifty robo dwarf female hamster was found lying on its side not moving in the back of the enclosure. Once
roused, she stood unmoving with her eyes closed appearing dull and lethargic.
• One unthrifty dwarf hamster was found in a corner at the back of an enclosure with a mostly hairless face and
reddened/crusty skin underneath.
• A teddy bear hamster with approximately 50 percent of its hair missing appeared thin and unkempt.
• A black and white female rabbit housed singly in an enclosure was noted to have increased respiratory effort with yellow
nasal discharge and yellow crust present around her right eye.
• 22 hamster enclosures were found to have cannibalism occurring in them. One enclosure had a hamster that was
actively being cannibalized while it was still alive and another enclosure had active cannibalism of a recently deceased


hamster. Two enclosures had approximately 8 pieces of deceased hamster with 7 alive hamsters remaining. One
enclosure had a recently deceased hamster located under the feed bin. Another enclosure had deceased hamster pieces
in the feed bin on top of the pellets for consumption and in the bedding material as well. The rest of the enclosures had
varying amounts of deceased hamster pieces in the enclosures with the remaining alive hamsters.
The conditions affecting these animals were not identified by the licensee, therefore the veterinarian had not been
contacted and care had not yet been provided. Failure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment and
causes undue pain and distress in animals with conditions such as these listed here. A more rigorous method of daily
observation of all animals must be implemented in order to properly assess their health and well-being. Direct and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for timely diagnosis and adequate medical attention.
The animals identified during this inspection noted above were taken by the licensee for veterinary assessment and care
at the time of the inspection.

Facilities, general.
4 hamster enclosures were found to have full thickness cracks in the plastic enclosure from the base up the side to the
top. There was enough of a gap for a body part of a hamster to slip through and get injured or in some cases escape
could occur.
Injury can occur from falls while escaping through the cracks or from exposure to the sharp edges of the plastic. All
primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair and must properly contain the animals. Additionally, ensure worn
enclosures are replaced when necessary.

Sanitation.
Some areas, mainly near the feed storage area, was in need of cleaning:
• Spilled pellet feed that was soft and covered with green fuzz was noted on the floor underneath the storage rack for
pelleted feed.
• At a storage pallet, spilled cut carrots were found on the ground between a pallet and storage rack. A few pieces of the
cut carrots appeared black and had attracted flies.
• Along the wall that stored feed, below a wheeled ladder, two rodent corpses were found that were dry and flattened.
Accumulations of spilled feed and debris can lead to attraction of vermin/pests that can lead to the spread of disease to
the animals. Premises shall be kept clean and shall remain free of accumulations of trash, deceased rodents and spilled
feed.

Watering.
10 female gerbils, housed in the same enclosure, appeared thin, unthrifty, and unable to reach their water lixit due to its
height in the enclosure. Upon placing a stainless steel step in the enclosure below the waterer to allow access, all the
gerbils ran to the corner with the waterer and drank voraciously.
The gerbils had no other access to water other than the one water lixit that was too high for them to reach. This lack in
water access severely impacted the welfare of these gerbils as evidenced by their unkempt appearance. Providing
sufficient quantity and access to water is important for their comfort and health. All water receptacles must be accessible
to all the animals in an enclosure.

Care in transit.
Hamster enclosures on a ground transport vehicle preparing to leave on a six hour journey were stacked on a pallet that
were 7 enclosures high, 3 enclosures across and 4 enclosures deep wrapped loosely in a mesh material. The driver
stated they stop and visually check the animals once every hour but the 2 center stacks composed of 14 enclosures could
not be observed since the pallets would not be unloaded during those checks. Therefore, during transport, the animals in
the center enclosures could not be assessed for signs of physical distress, to determine if any veterinary care was
needed, or to assess the ambient temperature in the center.
Not having access to the center enclosures on the pallet does not allow for sufficient observation of the animals for signs
of distress or injury.
All animals should be observed in the ground transportation vehicle at least once every 4 hours.

Handling.
Many hamster transport enclosures were stacked in an unstable manner on the loading dock prior to departure. The
transport enclosures were stacked six enclosures high (each enclosure containing 10 hamsters), in a manner that was
stacked off center and unevenly as the stack got higher and was swaying slightly in the breeze of a large fan that was
present on the loading dock. The enclosures were stacked in a manner which may reasonably be expected to result in
their falling.
During the inspection, an employee was seen picking up hamster transport enclosures to stack on the loading dock only
using one handle which caused the enclosures to tilt almost vertically and roughly putting them into place. The licensee
addressed the employee immediately for correction.
Stacking enclosures in a manner that could result in a fall and improper handling of transport enclosures can cause


additional stress and/or injury to the animals inside.
The licensee must ensure that the animal enclosures will be properly stacked and handled in the future.
