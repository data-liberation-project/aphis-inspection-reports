HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At time of inspection all outdoor enclosures of the tan building housing twenty five adult dogs have holes dug in the
dirt floor. The holes range in size from six inches to two feet in depth and a foot to three feet in circumference. Some
of the holes are located next to the enclosure fencing between the pens. Some holes are dug back underneath the
concrete allowing rough edges to be exposed. The holes are large enough that a dog could become entrapped if
concrete cracks and collapses into the hole or if the dirt collapses. This affects the ability of enclosure flooring to
contain the dogs securely. It could lead to potential injury if the dogs try to escape under the fencing or if material or
dirt collapses affecting the safety and health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure all enclosure dirt flooring is kept
in good repair to protect the dogs from injury and contain the dogs securely at all times. To be corrected by
