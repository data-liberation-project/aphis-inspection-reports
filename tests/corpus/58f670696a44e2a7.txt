2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
The facility is operating a seasonal pumpkin patch which includes an exhibit featuring USDA regulated animals (a zebra
and a dromedary camel). A USDA official purchased a ticket and walked through the facility, where members of the public
were present viewing the animals. The USDA official then introduced themselves to the facility owner and stated that the
facility needs a USDA license to exhibit animals such as zebras and camels. The facility owner stated that she tried to
apply for a USDA license last year after she was contacted by USDA, but was unable to complete the application online.
The USDA official stated that an inspection report and paper application would be delivered by mail.
A USDA license is required to exhibit exotic animals including zebras and camels.
No regulated activities may be conducted until a USDA license is obtained.

This inspection was conducted by purchasing a ticket and walking through the facility unannounced. The exit interview
was conducted with the facility owner.
