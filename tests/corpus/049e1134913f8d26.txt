3.6(b)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**No shelves or perches were found in the enclosures housing several cats. Primary enclosures housing cats
should have resting surfaces that are elevated, impervious to moisture, easily cleaned and/or replacable. It is the
responsibility of the facility to ensure enclosures housing cats have appropriate resting surfaces to allow for normal
postural movements and behaviors in order to promote the health and well-being of the animals.
