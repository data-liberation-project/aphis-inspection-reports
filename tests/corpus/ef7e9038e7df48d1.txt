2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A protocol involving sheep that was approved by the IACUC did not completely list all procedures that were
performed and potential side effects of the pulmonary function tests. These tests were performed 20 times on 13
lambs from January to April 2017.
Failure to include all procedures and potential side effects does not allow the IACUC to undertake a complete and
thorough review of animal use to ensure humane care and use of animals.
The protocol was amended and has since been been renewed and approved by the IACUC to include all testing
procedures, potential side effects and steps to take to reduce risk and manage/treat side effects.
Corrected prior to the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives on 5/24/18.
