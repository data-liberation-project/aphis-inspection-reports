AV clinical notes for a male lion named Batman, which were unavailable until after the inspection of 7/22/14,
indicate that on 3/19 /14 he was observed to have his right third eyelid elevated and the eye half closed and
drainage present. On 3/21/14 it is noted that the third eyelid is even more elevated and the eye more closed. The
AV notes do not state whether these observations were made by her or someone else. On 3/26/14 the AV clinical
notes did indicate that she observed the animal in person. According to her notes the (cid:28)eye was open to almost
normal position(cid:29) and (cid:28)there was minimal drainage(cid:29). She also noted the lion (cid:28)appeared weak in the rear and slightly
favored the right rear leg(cid:29). The lion was given 5 cc Pen G but no diagnostics appear to have been done at that time.
From 3/27/14 until 4/5/14 the lion received intermittent Pen G injections. On 4/3/14 the AV noted the licensee
communicated to the AV that the lion was (cid:28)showing strange movements(cid:29).
On 4/5/14 the AV visited the facility and observed the lion. She notes (cid:28)the eye is much improved(cid:29) but he (cid:28)appears
weak and somewhat uncoordinated in the rear(cid:29). The AV noted the licensee (cid:28)decided he did not want further
diagnostics or treatment(cid:29).
The AV also noted (cid:28)we expect his neurologic condition to deteriorate and Tim plans on euthanizing with a gunshot
to the head when Batman(cid:25)s quality of life is no longer adequate(cid:29).
This AV resigned as of the end of April, 2014.
On 5/1/14 a contract with a new AV was entered into by the facility but as of 8/5/14 a formalized plan of veterinary
care by the new AV had not been finalized and signed. The new AV did state that she had read the previous AV(cid:25)s
clinical notes concerning Batman but as of 8/5/14 the new AV had not addressed Batman(cid:25)s condition or alter the
method of euthanasia.*****The licensee is responsible for ensuring appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases
and injuries are provided to resident animals. The licensee failed to ensure appropriate care was given to this
animal by failing to allow the previous AV to carry out diagnostics and possible treatments. The licensee failed to
ensure appropriate care was given by not requesting the new AV evaluate the animal immediately. This lion is only
11 or 12 years old. With adequate veterinary care it could possibly live for several more years.

***** ***** On 5/1/14 the facility entered into an agreement with a new veterinarian to become the facility attending
veterinarian. As of the 8/5/14 inspection a plan of veterinary care developed for the facility by the new AV and
facility was unavailable for review as it had not been completed. The new AV during a visit on 8/5/14 indicated she
would have one finalized by the week of 8/11/14.
This formalized plan of care for the facility must include the written plan of veterinary care for the facility. This plan is
for guidance to the facility personal on agreed upon care for the animals at the facility. This plan should assure that
the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to
oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
