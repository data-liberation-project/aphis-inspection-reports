Care in transit.
Two animal holding areas currently in use, as well as an office sometimes used to hold animals, required cleaning and
sanitization. A layer of black grime and dirt, thick in many areas, was coating most of the floor of the animal holding rooms
and could be seen in the office along the room’s edges as well as below the desks. The surface of the cabinets sitting on
those floors, were also covered in a moderately thick layer of black grime and dirt. In the animal holding rooms and in the
small back section of the office, many areas of the walls were covered in black grime, dirt, and dust. There was a
significant accumulation of trash, such as empty plastic bottles and discarded paper, behind the desk in one of the animal
holding rooms. Lack of cleaning and sanitation may lead to the spread of disease and attract vermin which could lead to
an infestation. All animal holding areas must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation
of debris or excreta and to minimize vermin infestation and disease hazards.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
