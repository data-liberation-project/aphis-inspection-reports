2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Five guinea pigs had open wounds on their sides and/or backs. The owner reports these wounds are because
some males became aggressive towards each other. The owner had separated the males that fight, however had
not reported the bite wounds to the attending veterinarian. Open bite wounds can be painful or become infected
and cause the affected guinea pigs to get sick. To ensure that the guinea pigs with wounds receive appropriate
treatment, the attending veterinarian must be contacted to observe and make treatment recommendations for the
affected guinea pigs. Promptly report injured or sick animals to the attending veterinarian to obtain treatment
recommendations so that that possible pain or sickness can be prevented in affected guinea pigs.
