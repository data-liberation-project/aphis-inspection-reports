3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two primary enclosures housing five guinea pigs each are elevated approximately 3 feet off the ground. All four
sides of each enclosure are open and constructed of decorative railing with large spaces between each support.
During this inspection an adult guinea pig in one of the enclosures was seen repeatedly with its head, neck,
shoulders and front feet extended through the railing to the out side of the enclosure. Primary enclosures must
protect the animals from injury and be structurally sound enough to safely contain them. Should the guinea pigs
escape through the sides of the enclosure they are at risk of injury by falling to the ground. The guinea pig
enclosures should be replaced or modified to safely contain the animals.

3.28(c)(2)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Nineteen adult hamsters weighing between 2.8-3.5 ozs were housed in a primary enclosure providing 252 square
inches of floor space. The minimum amount of floor space required for these animals is 304 square inches. Each
hamster of this size needs 16 square inches of floor space to ensure sufficient space for each animal to make
normal postural adjustments, have freedom of movement and to prevent unnecessary social pressure. The
minimum space requirement shall be provided for each hamster.
Correct by: This non-compliance was corrected during the inspection by placing one half of these animals in a new
enclosure that provided adequate space.
