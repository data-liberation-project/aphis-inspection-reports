An old trailer was being used as the (cid:28)fence(cid:29) on one side of the yak enclosure. This trailer had old tin sheets running
along the bottom with sharp points exposed to the animals. An animal could be severely injured by the sharp tin.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was a large water puddle outside of the llama enclosure. This puddle appeared to be the result of a leaking
automatic water bowl inside the llama enclosure. Stagnant water puddles are breeding grounds for mosquitos and
other disease causing organisms. The automatic water bowl needs to be repaired and areas of large standing
water prevented in the future.
To be corrected immediately.
