3.127(d)(5) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
This facility has suffered four lamb losses due to predation (thought to be by coyote) since October 2018. The
facility has had a guard llama housed with the sheep. The fencing is mesh (field fence in some areas, chain link in
others) with electric wire or barbed wire on top.
The first loss was in the night of October 4-5, 2018. The second was sometime during the night of May 27-28, 2019.
For this one, it was discovered that nearby construction had caused damage to the fence, allowing entry of the
predator. The fence was quickly repaired. The third loss was overnight on June 18, 2019. The fourth was in daylight
on the morning of July 12, 2019, and occurred in the alleyway connecting the barn/barnyard area to the
farther-away pasture. Each of the lamb deaths of the 2019 crop was followed by the facility reviewing their program
according to a document "Wild Predator Loss Prevention Best Management Practices for Sheep," a document
produced with input from producer groups and government agencies. Prior to the fourth death, the sheep were
confined overnight to the small pasture where the barn is located. This area has a security light. The facility has
again reviewed its practices, and is consulting with USDA Wildlife Services for help in dealing with the predator(s).
Perimeter fences are not required for farm animals, such as sheep, as long as the facility has effective security
measures in place. The repeated predation incidents indicate that security measures are not effective to protect the
animals from harm..
Correction was in process at the time of inspection: the facility has been reviewing and revising their practices
according to the above-mentioned document with each lamb loss. They have outlined further tactics and resources
under consideration to be employed to increase their success in protection from predation.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
