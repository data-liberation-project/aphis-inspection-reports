2.8(h)
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
Upon arrival to the site 002 address the APHIS Official knocked on the door. A tenant answered the door and
indicated that there were no animals present and that she and her family have lived there for the last three months.
The owner has failed to inform the AC Regional Director about the change of address in a prompt manner.
Due to the length of time that the tenants have lived at the site 002 address, it is clear that the owner did not notify
the AC Regional Director about any changes within 10 days, as required.
The licensee shall promptly notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of ANY change in the name, address,
management or substantial control or ownership of his business or operation, or of any additional sites, within 10
days of any change.
