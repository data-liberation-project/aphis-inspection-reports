INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol for neuronal studies on guinea pigs does not have sufficient detail or an adequate
rationale for the numbers of animals requested in the protocol. This section of the protocol was incomplete and
difficult to follow.
The number of animals required should be clearly and scientifically justified to assure that no more animals are
used than are necessary for scientific validity. Even underestimating the number of animals or using inappropriate
species for a study may ultimately lead to excessive animal use. If an inadequate number of animals or an
inappropriate species were used initially, the activity may need to be duplicated with additional animals in order to
obtain the required information. An adequate rationale for the appropriateness of the number of animals and the
species being used must be included in each protocol in order that the IACUC may review and make decisions
regarding approval of the activity.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The floor of the guinea pig room has several small divots/damage to the epoxy floor. The small areas of damage
capture dust and debris. These areas of damage make it difficult to clean and sanitize the floor. The facility,
including the floor, must be maintained so that it is substantially impervious to moisture and can be readily sanitized
for the well-being of the animals.
