3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Multiple whelping boxes were empty but had not been cleaned since the dogs were removed. There was a very
strong ammonia odor in the whelping room and in the boxes due to this. These boxes need to be cleaned and
sanitized in a timely manner after the dogs are removed to facilitate cleaning of the area and to promote good
housekeeping practices. This needs to be addressed for the health of the remaining dogs in the whelping room.
