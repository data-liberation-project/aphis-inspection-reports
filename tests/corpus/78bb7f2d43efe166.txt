2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During inspection, two animals were identified as having a medical condition in need of veterinary evaluation:
• There was an approximately 1-inch-long hairless region around the base of the tail of the prairie dog. The licensee had
not identified this condition and therefore had not consulted the veterinarian for treatment.
• The left eye of a gray and brown rabbit was white and opaque. The top and bottom eyelids of the left eye were
moderately reddened. The rabbit maintained the left eye half-way closed. The licensee explained that the rabbit was
acquired with this eye condition, but the veterinarian had not been consulted.
Failure to promptly identify diseases/injuries as well as failure in seeking veterinary guidance for pre-exiting conditions
delays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress in animals with such conditions. The licensee must ensure
thorough daily observation of all animals as well as timely communication with the attending veterinarian in order to
provide proper diagnosis and medical attention. The currently affected animals need to be seen by a veterinarian for an
appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan.

2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.


The acquisition information for 5 rabbits and 2 Watusis were not documented. The facility does not maintain records
disclosing the disposition information of the released rabbits which has been his disposition method for the past couple of
years. Without records which fully disclose the animal’s acquisition/disposition information, legal and medical information
traceback is not possible. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose
the required information for acquisition and disposition of animals. The records shall include any offspring born of any
animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
During inspection, at different locations along the patron’s walkway, members of the public were seen interacting with and
feeding the bison, the cows, the zebras and the Watusis. A readily identifiable employee was not present during these
periods of public contact. Without an attendant present to monitor the interaction, the safety of the animals and the safety
of the public cannot be assured. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be
present at all times during periods of public contact.

3.50(a)

Facilities, general.
One rabbit was observed outside the rabbit enclosure roaming the property. The licensee stated he releases the rabbits
on the property after he keeps them in an enclosure for two weeks to acclimate them. The free roaming rabbits can be
exposed to many dangers such as predators, members of the public, golf carts (which are driven around the property), or
even escape. The current housing conditions is not providing a safe environment. Rabbits must have a housing facility


that protect them from injury, contain them, and restrict the entrance of other animals.

3.75(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
The metal frame of the indoor enclosure housing the singly housed Ringtail lemur had many areas that were significantly
rusted. The majority of the side bars on all four sides as well as most of the bottom section of the enclosure had areas
where the paint was worn off and coated in rust. The lemur was coming into contact with the rusted areas. Excessive rust
can affect the structural strength of surfaces and prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of enclosures. Correct by
ensuring that any significantly rusted surfaces that are in contact with the primates are repaired or replaced.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
Two areas of deficiency were identified with the non-human primate enrichment plan:
• The written plan did not describe the special attention provided to the young individually housed lemur who is being
hand-reared by the licensee, and unable to hear and see non-human primates of his own or compatible species. A
complete and well documented plan regarding the special attention provided to singly housed individuals is extremely
important to ensure the psychological well-being of the animals.
• The documented plan describes providing swinging and sitting devices as well as toys as part of the environmental
enrichment items. In general, the enclosures for all the non-human primates had very little in terms of perching and
swinging devices and many of the items provided were in need of repair. In fact, most of the primates were seen sitting on
the floor at the time of inspection. The enclosure for one of the singly housed rhesus macaque had approximately 4 thin
bamboo branches running the width of the enclosure at different areas but the branches were not fixed and did not appear


sturdy enough to safely support the primate. The only other swinging/sitting structure present in this particular enclosure
was a 3-step rope ladder hanging from the ceiling that was in need of repair. Two steps of the ladder were completely
coated in green material while the third one had a significant amount of thick white crusty growth covering it. Some of the
toys on the floor were broken children toys also in need of repair. The enrichment plan must be executed as written and
the enrichment items must be maintained in good repair in order to function adequately.
A well-documented and implemented enrichment plan is essential to prevent distress and maintain the psychological well-
being of the non-human primates. The enrichment plan must be developed in accordance with the currently accepted
professional standards and as directed by the attending veterinarian, including provisions for special considerations, and
must be adequately implemented with items maintained in good repair.

3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
Many areas within primary enclosures were found on inspection that do not protect the animals from injury:
• A portion of a fallen hay barn with a metal roof was approximately in the center of the outdoor enclosure of the zebras.
• A length of approximately 2 feet of unprotected electrical cord was located on the outside of a pump house and
accessible to the wolves within that enclosure.
• An unprotected electrical cord was plugged into a heater located on the wall within the sloth enclosure.
• There were two separate electrical plugs that were located on the wall in a room that both the enclosures of a juvenile
ring-tailed lemur and a prairie dog had access to. Both of their enclosures were pushed up against the wall where those
electrical plugs were located providing them access.
Animals can become injured by having access to fallen building materials or even electrocuted by having access to
electrical cords and/or electrical outlets. The housing facilities must protect the animals from injury and contain the


animals safely.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
Two enclosures, one housing two young bears and the other one housing two wolves, were not surrounded by a
continuous 8-foot perimeter fence. For both enclosures, the fencing is of sufficient height in some areas yet too short at
approximately 4 to 5 feet in height for some portions but, overall, there was not a continuous 8 foot fence on all four sides.
The lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within the facility in that there isn’t an
adequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient barrier
to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The facility must ensure that the above listed dangerous animals being
housed outdoors are enclosed by an 8-foot perimeter fence at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosures or shall
obtain a variance from the regional office.
