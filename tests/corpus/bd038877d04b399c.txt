FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor area of pig enclosure is in disrepair. The pigs walk through a doorway to gain access to the outdoor
portion of their enclosure. The sheet metal adjacent to the doorway is jagged and curling upward. Additionally, a
small section of jagged sheet metal is loose, movable, and hanging to the barn by a nail. Each of these areas are
accessible to the eleven pigs in the enclosure and could potentially injure them.
Repair or replace the broken and jagged sheet metal to prevent potential injury to the pigs.
