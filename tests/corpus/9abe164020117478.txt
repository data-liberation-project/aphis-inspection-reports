HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***The primary enclosure for the llama's, muntjac, pig's, goat and sheep doesn't have a barrier fence. These areas
have a floating attendant that monitors three pens at one time. The pen enclosing the pigs and llama that is
adjacent to the muntjac, sheep, goat and llama has a panel at the front gate to serve as a barrier but during the
inspection a pig was able to get in front of the paneling allowing the public direct contact with the animal. The
attendant can't be present at three petting sites at one time to monitor the publics interaction with the animals.
These areas should have constant monitoring by an attendant because the public can easily get to the enclosure
fence and put their hands or other objects through the enclosure.
All enclosures must have a barrier fence that is atleast 3 feet from the enclosure on all sides to protect the animals
and the public from injury.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The male patas monkeys night house has water damage to the ceiling with wood that is rotting and falling apart.
The water damage and rotting wood can affect the structural strength of the ceiling and the building is not being
maintained in good repair. The damaged ceiling maybe allowing rain water into the enclosures which may be
wetting the animals. The constant moist conditions can also potentially cause mildew and mold growth that can be
hazardous to the animals health andd well-being. The ceiling must be repaired and maintained to ensure that the
building is structurally sound and kept in good repair. Correct by May 17, 2015
***The fencing for the patas monkeys night house has an opening at the bottom of the fencing. The space at the
bottom of the fencing could allow predators or unwanted animals access to the animals enclosure. The fencing must
be repaired to protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.

3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. ***The patas monkey enclosure has a tree within the enclosure in which the lower one-third of the tree is covered in
green growth indicating that this surface is not readily sanitizable or can't be readily sanitized. Hard surfaces with
which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent disease hazards.
Corrected before the exit briefing.
The straw bedding in the mona monkeys den had insects and bugs crawling throughout it. Contaminated material
must be removed or replaced whenever raking or spot cleaning doesn't eliminate diseases, insects, pests or vermin
infestation. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy
generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
3.84(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***The mona monkeys den box had roaches and ants crawling throughout the bedding. Insects can be a disease
hazard and contaminate the bedding. The facility must establish an effective pest control program to control insects,
and mammals that are pest to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pest
in the animal areas.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The tigers night building has water damage to the ceiling with wood that is rotting and falling apart. The water
damage and rotting wood can affect the structural strength of the ceiling and the building isn't being kept in good
repair. The damaged ceiling maybe allowing rain water into the enclosures which may be wetting the bedding or the
animals. The ceiling must be repaired and maintained to ensure that the building is structurally sound and kept in
good repair.
*** The fencing for the pig and llama enclosure on the west side of the pen towards the front left corner needs
repair. The fencing is rolling up away from the ground potentially giving a small mammal access to the enclosure
and/or potentially allowing the escape of the contained animals within the pen. The enclosure should be structurally
sound and maintained to properly contain the animals and to protect them from injury.
***The wallaby shelter building has two exposed nails at ground level. The animal can come into contact with the
exposed nails which could injure the animal. The exposed nails must be removed to ensure that they don't injure the
animals housed in the enclosure. Corrected before the exit briefing.
3.125(c)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the diet facility there was a broken refrigerator containing produce that was wide open. The food within the
refrigerator wasn't properly being cooled and because the door was open the flies that were in the diet facility were
all over the produce in the refrigerator. The facility stated that they wash the produce outside and then later prepare
food in the facility. With the abundance of flies in the diet facility this method is not condusive to preparing food for
the animals without possible contamination. The perishable food should be stored and properly refrigerated in the
facilities to adequately protect it from deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. Corrected before exit
briefing.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Along the west side of the perimeter fencing adjacent to the diet facility there was a space approximately a foot
from the ground to the bottom of the fencing. There was an overgrowth of foliage and the fencing was rusted and
broken at the bottom of the fencing. These areas of deficiency are extensive and the entire perimeter fence should
be checked thoroughly. This space at the bottom of the fencing could allow predators or unwanted animals access
to the premises.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
***There is an abundance of flies at the facility. In the diet facility there needs to be a method in which to minimize
the flies in the area where the animals food is being prepared. Everytime the diet facility door opened more flies
would come in. During the inspection an employee was preparing food in which there were flies everywhere during
the process. It is virtually impossible to pepare food without the flies contaminating it. Also in the tigers pen there
was a tiger that had a swarm of flies on it. The facility stated that they spray the animals with fly repellent but it was
not sufficient enough to keep the flies off of the animals. The pest control program needs to be safe and effective to
control the pest. In the event a particular pest control program is not being effective then the facility should consider
revamping the program so it can adequately control the pest. Correct by May 19, 2015
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Executive Director.
