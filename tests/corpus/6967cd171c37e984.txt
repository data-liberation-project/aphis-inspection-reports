ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 145pm on
04/11/2016.
I knocked on the door and called and left a message that I was at the residence for an inspection and would be
there for the next 20 -30 minutes.
There was no return call and I left a message for them to call and advise me of any days or times that are better for
inspections in the future.
