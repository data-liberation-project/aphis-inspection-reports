ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male Burmese Mountain Dog "Spencer" that was squinting his right eye, had reddened tissue and clear
discharge. On closer observation, the lower eye lid was thickened and what appeared to be a 1/4 inch tear in the
lower eyelid. The surrounding tissues (conjunctiva) of the right eye also appeared reddened and inflamed. There
was also a abrasion under the right eye below the tear that was about 1 inch long. This dog was also observed
occasionally limping and favoring its right rear leg. Licensee stated this dog probably was injured by another male in
the enclosure. The lesions on this dogs eye and limping could indicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical
condition which may be painful. This dog had not been examined by a veterinarian for current conditions nor was
under any type of treatment at the time of inspection.
The licensee must have this dog seen by a licensed veterinarian no later than September 27, 2014 in
order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and that appropriate treatment plans are developed and
followed.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Record of Acquisition and Dogs on Hand (APHIS Form 7005).
*** The records that the licensee provided for inspection were incomplete and did not contain all the information as
required on the APHIS form 7005. The licensee only had 15 out of 24 dogs recorded on the dogs on hand form. Of
the fifteen dogs that were recorded, six did not have identification, acquired date, and acquisition information filled
out. Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with
certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. The licensee must use a USDA form 7005 (Dogs on Hand) and
make sure all information is filled out for each dog.
To be corrected by: October 15, 2014.
