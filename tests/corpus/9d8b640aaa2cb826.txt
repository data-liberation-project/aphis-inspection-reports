FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The fencing on side of the exhibit sheep and goats alongside the drive is loose. It needs to be tightened and
grounded to prevent the animals from injuring themselves.
*The young scimitar horned oryx was in the walkway of the barn attached with a rope and harness to the enclosure
fence of the alpaca enclosure. The oryx may injure itself or get tangled in the rope when left unattended. In addition,
if spooked he is strong enough to potentially pull down the alpaca enclosure fencing. The current panel fencing
enclosure used to house the oryx at night is no longer tall enough or strong enough to safely keep the maturing oryx
contained. The facility must construct a housing enclosure for the oryx that is structurally sound and will protect the
oryx from injury and contain him. Correct by 8/20/17.

WATERING.
The water receptacles for multiple species including the African Crested porcupine, sheep and goats are in need of
cleaning. There is green algae type growth on the sides of the receptacles and dirty, opaque water with vegetative
debris in the receptacles. Clean potable water needs to be provided for the animals to ensure their well-being. All
water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. Correct by 8/16/17.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The barn and the enclosures near the barn are in need of housekeeping.
*All accumulations of trash, old feed receptacles with food excreta/mold and stored non-husbandry related materials
shall be removed from the direct animal areas and cleared regularly to prevent odors and breeding places for
pests/vermin.
*Weeds (1.5 to 2.5 ft tall) in the goat/sheep enclosures and zebu/water buffalo/highlander enclosure need to be
trimmed/removed to allow the animals to enter their shelter structures, to be able to clean regularly and to prevent
areas where pests/parasites may live. Correct by 8/20/17.
