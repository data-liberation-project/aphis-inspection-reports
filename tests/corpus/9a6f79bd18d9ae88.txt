Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:17pm on 9/8/2021.
I arrived at the facility and called the licensee who said they were out of town for the day and another responsible adult
wasn't available. We discussed optimal hours of inspection.
