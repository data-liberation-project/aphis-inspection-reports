Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
At the time of inspection, there was no documented program of environmental enhancement for non-human primates to
review that addressed the needs of the ring-tailed lemurs, red-ruffed lemurs, and spider monkeys at the facility.
An adequate environmental enhancement program is essential in promoting the psychological well-being of non-human
primates. In accordance with professionally accepted standards and as directed by the Attending Veterinarian, the
licensee must develop and document an enrichment plan for the non-human primates.

Facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, three areas of food storage were not adequately protecting supplies and allowing food
contamination.
The back-left corner roof of the hay storage shed was missing and a portion of the round hay bale underneath was wet.
Upon further inspections, white strands of fungal-like growths were observed on the surface of the wet areas.
In the cooler, there was a box of zucchini which were dark, pitted and covered in white fuzzy growths. In the same cooler,
there was a box containing a squash, and a cantaloupe also shrunken, dark and covered with white fuzzy mold-like


growths, mixed among wholesome looking vegetables.
In one of the refrigerators there was a brown tacky substance spread around the bottom shelf with numerous small dead
flies. There were also two dead cockroaches on a shelf near food items.
Animals can become ill from consuming food that is spoiled or contaminated. All food must be stored properly to
adequately protect it from deterioration, molding or contamination.
