2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Inspectors reviewed records and discussed with the licensee details of an incident involving the death of a female
Grant(cid:25)s zebra ((cid:24)Dot(cid:25)). According to the licensee, employees reported that on 30 May 2014, a zebra escaped from
her enclosure when a tram entered the hoofstock exhibit. The licensee stated that facility protocol mandates that in
the case of an animal escape, that he is to be called immediately, and that he will coordinate the recapture effort.
However, he was not called at the time of this incident. The licensee reported that the employees broke protocol by
attempting to recapture the zebra using all-terrain vehicles, and that during the recapture attempt that the zebra ran
into the enclosure fence and subsequently expired. This animal was not handled in a manner which prevented
physical harm or unnecessary discomfort, which ultimately contributed to the animal(cid:25)s death. The licensee must
ensure that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible, and in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort at all times.

At the time of inspection, the licensee had taken action to address this incident.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Inspectors observed standing water and mud in the enclosure housing sheep, goats and an alpaca. Approximately
seventy percent of the enclosure was muddy and/or wet, including the shelter structure. The licensee reported that
straw was usually placed in the shelter, but none was observed on the day of the inspection. Suitable drainage must
be provided in order to ensure that the animals are comfortable, and have access to appropriate shelter. The
licensee must ensure that all animals have ready access to a dry shelter, and that excess water is rapidly eliminated
from the aforementioned, and all enclosures on the premises.
