ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1055 on
05-JUL-18.
I was able to make contact with the Licensee's husband at the door. He stated that the Licensee was not available
for inspection at that time.
