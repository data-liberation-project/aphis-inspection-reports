2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The APHIS form 7005 does not have the correct information listed. At least 16 dogs listed are no longer present at
this facility. Each animal must have adequate records maintained. These dogs that are no longer being cared for at
this facility need to be taken off of this 7005 form. This can help the breeder to adequately know that all does
present are being properly cared for. The breeder/manage must update this form 7005 and accurately maintain this
form when changes are made to the animal numbers. Correct by 02-20-2014.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility manager.
