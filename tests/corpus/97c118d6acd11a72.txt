3.6(a)(1)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* There are two heat lamps used as additional heat source for two adult dogs and 13 puppies. The heat lamps are
hung down into the enclosures at a level where the dogs can touch them. These heat lamps do not have the
attachable guards to prevent the dogs from touching the heat bulb. This can allow for potential injury from the dogs
being able to touch the heat bulb; in which, the heat bulb can break and cause a painful burn.
All facilities must be designed and kept in good repair or the heat lamps need protection guards,. This will prevent
injury to the animals.
To be corrected by, 26-December-2015.
