2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
Two incidents of non-reparable orthopedic injuries in non-human primates have been identified by the facility since
the previous inspection. Handling procedures are attributed to being a factor in causing the injuries. Orthopedic
injuries can be painful for animals and handling methods must not cause orthopedic injuries. Handling of animals
must be done as carefully as possible to avoid physical harm to the animals.
Note: Clinical veterinarians were promptly notified of these incidents and affected animals were humanely
euthanized. These incidents were reported to the attending veterinarian and the facility has taken corrective action
to prevent future occurrences.
Correction: Ensure corrective actions are followed.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
