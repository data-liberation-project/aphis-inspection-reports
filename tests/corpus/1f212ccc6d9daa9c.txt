2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Veterinarian last visited the facility 18 January 2016 at which time she went over the checklist included in the
license renewal packet and signed it. The Veterinarian also left instruction sheets for medications to be
administered routinely by the facility. The veterinarian did not leave a completed Program of Veterinary Care (PVC)
or indicate the frequency of visits to the facility. A formal PVC must be completed and maintained by the facility to
assure that the Veterinarian has provided guidance that is consistent with the best health and comfort of the
animals. Correct by contacting the Veterinarian and having them complete formal arrangements that include a
written program of veterinary care (PVC) and a plan for regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer. To
be corrected by: 7 March 2016.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility owner.
