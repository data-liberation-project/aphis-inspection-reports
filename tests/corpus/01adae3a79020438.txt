The grass and weeds throughout the lemur enclosure was high. High grass and weeds prevents the keepers from
conducting properly cleaning. The grass also promotes living areas for rodents, pests and vermin. Weeds and grass
must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The quarantine and animal holding areas humidity was noticeably high. This area currently houses several species
of reptiles, a Fennec fox and a Kinkajou. The humidity for the reptiles was adequate, however for the Fennec fox
which is a desert species, was too high. The high humidity could cause discomfort for species not normally
acclimated to those conditions. The high humidity conditions in an area used for quarantine also promotes the
propagation of pathogens including parasites. The housing facility shall be adequately ventilated to minimize
moisture as well as to provide for the health and to prevent discomfort of the animals at all times.
