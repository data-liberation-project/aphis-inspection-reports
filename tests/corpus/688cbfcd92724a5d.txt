3.81(e) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The majority of the nonhuman primates are singly housed. There are minimal records documenting attempts at pair
housing these animals or the additional enrichment being provided in lieu of social housing. There are six that are
paired permanently/or intermittently. It does not appear that there is a scheduled program for attempting to pair any
of the other NHP's which are described as geriatric. The individual animal records reviewed do not clearly indicate
why these animals remain singly housed. A structured program for the evaluation and re-evaluation of social
housing shall be developed. Any attempts at pairing, scientific justifications, veterinary exemptions, additional
enrichment provided, etc. shall be clearly documented. The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted
professional standards and must address the requirements as described in this Section of the Regulations.
