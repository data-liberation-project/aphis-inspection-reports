2.32(a) Critical

Personnel qualifications.
During an activity under an IACUC approved protocol conducted on 5 August 2021 involving paralytics in conjunction with
anesthesia for a procedure on one cat, the paralytic was incorrectly infused at 4.5 times the intended rate. The cat
developed an airway deficit fourteen minutes into infusion and, despite immediate intervention by veterinary personnel,
there was concern about hypovolemia and hypoxemia resulting in organ damage. Due to the poor prognosis the cat was
humanely euthanized. Lab members lacked the proficiency to administer paralytics correctly. The facility was unable to
ensure that all personnel involved with this activity were qualified to perform the procedures resulting in the death of one
cat. Develop a program of training and instruction to all personnel involved with research activities that ensures that all
personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are trained and qualified to perform their duties. Facility corrected
prior to inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Attending Veterinarian, Facility Veterinarians and IACUC staff.
