2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00pm on
03-May-17.
APHIS inspectors arrived at the facility at 1:00pm on May 3, 2017. Dr. Engel spoke with the licensee via telephone.
The licensee informed her that he was not at the facility and he was worried that his employee would not be able to
locate the any records required by the Animal Welfare Act. Dr. Engel asked the licensee if he would authorize his
employee to lead APHIS inspectors on the inspection or if this would be an attempted inspection, as the licensee
was not at the facility. The licensee said that this inspection would have to be considered an attempted as he was
not at the facility and unable to come back.
