3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are holes dug in the dirt in at least two enclosures on the ground. This has resulted in exposing the holes in
the buried panels, holes along the primary enclosure fence, and holes along the side of a dog shelter.
There is a hole along the opening of a shelter structure in an outdoor enclosure housing three Australian
Shepherds. This chewed hole appears to be jagged.
Holes dug in the dirt of the enclosures may cause injury to the dogs and may not securely contain the dogs.
Housing facilities that are not kept in good repair can cause injury to the animals. All housing facilities must be
constructed in a manner that securely contains the dogs and protects them from injury.

3.6(a)(2)(12)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are at least 4 elevated floors constructed with plastic-coated wire where the plastic coating has worn off of at
least 30% of the flooring. Bare wire flooring may be uncomfortable for the dogs and may cause foot problem . All
suspended flooring must be either greater than 1/8" in diameter or coated with plastic or fiberglass. Correct by 1
November 2015.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
There are at least 12 automatic food receptacles that have a build-up of food residue, dirt and oils in contact with
the food. An accumulation of this type of material can lead to a contamination of the food. The facility must keep all
food receptacles cleaned and sanitized at least every two weeks according to 3.11(b)(2).
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is one outdoor enclosure housing one shiba inu with feces trapped in the openings in the center of theenclosure floor. The feces trapped in the floor are dry and of sufficient volume to show that the enclosure has not
been spot cleaned daily. The build-up of feces in the enclosure can play a role in disease transmission, cause
odors, and attract pests. The licensee must remove excreta and food waste from primary enclosures daily. To be
corrected by 2 October 2015.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO and Kendall
