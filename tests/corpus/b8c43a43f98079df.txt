Facilities, general.
The four micro-pigs are currently housed indoors. The flooring in the enclosure is slippery inhibiting the pigs from getting
their footing when attempting to walk. There are blankets provided to cover some of the flooring but the pigs were
observed sliding on any exposed surface area. An appropriate surface shall be provided to protect the pigs from injury


when walking on the floor.
Indoor/outdoor type carpet mats were placed down immediately to allow the pigs to gain their footing. Corrected during
inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Manager.
