2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The method of cleaning and sanitizing rabbit cages was demonstrated to the inspector. Rabbits were removed from
the top two cages in a stack of four. The power washer was then started and the top two cages in the tier were
cleaned. The rabbits in the cages directly to the right of the cages being cleaned became extremely agitated. They
jumped wildly around the cage. One of the rabbits fell over on its side and began thrashing as if having a seizure.
These rabbits were in extreme distress. This method of cage cleaning and sanitizing rabbit cages is not acceptable
and must be stopped immediately. Another means must be found to clean and sanitize rabbit cages. The facility
altered their procedure proposing to remove the cage from the rabbit area for cleaning and sanitizing.
Correct by: Correct immediately
3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Although many of the primary enclosures cited on the inspection of 4-13-15 have received needed repairs, about
10% of the cages in the lower section still need wire replacement. The structural integrity of the wire has been
compromised by years of use. This wire forms the back walls of many of the cages and the bottom corners of
several. This wire needs to be replaced in order to prevent animal injury leading to unnecessary animal suffering.
3.54(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The upper level had about 50% of the feeders rusted on the inside lip of the feeder to a point that they can no
longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. These feeders must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. It is
essential that these feeders be effectively cleaned and sanitized in order to prevent the spread of disease and
control odors which become a problem when items cannot be cleaned and sanitized thoroughly.
Inspection conducted at the Oakwood facility.
Exit interview conducted with the site manager.
