HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
A member of the public was bitten by the male marmoset. The animal keeper allowed the person to enter the
marmoset enclosure with him to take photographs. Proper distance or barriers must be in place or the animal kept
under the control of an experienced handler.
