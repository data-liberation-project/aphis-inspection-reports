ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male Yorkshire Terrier (#048127007) was observed with matted fur and a dental condition. Several various
sized mats were present over most of the dog's body. Mats, containing very hard fecal-like material, were present
on the dog's rear feet and appeared to completely encompass the two middle toenails on each rear foot. Matting
was also present along the dog's abdomen, legs and face. Also, there was a heavy build-up of yellowish brown to
dark brown to grey material on the teeth. This abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the teeth and
extended into the gumline. The gums were reddened along some of these teeth. The dog flinched while looking in
the mouth so repeated attempts were not made. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage
to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This can be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and
negatively impact the overall health of the animal. Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of skin
sores. The licensee must have this animal's mouth and teeth examined in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is made and an appropriate dental treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must develop
and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in
the facility. The licensee must ensure this dog is groomed and establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all
dogs. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. TO BE

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***There were 4 Yorkshire Terrier puppies that were less than 16 weeks of age and had no cage card or other form
of identification. Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty
and to facilitate record keeping requirements. The licensee must ensure that all dogs less than 16 weeks of age are
identified by an official tag as described in Sec. 2.51, a legible tattoo approved by the Administrator, a microchip, or
a cage card (if maintained as a litter with their dam and housed within the same primary enclosure). TO BE
CORRECTED BY: January 27, 2015.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.***The APHIS Form 7005 was missing some of the required information. There were 33 adult dogs counted during
the facility inspection and only 19 dogs were listed on the form. Also, it did not contain disposition information for
two Boston Terriers. Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can
be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals.The licensee must maintain records which fully
and correctly disclose all of the information required on an APHIS Form 7005. TO BE CORRECTED BY: January

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(c) Additional requirements for dogs--(1) Space. (i)
***In one enclosure, housing two adult Yorkshire Terriers, there was not sufficient floor space provided for the
animals. The enclosure was measured at 2 feet by 4 feet providing a total floor space of 8 sq. ft some of which was
taken up by a water receptacle on the floor. The measurement of one of the dogs in the enclosure was 19 inches.
The licensee agreed that the other Yorkshire Terrier in the enclosure was at least 19 inches. Therefore, the required
floor space for each of the dogs was (19 in. + 6 in.)(19 in. + 6 in.)/144 = 4.34 sq. ft. for a total combined required
floor space of 8.68 sq. ft. This enclosure was not large enough for both of the dogs. Adequate floor space is
required in order to ensure that the animals can make normal postural adjustments and for their health and
well-being. The licensee must provide all animals with adequate floor space at all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY:
January 22, 2015.
The inspection was conducted with an MDA inspector and the licensee. An exit interview was conducted on
January 21, 2015 with the licensee.
