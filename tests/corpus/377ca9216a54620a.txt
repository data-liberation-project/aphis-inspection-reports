ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 pm on
04-Oct-17.
I arrived at the facility at 2:00 pm and the wife met me in the driveway. She stated that the owner was unavailable to
conduct an inspection. I left the facility at 2:30 pm.
