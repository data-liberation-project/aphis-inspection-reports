2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Each breeder/owner of dogs shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the
purchase or removal of such animals in the kennel facility. Each breeder/owner shall use Record of Acquisition
and Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) and Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006)
to make, keep, and maintain the information required. The current adult dog list (form 7005) does not match the
total number counted during today's inspection. The owner must update this form to correctly match the number of
animals on hand. Also, adult dogs have left this facility without a record of disposition (form 7006). The owner must
insure that every dog that leaves this facility, from a sale, exchange, transfer, or by donation, a 7006 form has been
correctly filled out. Correct by 07-13-2017.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Housing enclosures where dogs reside must have adequate drainage of water. Whether it be water from cleaning
or water from the weather. Drainage must be constructed so that run off water can be rapidly eliminated and
animals can stay dry. The runs of the outdoor and sheltered facilities have areas of water that is standing and
ground is muddy. Standing water can lead to insect problems. Muddy/dirty runs can lead to poor health issues.
The owner must put into place a good drainage program to remove rain water in a more timely fashion. This will
help ensure that dogs can stay clean, dry and healthy. Correct by 07-16-20173.3(e)(1)(ii)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Outdoor runs of sheltered facilities that are not exposed to direct sunlight must be impervious to moisture. The
sheltered facility has covered runs that are made up of dirt/gravel and cannot be adequately cleaned. Also, covered
runs that are not impervious to moisture cannot be sanitized properly. The owner must make this area of the
covered runs impervious. This will help in the proper cleaning, sanitizing, and give the dogs a healthier place to live.

3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Surfaces of primary enclosures must be cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks (and more often
if needed). The doggy doors of the sheltered facility are covered with an excessive amount of grease, grim, and
dirt. The owner must clean and sanitize these doors more often to help maintain a clean and healthy environment
for dogs. Good cleaning practiced can help in the control of diseases, too.
