2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the "southeast" building there was a female white Maltese (AVID 026280633) that had heavy tartar with gum
recession over the upper premolar teeth on both sides. She, also, had a swelling between her toes and an area
with moist skin, but no discharge. The licensee made an appointment for the dog, while we were there, for the
same day.
Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue, and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the
ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The licensee must provide adequate
veterinary care to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The information including diagnosis,
treatment, and resolution of the conditions must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative, ACI Bartels, and VMO Shaver.
