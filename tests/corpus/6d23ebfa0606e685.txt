3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
There are excessive amounts of brown matter (dirt, excreta, debris, etc) adhered to whelping boxes where chew damage
is present. In addition there is green organic material build up on exterior platforms with multiple areas of chew damage.
The areas with chew damage are no longer able to be properly cleaned and sanitized. Insufficient cleaning is directly
contributing to the disease hazards and odor within the facility. The applicant must ensure all surfaces of housing
facilities to include, housing structures, dens, other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility, that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized are replaced, resurfaced or repaired when they become worn or soiled.
3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Inspectors observed excreta and hair buildup in the corners and underneath all primary enclosures on the whelping side
of the kennel. The external platforms used by the dogs to enter the indoor portion of the kennel have a moderate to
excessive green organic buildup present. The improper cleaning of the facility is directly contributing to the strong odor
within the facility. Insufficient cleaning of surfaces in contact with the dogs or throughout the facility can contribute to
increased disease hazards and attract insects and/or pests. The applicant must spot clean daily and ensure all surfaces
in contact with the dogs are cleaned and sanitized at least every two weeks or as often as necessary to satisfy all
cleaning requirements set forth in the AWA.
