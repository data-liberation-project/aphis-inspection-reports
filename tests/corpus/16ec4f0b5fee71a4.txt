ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The animal was treated by the veterinarian on February 12, 2016 for an ear infection. Treatment included the use
of an ear spray for 7-10 days. The bobcat was observed scratching its right ear. There was blood on its face and
around the ear from the scratching. The continued scratching indicates the infection has not cleared. The bobcat
should be re-evaluated by the veterinarian to provide appropriate care for the animal. Contact the veterinarian by
close of business March 31, 2016 and schedule an appointment to evaluate the injury and provide adequate care of
the ear condition.
