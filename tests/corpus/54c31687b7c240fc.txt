3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
- Four enclosures housing rabbits had an excessive accumulation of hair, cobwebs, and waste adhered to the floors
and walls. Accumulation of waste and debris poses an increased risk of contamination to the enclosed animals.
Primary enclosures must be kept clean of debris, hair, and other waste. The licensee must clean these enclosures,
and must maintain them as needed to help protect the health and welfare of the animals. This affects four rabbits.
