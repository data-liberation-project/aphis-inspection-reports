FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the back area of the kangaroo exhibit, there is wooden siding covering 2 beams where the edges around the
bottom are in dis-repair and splintering ends remain. Animals coming in contact with these areas may become
injured.
A system should be in place to ensure animal enclosures are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury.

FEEDING.
The refrigerator in the back of the Australia house is being used to store both human and animal food. There is no
clear signage/ indication which items are for animal use only. In addition, at least two food items were improperly
stored, i.e. without a label and/or stored directly on the refrigerator shelf unprotected. Intermingling of human and
animal food and Improper storage can lead to food contamination. A system should be in place to ensure the
animal food is wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of nutritive value to maintain all animals in
good health.
