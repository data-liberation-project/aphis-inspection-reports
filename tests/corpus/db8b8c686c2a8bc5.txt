3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The majority of door inserts in the sheltered portion of the facility have a buildup of brown dirt and grime along the
sides and bottom of the doorway, including multiple door flaps on the inside. The buildup is quite thick in some
enclosures and greasy in consistency. There are five whelping boxes that have a moderate amount of brown grime
buildup along the walls and runners of the boxes that do contain puppies. There is an indoor pen that contains
three Chihuahuas' where the wire flooring has a buildup of hair and dirt and grime. While the enclosures are being
spot cleaned, they are not being cleaned thoroughly enough to prevent an accumulation of dirt and grime on the
walls, runners and doorway inserts. The outdoor run areas have a buildup of old feces and hair that has
accumulated around and in the holes of the cement bricks used as a step for the dogs to enter the indoor area.
A buildup of dirt, grime, hair and old feces in the primary enclosures can be a source of disease or other health
issues if left in contact with the regulated animals and around their food sources.
The licensee must thoroughly clean all hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact and they must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta
and grime buildup in order to reduce disease hazards and contamination.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are multiple water receptacles' (approx. 10) in the facility that have a large amount of lime buildup around the
water nipples that do not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization.
The buildup of lime on water receptacles' can hold bacteria and possible disease hazards that are assessable to the
regulated animals that will have contact with the dirty surface every time they take a drink of water. Lime buildup is
not able to be sanitized.The licensee must properly clean all water receptacles' or replace them where there is a buildup of lime or other
grime/debris in order to be able to properly sanitize at least once every 2 weeks according to 3.11(b)(3) in order to
prevent possible disease hazards or contamination.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is evidence of mouse activity in the facility due to a moderate amount of mouse feces along the runners and
by the food containers in two of the whelping enclosures that contain regulated animals. There is evidence of mouse
feces along the top of the covered whelping boxes and a large amount of dirt/grime and mouse feces on the work
counter in the facility where the trimmers and paperwork are located and next to the covered feed bin. There is a
mouse bait station in the facility, however it has not been baited for a long time.
The presence of mice and their feces can cause a potential health risk to the regulated animals, and it is important
that pest control methods are initiated at the first sign of mice or other vermin that have contact with the regulated
animals and/or their living environment.
An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs must be established and
maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal
areas.
