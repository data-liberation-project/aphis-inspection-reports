WATERING.
At the time of inspection, the smaller water receptacle for the 2 baby goats was empty and dry. These 2 baby goats
are in an enclosure with 5 adult goats and 3 adult sheep, where a larger and taller water receptacle is present,
however the water in this receptacle is not accessible to the baby goats. If potable water is not accessible to the
animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal. Frequency
of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.
