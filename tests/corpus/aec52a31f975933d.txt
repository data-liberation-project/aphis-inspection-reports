ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A review of post operative and daily treatment records for a rabbit (ID #7) under IACUC approved protocol
#88-04-17D, showed that the rabbit was given enrofloxacin at a dosage of 5 mg subcutaneously every 6 hours
beginning on 03-04-2016. The rabbit received 4 injections over the course of 24 hours. There is no provision for
the use of enrofloxacin in the protocol. There was also no documentation in the records which indicated the need
for a therapeutic antibiotic and no documentation that the attending nor clinical veterinarian had been contacted
regarding its use.
Post operative treatment or usage of therapeutic agents without attending veterinarian approval may lead to
adverse health effects in research animals. Animals must be observed daily and any veterinary care issues timely
and accurately relayed to the attending veterinarian. The facility must insure that a program is place to insure that
all animals receive prompt and adequate veterinary care.
To be corrected immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
