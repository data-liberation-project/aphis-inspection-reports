Housing facilities, general.
Wire mesh fencing on the door frame and entry door to the enclosure housing 4 ring-tailed lemurs was observed to have
sharp points. The sharp points extend the entire length of the door and framing and are accessible to the lemurs.
Enclosures that are not properly maintained can cause injury to the animals. Enclosures must be kept in good repair so
that they are structurally sound and free from sharp points and loose wires.

Facilities, outdoor.
There is no perimeter fence around the enclosure housing 3 Patagonian cavies. The facility had a perimeter fence
variance for the cavies. However, the enclosure was relocated, and the perimeter fence variance no longer applies. Lack
of a perimeter fence does not protect the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from having
contact with the animals. Also, without a perimeter fence there is no secondary containment system. A perimeter fence
must be provided for this enclosure to keep unauthorized people and unwanted animals from coming in contact with the
cavies and provide a secondary containment system in the event of an escape.
