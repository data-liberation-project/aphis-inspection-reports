2.1
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This former licensee is still conducting regulated activity. When asked about his business, he replied that he has
40-45 dogs on the premises, and that all of the puppies are sold wholesale. He declined to name the brokers or
stores that buy the puppies. The requirements for licensing under USDA were discussed, namely that a dealer who
maintains more than four breeding females and who sells puppies wholesale or sight unseen is required to have a
USDA license. The former licensee refused to acknowledge that he is not in compliance with the Animal Welfare
Act. Failure to maintain a USDA license while continuing to conduct regulated activity knowingly evades the
regulatory process and prevents federal inspectors from ensuring the health and well-being of the animals
maintained by the facility. Correct by obtaining a USDA license prior to conducting any further regulated sales of
puppies (i.e., to a broker or pet store), or by discontinuing the regulated activity.
Correct from this time forward.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A USDA LICENSE.
This was a search inspection conducted with the former licensee.
