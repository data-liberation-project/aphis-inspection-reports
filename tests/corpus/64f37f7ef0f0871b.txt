ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee has been doing his own descenting surgery on baby skunks. However, the surgical procedure had not
been described and approved by the Attending Veterinarian in the Program of Veterinary Care. This has been
corrected at the time of the inspection, in that the Attending Veterinarian has described an approved procedure that
can be performed by the licensee. The licensee must follow the protocol when each skunk is descented. Failure to
follow a procedure approved by the attending veterinarian would risk harm or distress to the animal.

Inspection conducted with the licensee and Joe Kovach, ACI
