2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Forty nine animal records reviewed under protocols 1507043 and 1507044 in November and December 2015 did
not document an increase in observations at the onset of clinical signs as indicated in the approved protocols.
Additionally, the scoring sheet used when animal observations were recorded did not correlate with the project
specific scoring sheet approved for use in these protocols.
Significant changes to approved protocols must be reviewed and approved prior to implementation. The IACUC had
identified and addressed these protocol deviations at the time of this inspection.
2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Nine of twenty five guinea pigs used under protocol 1507043 were found dead in cage during the study. Ten of
twenty four guinea pigs under protocol 1507044 were also found dead in cage during the study. Death was not the
endpoint on either protocol.
These deaths were not reported or communicated to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. A mechanism of
direct and frequent communication must be in place to ensure timely and accurate information is conveyed to the
attending veterinarian on problems of animal health and well-being. This information is critical for the maintenance
and refinement of an appropriate and adequate program of veterinary care.
Correct by: Immediately.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On January 16, 2016 a sheep was moved from a transport cage to the primary enclosure after weighing. The sheep
sustained a front leg fracture that required euthanasia when it jumped over the temporary ramp used to facilitate
movement between the uneven surfaces of the transport cage and primary enclosure. Standard operating procedures should be reviewed and modified as needed to prevent further injury during
transport and handling of animals. Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that
does not cause physical harm or trauma.
Correct by: April 1, 2016.
3.81(a)(3)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The twelve cynomologus macaques in room 1506 were individually housed in enclosures without visual contact.
Individually housed nonhuman primates must be able to see and hear nonhuman primates of their own or
compatible species unless the attending veterinarian determines that it would endanger their health, safety and
well-being.
No exception was provided for these animals and the restricted visual contact is also contrary to the intent of the
facility primate enrichment program. Research facilities must follow an appropriate plan for environmental
enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates.
Correct by: This non-compliant item was corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection was conducted from February 16-18, 2016 with Drs. Moore, Pannill, Maginnis-USDA, the attending
veterinarian, clinical veterinarians and senior IACUC manager.
The exit interview was conducted on February 18, 2016 with Drs. Moore, Pannill, Maginnis-USDA the IACUC chair,
vice chair, IO, attending veterinarian, chief research officer, senior IACUC manager and other facility
representatives.
