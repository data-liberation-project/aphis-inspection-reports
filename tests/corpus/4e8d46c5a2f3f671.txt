2.50(a)(2) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***The licensee is not properly identifying puppies that are less than 16 weeks old. Ten puppies from three
separate litters did not have any form of identification. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet
recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must
properly identify puppies with an acceptable form of identification, which include a cage card (if litters are not
comingled), a microchip, a collar and tag, or a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
