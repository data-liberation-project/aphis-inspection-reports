Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. An adult brown and black guinea pig in Pen 23 was noted to have a
firm movable mass under its chin approximately 1 inch in diameter. The facility had not observed the condition and was
not administering any treatments. The condition was addressed in the Program of Veterinary Care with treatment options
listed.
Swellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of the
animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment
for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional animals if the
condition is contagious.
The facility must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending veterinarian to
determine a diagnostic and treatment plan.

Facilities, general.


The facility was undergoing renovation and there were areas of the room still in need of repair. There was an
approximately 6 x 2 inch area of missing floor board with exposed insulation visible. There was an approximately 3 x 3
inch area of missing floor board with that communicated with an opening below the building.
Gaps in the floor with openings to the outside can lead to escaped animals if animals escape their enclosures. Insulation
exposed by gaps in the floor cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized and can harbor bacteria that can lead to disease
spread.
Housing facilities for guinea pigs must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.

Primary enclosures.
The facility had a set of stacked pens and 5 of these contained juvenile guinea pigs (approximately 59 guinea pigs).
These pens had a gap in the wire on one side approximately 4 x 5 inches in size. There were sharp wire points for every
1 inch square surrounding this gap. The size of the gap was large enough for a juvenile guinea pig to escape and the
upper pen was approximately 6 feet high.
Sharp wire tips and gaps that allow animals to escape can result in injury.
Primary enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.
Correct by ensuring there are no gaps or sharp points in the enclosures.
