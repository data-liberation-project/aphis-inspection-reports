HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.1(f) - Drainage for dogs and cats. Housing facilities must be equipped with drainage systems that are
constructed and operated so that animal waste and water are rapidly eliminated and animals stay dry.
At time of inspection the plastic drain underneath the outside elevated enclosures on the west side had cracked. It
was broken apart in places allowing the feces and urine to drain on the ground. The drain needs to be replaced to
be able to rapidly eliminate the waste. To be corrected by 07-31-17.
At time of inspection the outside drain on the south end of the kennel was not working properly allowing waste to
come out the top of the drain and then down to the ground and standing with no where to rapidly eliminate. The
drain needs to be fixed so it works properly to keep diseases to a minimum from the standing urine and fecal matter.
