2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:42 PM on
14-MAY-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I called the home phone number listed for the licensee. Mrs. Wilbur answered and
advised me to call Mr. Wilbur's mobile number. I called and left a message, and then called the mobile phone again,
after waiting for 35 minutes at the facility. After leaving the second message, I left the facility.
