FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Zoo section of the facility, where water buffalo, llamas, and calves were housed, there was metal-wired
fencing
making up the south wall of the primary enclosure. It had several broken wires leaving sharp, pointy edges that
were
in direct contact with the animals. These sharp points were within eye level of many of the animals. Sharp points
could injury these animals housed there. The licensee must ensure that enclosures and their contents are
maintained
in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the Hot Tub section of the facility, there were areas, closest to the camels, where the perimeter fencing was
heavily tilted outwards thus affecting the overall integrity of the fencing and possibly its ability to contain the animals.
A durable and intact perimeter fence is an important in secondary containment to keep the camels within their
enclosure as well as prevent unauthorized people or animals from entering. The licensee must have a system in
place to ensure the perimeter fence is maintained in an effective manner.
