INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In review of protocols 14-18, 14-41, and 14-26 which contain different procedures which may cause pain and / or
distress that is more than momentary, the USDA inspector noted there was not a search for alternatives. The
procedures are pyrogen test, administration of FCA and/or DNCB, and positive results from the test article. The
IACUC must ensure that the Principal Investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more
than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals, and has provided a written description of the methods and
sources used to determine that alternatives were not available to attempt to reduce and refine animal use.
Correct for all potentially painful and or distressful procedures that are more than momentary by Dec 31, 2014.

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Rabbit #41049 had been observed and recorded as normal by a research associate in the morning. Later in the
morning USDA observed the animal to be rigid and inactive in its enclosure with no fresh fecal production. During
USDA presence, Veterinary Services assessed the animal and found it to have lost approx. 14% body weight in two
days and they initiated supportive treatment. Later in the day, the rabbit produced a small amount of diarrhea. The
next day the animal appeared to be significantly improved and was still under veterinary treatment. The research
associate had performed the required observation on the animal but failed to recognize illness in this rabbit. The
facility must ensure that all personnel involved in animal care are qualified to perform their duties.
Correct by November 14, 2014.
This inspection was conducted on Oct 28-29, 2014 with an exit briefing on Oct. 29th with the Director of Preclinical
