Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:35 pm on
02/19/2016.
In addition to waiting 30 minutes, I knocked on the door of the home on premises, called the phone number
provided and honked my vehicle horn.
This attempted inspection will be sent by regular mail.
