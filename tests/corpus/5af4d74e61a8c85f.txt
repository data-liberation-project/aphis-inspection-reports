Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
There are no swings or perches present for the spider monkey in the indoor enclosure. This enclosure is used during cold
and winter months. The environmental enhancement plan for non-human primates on file states that the spider monkey
will be provided with swings or perches to allow the animal to brachiate. Housing facilities need to provide opportunities
for animals to express species typical locomotion to promote their heath and psychological well-being. Licensee must
ensure that the spider monkey is provided with the ability to brachiate with such items as swings or perches. Correct by
