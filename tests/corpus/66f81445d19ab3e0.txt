ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care still does not include bobcats. Bobcats are now present at the facility. It is
essential that these animals be included in the program of veterinary care. Veterinary recommendations for care of
these animals should be included in the program. APHIS inspectors then use this information while inspecting the
animals in order to determine if veterinary recommendations are being followed by the facility. This program is a
valuable tool in order to ensure the continuing health and comfort of these animals. Bobcats need to be included on
the program of veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The brown goat noted on the inspection of 8-13-14 still has a long toe on the outside of its right rear foot. The white
goat noted on the inspection of 9-9-14 still had long toes on both of its rear feet. These goats need to have these
toes trimmed. Long overgrown hoofs can cause conformation issues and joint problems. Trim these goats' hoofs.
A small white fox was noted by the inspectors to have a red tinged drainage from its right ear. This drainage
covered the ear pinnae and extended onto the shoulder of the fox. Ear infections can be quite painful and this fox
needs to receive veterinary treatment. This fox needs to be treated by the attending veterinarian by close of
business on 10-3-14. Veterinary instructions for care need to be written and available for APHIS inspector review.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A small white fox was noted by the inspectors to have a red tinged drainage from its right ear. This drainage
covered the ear pinnae and extended onto the shoulder of the fox. Ear infections can be quite painful and this fox
needs to receive veterinary treatment. No one at the facility had noticed the condition of this foxes' ear. Failure to
observe health issues and promptly report them to the attending veterinarian will lead to unnecessary suffering and
even possible animal death. The fox is suffering due to his current condition. Thorough daily observations of all
animals should be made. Animals with known problems should receive extra scrutiny. Report all health issues
promptly to the veterinarian.3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Two domestic cats are housed in an enclosure that contains one litter box. Three domestic cats are housed in an
enclosure also with one litter box. These litter boxes had excessive feces in them. Primary enclosures are to be
cleaned of fecal material daily. Excessive feces in litter boxes can lead to odor problems. It can also be a potential
source of disease and pest control issues. Excessively dirty litter boxes can be a source of discomfort to the cats as
they will hesitate to use the boxes when they are overly soiled. The cats in the enclosure housing three cats were
defecating in the bedding contained in their shelter. This could result in soiling of the cats and ingestion of feces as
they groom themselves. This can lead to parasite and other potential infections. Clean litter boxes daily.
3.84(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The enclosure housing two lemurs contained an excessive amount of fecal material. The baboon enclosure
housing the larger baboon contained excessive feces next to the water receptacle. Excessive fecal material can
lead to disease, pest and odor control issues. The lemurs can become contaminated by lying in the fecal material
and subsequently ingesting it while grooming. The baboon's water could easily become contaminated with fecal
material. This could lead to potential bacterial or parasitic infections for these animals. Clean these enclosures on
a more frequent basis. These enclosures need to be cleaned.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The primary enclosure housing three foxes has multiple areas of the wire lining the enclosure exposed by the
digging of the foxes. Some of this wire has broken and is an injury as well as an escape hazard. A section of
exposed wire along the front of the enclosure has a gap that could allow a fox to escape. It is possible that a fox
could escape or become trapped or injured by the broken wire while attempting to escape. This enclosure needs
immediate repair to contain and protect the foxes housed in it.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Deteriorating apples, peaches oranges and nectarines were
discolored and soft. Black rotting lettuce was also in the produce cooler. The refrigerator in the warm room
contained rotting apples, spoiled tomatoes, cauliflower and green peppers. Liquid drained from the package of
green peppers when they were moved for closer inspection. A soft cantaloupe was also in the cooler. Spoiled
produce must be removed promptly to prevent contamination of food intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and
remove spoiled produce promptly. This cooler and the refrigerator need to be cleaned and have spoiled anddeteriorating items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will be fed to the animals.
The meat cooler had a horrible ammonia like odor mixed with the odor of rotten and decaying meat. This odor
makes it very hard to determine if the meat items stored in this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the
cooler, identify the source of the odor and eliminate it.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle boxes for the enclosure housing two American black bears and the enclosure housing two
Asian black bears contained a large amount of rotting food debris. The grizzly bear feed area contained
unidentifiable rotting food debris. Any food fed in these areas is going to be contaminated by the rotting material
present. These feeders need to be cleaned and made sanitary to ensure that the food fed to the bears is
wholesome and free from bacterial or pest infestation which could result in health issues for the bears.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the tigers known as Lenny and Squiggy had a large amount of
green algae floating in it. This receptacle is not being kept clean and sanitary. Dirty water receptacles can affect
water palatability. It can also lead to contamination of the water by pathogenic organisms. Water palatability is
very important as poor water palatability can lead to decreased consumption. Decreased water consumption can
lead to renal function problems. The majority of the large cats at this facility are advanced in age, making them
especially susceptible to kidney problems. Clean this water receptacle. Clean all water receptacles as often as
need to keep the water clean.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive feces in the enclosures housing the tigers, Xena, Sher Kahn and Kahn. The shelter boxes for
the tigers known as Lenny and Squiggy and the tiger Pandora contained excessive bones and rotting food waste.
The enclosure for the tiger known as JJ contained excessive fecal material. JJ's shelter box contained excessive
bones and rotting food waste. The American black bear den box contained rotting food waste. The Asian black
bear den box contained excessive food waste. The Asian black bear enclosure contained excessive fecal material.
The enclosure housing the white tiger contained excessive fecal material. The cougar enclosure contained
excessive feces. The enclosure housing three alpacas contained excessive fecal material. These enclosures needto be cleaned on a more frequent basis. The rotting material present in these animals'(cid:25) enclosures and shelter
boxes can contaminate these animals as they lay in their enclosures. The animals can ingest this material when
they groom themselves. Not removing old food waste promptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting
this rotten material can lead to potential health problems. Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a
buildup of food and fecal waste to minimize odors and prevent potential health problems.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The alleyway leading to the butcher area as well as the area directly outside the building housing the butcher area
and the alleyway and building next to the butcher area are filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash,
buckets, tires and fencing. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and numerous
rodent holes were located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located going under the shelter box for the cougar enclosure. Rodent holes were
located inside the cougar enclosure. Multiple rodent holes were noted in the service alleyway for the tiger
enclosures located on leopard row as well as in the tiger enclosures. Rodent feces was also noted in this alleyway.
A rodent hole was seen in the service area for the tiger Pandora's enclosure and the tigers Lenny and Squiggy's
enclosure. A rodent hole was noted going under the den area for the tiger JJ's enclosure. Rodent holes were
noted in the service area for the lion and the tiger JJ. A rodent hole was noted going under the shelter box of the
Asian black bear enclosure. Several other rodent holes were located near the enclosure and a live rat was seen
entering a hole. Rodent holes and a live rat were seen near the white tiger enclosure. Rodents can be carriers of
disease which may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of pest control must
be established for the facility.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. The president of the facility stated to
APHIS inspectors that there was no formalized scheduling of workers at the facility. A lack of properly trained
employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers
must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be added. Workers need to be trained in the basic
needs of the animals at the facility. Topics should include at a minimum: the importance of adequate water, the
need for adequate bedding during times of extreme weather, the importance of cleaning and good housekeeping
procedures, proper diet for different species of animals and observation of animals for abnormal conditions and
behaviors. This training should be done in conjunction with the attending veterinarian or his designee. A list oftopics covered and attendees must be documented for review by APHIS. A facility schedule needs to be developed
that allows for adequate employee coverage in order to address all animal husbandry needs. Also the facility
president is the only one authorized to work with the dangerous animals at the facility. All animal work must be
done with the dangerous animals under his direct supervision. This limits the amount of time that is available to
service the dangerous animal enclosures as the facility president is often offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the
dangerous animal enclosures. The facility president needs to find a way to be onsite more or hire trained staff to
help run the facility.
The inspection was conducted with the facility president on 10-2-14. An exit interview was conducted at that time
and all non-compliant items were explained to the facility president and vice president. The need for veterinary care
for the fox and APHIS expectations for veterinary documentation were explained at this time. A formal exit interview
was conducted with the facility vice president on 10-6-14.
