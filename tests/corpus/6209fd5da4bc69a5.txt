ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The singly housed black bear has severe facial lesions which started on March 8, 2015. The end of the bear's nose
has erosions and is red raw. The corneas of both eyes are red and clouded over affecting vision. There are crusty
plaques from the nose to the eyes along the top of the muzzle. The attending veterinarian was out the next day and
started the bear on injectable and oral antibiotics. He rechecked the bear once while it was on antibiotics for two
weeks. The licensee called the veterinarian to come back out last week and the bear was observed 3 days ago.
The veterinarian did not offer any diagnostic or treatment options, but stated as long as the bear was not suffering
and was eating - indicating nothing further.
This bear is suffering in that it is losing its vision and has facial lesions which may be irritating. A full diagnostic
workup is needed to determine the cause of the lesions so that adequate treatment can be initiated. If the
attending veterinarian will do the diagnostic work up, he should do it in consultation with a veterinarian who has
experience with bears so that a correct diagnosis and treatment can be initiated.
