ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 PM on
06/03/2015.
The licensee was present when I arrived, but had a previously made appointment and did not have enough time to
complete an inspection. The licensee gave me better days and times of availability.
