by restricting unauthorized humans and animals the size of dogs, skunks and racoons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the nonhuman primates. The fence must be at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure
to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and outside the perimeter fence.
