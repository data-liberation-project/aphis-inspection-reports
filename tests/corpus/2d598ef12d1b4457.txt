INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Two protocols did not contain an adequate rationale for the number of animals to be used.
ACUP 17A-08 calls for 350 rabbits to be used. The explanation for the number of animals states: "Two rabbits per
material are required for a valid USP test. Three rabbits are used in the ISO method. Other implantation studies of
longer duration may use up to six rabbits."
There is no explanation of how, given these numbers, a total of 350 rabbits should be approved by the IACUC for
use under this study.
ACUP 17A-47, under rationale for number of animals, displays a table listing eleven procedures which require two
animals each, and four additional animals as replacements. It also specifies that each rabbit will serve as its own
control.
There is no explanation as to why two animals are needed per procedure, nor how the number four was derived to
serve as replacements.
The IACUC should carefully review animal use proposals, and assure that the protocol proposal contains an
adequate rationale for the number of animals requested for use. Failure to do so could result in unnecessary animal
acquisition and use
To be corrected in these two protocols by 11/1/14, and all active protocols at the time of review.

MISCELLANEOUS.
A review of internal records revealed that a live rabbit was found in the carcass freezer due to a failure of staff
members to verify death following a euthanasia procedure. The incident was reported to OLAW, and appropriate
corrective actions had been taken by management at the time of this inspection.Handling of all animals, including euthanasia, should be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner
that does not cause behavioral stress, physical harm, unnecessary discomfort, or excessive cooling. The facility
should continue to monitor the euthanasia procedures to ensure that SOPs are up to date and being followed, and
that retraining has been successful.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
