Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Four puppies arrived at SFO on KLM flight 605 from Amsterdam – one originating from Poland on waybill 07451878094,
one from Romania on waybill 07451087971, and two in a third crate originating from Hungary on waybill 07451048922.
None of the crates had a consignor's certification regarding feeding and watering displayed on the shipping crate. Failure
to provide this information stating when the animals were last offered food and water, and instructions for feeding and
watering during transport, could put the animals at risk. It is the carrier's responsibility to ensure that this information is
provided at the time that the animals are accepted for transport.
3.15(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Three puppies arrived at SFO on KLM flight 605 from Amsterdam –one from Romania on waybill 07451087971, and two
in a crate originating from Hungary on waybill 07451048922. The crates were not properly labeled, as required, with the
words "LIVE ANIMALS" in letters one inch tall on the top and one or more sides of the crates. Failure to properly label
shipping crates could result in mishandling, which could be harmful to the animals. The carrier is responsible to ensure
that crates are properly labeled when accepting animals for transport.
3.17(c)

Food and water requirements.


Two puppies arrived at SFO on KLM flight 605 from Amsterdam – one originating from Poland on waybill 07451878094,
one from Romania on waybill 07451087971. Each crate had only one receptacle inside the crate where food or water
could be offered, rather than a food and a water receptacle, securely fastened inside the crate, as required.

Failure to ensure that both a food and water receptacle are present in the crates when accepting animal for transport
could result in improper care of the animals. Carriers must ensure that these requirements are met when accepting
animals for transport.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with cargo office personnel representing the airline.
