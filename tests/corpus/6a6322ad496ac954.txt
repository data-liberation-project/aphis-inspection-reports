3.26(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig housing areas causing the inspectors’ eyes and
noses to burn. This was a result of soiled enclosures in need of more frequent cleaning and the vents, doors, and
windows all being kept closed.
Failure to provide fresh air can expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.
3.29(d) DIRECT
FEEDING.
Several of the guinea pig feeders had feces mixed in within the feed. During the inspection, guinea pigs were
observed to climb onto the front of the mounted feeders and reach over to eat from the back of feeders.
All food receptacles shall be kept clean and located so as to minimize contamination of feces. Failure to do so can
lead to the spread of disease, injury by reaching over the feeder to access clean food, or decrease in feeding
activity in order to avoid contaminated food. Correct by sanitizing the feeders and constructing them so that fecal
contamination is minimized. Correct by December 24, 2019.
3.30 REPEAT
WATERING.
Water spigots in several of the pens were enclosed within PVC piping that had a greenish/brown accumulation of
material surrounding the spigot. On the PVC pipe enclosing the spigot for Pen 65, feces were adhered to the
surface of the PVC pipe.
Water sources for guinea pigs shall be placed so as to minimize fecal material and contamination of the water and
all watering receptacles need to be sanitized when dirty. Failure to do so can lead to disease or the avoidance of
water, which can negatively impact the health of the animals. Correct by sanitizing waterers and the PVC pipesenclosing the waterers and continue to sanitize whenever identified to be dirty, at a minimum of once every two
weeks.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Many enclosures in this facility require additional cleaning. Almost all of the enclosures have an accumulation of dirt
and debris in the corners and excessive build-up of fecal material.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
The licensee must thoroughly clean all primary enclosures often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and
debris.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
