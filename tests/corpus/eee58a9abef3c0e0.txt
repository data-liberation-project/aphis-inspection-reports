* There were rodent droppings accumulating on the top of one shelving board located in the feed storage shed.
Lack of an effective program that controls rodents can create unsanitary conditions and lead to potential spread of
disease. The licensee must ensure all areas of the facility are kept clean to promote the welfare of the dogs and
reduce contamination by pests in the feed storage area. Correct by 1/16/15.
* The facility inspection done on 1/8/15 and the exit briefing done on 1/9/15 were conducted with the facility
representative.
