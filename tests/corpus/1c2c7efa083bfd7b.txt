Watering
A group of 9 weaned 10-12 week old puppies did not have access to water at the time of the inspection. The puppies had
recently been moved to a bigger enclosure with a large outdoor yard. Two large water bowls had been filled in the
morning but at the time of the inspection, the water bowls were overturned and in opposite corners of the yard. The
puppies were active and appeared healthy. No panting or lethargy was seen. When the water bowls were filled, all nine
puppies were enthusiastic about the water, got a drink, and walked away. Dogs that do not have access to water are
subject to discomfort and can become dehydrated. Correct by ensuring potable water is continuously available to all dogs
at all times. Corrected at time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
