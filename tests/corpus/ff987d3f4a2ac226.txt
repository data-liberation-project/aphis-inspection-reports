3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Not all of the animals have adequate shelter from inclement weather. During this inspection the majority of shelters
had no bedding of any type in them. Animals such as the raccoon, porcupine, foxes, serval, cougars, pot belly pig
have dog type houses without any flaps or windbreaks to help hold in their body heat. Other animals, such as the
capybara, pig, peccaries, some groups of goats and sheep, and the bovine, have three sided shelters. Although
these shelters provide protection from the rain and winds from certain directions, they do not have any bedding to
help the animals nest and retain body heat.
The temperatures this week and next are unseasonably cold, going down at night to the 20’s degrees Fahrenheit,
with wind chills in the teens. All animals need to be provided bedding of some type during cold snaps to provide
chill protection and prevent discomfort.
To be corrected by 12-28-17.
Time still remains for correction of previously cited 3.128 for bears and cougars.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owner.
