2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The facility is set up so that guests can buy cups of animal food and carrots and then feed the goats, alpaca,
sheep, donkey, camel, deer and giraffe. The exhibits are spread throughout the park and there were not enough
identifiable employees around the specific enclosures where guests are able to feed. This needs to be addressed
and employees stationed at these areas during public times of contact.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** A grivet and a vervet were housed in a room adjacent to the kitchen area of the facility. The area where the
animals are housed is also storing food, boxes of supplies for the park, fans and drinks for the employees. This area
should be designated an animal area and only items needed for their husbandry should be stored in this area to
keep the area neat and free of clutter. This is to promote good housekeeping and husbandry practices for the
animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The refrigerator storing animal diets needs to be addressed. The fridge is dirty and needs to be cleaned. In
addition uncovered meat diets for the carnivores at the facility are stored on shelves above the fruit and vegetable
diets intended for the hoofstock and non human primates at the facility. Fluids from the meat diets are draining to
the bottom of the fridge potentially contaminating the fruit and vegetables. This storage method needs to be
changed and fruit and vegetables stored above the meat diets. This needs to be addressed for the heath of the
animals.
*** The diet prep area needs to be cleaned and items not pertaining to diet prep should be moved out of the area.
There was an abundance of flies in the area and used Pepsi cans were stored in a sink area. These cans could bean attractant to flies and should be discarded in an appropriate manner. In addition multiple other items were stored
in the area that should be moved. This should be a designated animal food prep area to assure the food supplies
are stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation.

3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
*** Since the last inspection, the licensee has acquired a variety of species at the park. All of the hoofstock are fed
"ALL STOCK 16 CRUNCHY (AX)" by Agway which is intended for cattle, horses, sheep and goats. This diet is also
fed to the giraffe, deer, eland, camel, zebra and kangaroo. To assure that this diet does in fact meet the nutritional
needs of all the species it is being fed to, the diet should be assessed and approved by the attending vet.
*** The carnivores (tigers, lions, leopard) are fed a primarily beef muscle meat diet with a vitamin supplement. There
was no directions and nothing written down indicating the animals are receiving the adequate amount of vitamin
supplement. Since a few of the carnivores are juveniles it its imperative that they receive the proper diet in quantity
and nutritive value for their normal growth and development.
The attending veterinarian should assess the diets at the facility to assure that the variety of species at this facility
are receiving diets of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection.
