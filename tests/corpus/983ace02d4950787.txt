FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound, be maintained in good repair to protect animals from injury
and contain animals. The facility that houses two porcupines, the wire flooring that is buried around edges of the
enclosure fence to keep animals from digging out is exposed leaving loose wire that animals could become
entangled in. Also, porcupines have chewed a main structure post that could weaken the structure of the enclosure
fence where they are housed. The owner must repair or replace the exposed wire flooring and the enclosure fence
post to help ensure that animals will not be injured or escape. The owner needs to put into place a maintenance
program that closely monitors the structural strength of this enclose and that any needed repairs are done in a
timely manner. Correct by 10-01-2017.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with owner and Karl Thornton, ACI.
