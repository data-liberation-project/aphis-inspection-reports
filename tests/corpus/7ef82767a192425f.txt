RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Section 2.75(b)(1) Records: Dealer and exhibitor: Records for the number of Djungarian and Robo hamster births
stopped in the month of July. Records must include any offspring born of the hamsters housed at the facility. Birth
records are part of the records reviewed by APHIS officials during the inspection as part of the review of the overall

3.26(c)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Section 3.26(c) Lighting: The florescent ceiling light fixture between the 3rd and 4th rows of enclosure racks has
both light tubes not working. Light from the ceiling fixtures in other areas of the room is not well distributed in this
area making it harder to observe the hamsters and the interior of their enclosures in the 3rd and 4th row. The
licensee must ensure that the animal room has ample light of good quality and well distributed to provide sufficient
illumination to permit routine inspection and cleaning during the entire working day. Correct by repairing or
replacing the non-working light fixture and adding any additional lighting needed to provide good quality and well
distributed light to the animal room. Correct by August 28, 2016.
3.31(a)(2) DIRECT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(2) Cleaning and sanitization of primary enclosures: There were seven enclosures each housing a
male and female Robo hamster that had excessively wet bedding: three in the 4th row, three in the 5th row and one
in the 6th row. Two of the Robo hamsters had very wet hair over most of their body in an enclosure in the 5th row.
Once the APHIS official identified the affected enclosures, the facility escort moved the hamsters to clean, dry
enclosures. Animals housed on wet bedding may become soiled, chilled and ill. The licensee must ensure that the
animals in wet enclosures are moved to clean, dry enclosures to ensure the health and comfort of the animals.
Correct by promptly moving hamsters from enclosures with wet bedding to clean, dry enclosures. Correct from thisday forward.

3.31(b)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: Clean and dirty enclosure lids, water bottles and stoppers are being stored together
along the wall with the sink. Clean and dirty items must be stored separately to prevent contamination and to
ensure that only clean, sanitized enclosures/water bottles are used for the hamsters. Correct by storing
clean/sanitized items in a clean area that is separate from where dirty (to be washed) items are placed. Correct by
August 4, 2016.
