ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12pm on

I arrived at the facility and knocked on the door, called out, left a message for the licensee at the phone number
provided, and waited 30 minutes before leaving.
