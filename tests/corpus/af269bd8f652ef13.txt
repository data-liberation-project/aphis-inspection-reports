ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female shih tzu (tag #61-A) was seen limping on her hind left leg. On closer observation it had some swelling on
the upper side of it and the skin was black and bluish colored. She would pull away (a sign of pain) if light pressure
was put on the paw. The licensee reports that this dog did not have these signs during this morning's observations.
The licensee tried but was unable to contact the attending veterinarian during the inspection. Ensure that this dog is
evaluated by the attending veterinarian and that the veterinarian's prescribed treatment is followed.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A litter of 3 un-weaned puppies were housed in an enclosure that had holes big enoug for feet to pass through when
they got out of their whelping box. Another puppy's whelping box had corners missing its floor so it left holes big
enough for its feet to potentially pass through. To prevent injury, enclosure floors must not allow legs or feet to
pass through. Ensure that floors are constructed and maintained so that dogs' and puppies' feet cannot pass
through.
Note: The licensee moved the litter of 3 puppies and their dam to an appropriate enclosure so that feet are not
passing through and fixed the whelping box so that the puppy wouldn't have feet passing through. Maintain correct
from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
