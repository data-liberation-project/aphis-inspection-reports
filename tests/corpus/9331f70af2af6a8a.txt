NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
The registrant is conducting business as both Unified Pet Transit and Puppy Travelers. Puppy Travelers is not
registered with the USDA. An application packet was sent to the licensee for Puppy Travelers in September 2017
and to date has not been returned. Disposition papers from various breeders have listed Puppy Travelers as their
commercial shipper dating from 9/7/17 to 2/18/18. Upon inspection of Unified Pet Transit, the check-in sheet was
listed as Unified Pet Transit/Puppy Travelers. Registrant is required to notify the AC Regional Director by certified
mail within 10 days of any name changes or other changes in operations that affect its status as a carrier or
intermediate handler to allow for accurate business records and for tracking puppies that are being transported.
