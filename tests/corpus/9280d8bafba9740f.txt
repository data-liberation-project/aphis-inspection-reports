Requirements and procedures.
The registrant failed to re-register on 10/26/2021 but continued to transport in commerce. The inspector contacted the
facility owner on 6/2/2022. They said they were transporting animals.
Failure to register as a transporter does not ensure that the Animal Welfare Act can be enforced and that the animals in
transport are being cared for humanely.
The facility must register to be a transporter prior to transporting any more regulated animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
