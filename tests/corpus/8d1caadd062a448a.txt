3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
A majority of the guinea pig enclosures contained a large accumulation of fecal material and debris with pieces of corn
stalks scattered over the top. The shavings used as primary bedding were barely visible in most of the enclosures.
Failure to clean and sanitize primary enclosures often enough to prevent a buildup of excreta can introduce disease
hazards to the animals as well as create unpleasant odors and attract vermin. The licensee must clean the enclosures as
often as necessary to prevent a build-up of fecal material and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks.
