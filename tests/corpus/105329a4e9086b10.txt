ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1545 on
14-May-18. I went to the zoo and none of the employees working were authorized to do the inspection with me. I
informed the person I spoke with that I would try again another time. I also called the manager and left a message
informing him that I would try to catch him another time.
End of report.
