2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Semi-Annual Report to the Institutional Official.
1. The Semi-annual Report to the IO dated 1/29/17 was sent to the IO containing the signature of only the IACUC
Chairperson.
2. The Semi-annual Report to the IO dated 8/14/17 was sent to the IO containing the signatures of only 3 of the 10
voting members of the IACUC.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC shall prepare reports of its evaluations conducted semi-annually of
the facility and program for animal use and submit the report to the IO. Further, the IACUC is responsible for the
reports that shall be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members. When an IACUC has 10 voting
members, the signatures of at least 6 IACUC members are required before the Semi-annual Report is sent to the
IO. This process ensures that a majority of the IACUC members have reviewed the Report and the IACUC
members were given the opportunity for any minority views to be included.
The IACUC needs to review the 1/29/17 and the 8/14/17 Semi-annual Reports to the IO at the next scheduled
IACUC meeting to be held in 2017, obtain the signatures of at least 6 IACUC members on each of the Reports, and
re-submit the Reports to the IO.
Correct by 10/1/17.
NOTE - Exit briefing held 8/15/17 on-site with facility representatives. Report delivered by e-mail 8/21/17.
