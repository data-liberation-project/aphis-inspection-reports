ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs had excessively matted hair. A female Lakeland Terrier named Annie (3948) had matted hair on her
upper back and shoulders. The mats were twisted near the skin and contained foreign material. A female Lakeland
Terrier named Alice (1497) had matted hair on all four legs, on her back, and under her tail. The mats under the tail
had fecal material entrapped in them. Matted hair can result in skin problems, can be painful, and can compromise
the hair'(cid:25)s ability to provide protection from the heat or cold. The licensee must remove the matted hair from these
animals and must establish an effective program of haircoat maintenance.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter from the Elements.
At least 8 shelters in the outdoor facility did not have adequate wind/rain breaks. The shelters were igloo type
structures with offset tunnels for the entrance. However, in at least 8 of these shelters, the dogs had chewed the
tunnels to the point that they were not providing adequate protection from the wind. Wind/rain breaks are necessary
so the dogs have a dry place that is protected from the wind. The licensee must ensure that all shelters have
adequate wind/rain breaks.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter from the Elements.
One outdoor enclosure had an inadequate amount of shelter for the dogs. The enclosure contained two adult
Lakeland Terriers (Nicky 6948 and Shawnee 1375) and one shelter. The shelter was too small to allow both dogs
to sit, stand, lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. The licensee must add a second shelter or replace the
existing shelter with one that is big enough for both dogs.TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 22, 2016.
The inspection was conducted with two facility representatives. The exit briefing was conducted with the licensee
and the facility representatives.
