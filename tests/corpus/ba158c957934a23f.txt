ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the "North Building" there was a gray and white Shi Tzu adult female (tag # 169) that had a greenish yellow
discharge on the cornea and around the eyelids of the left eye. The "white" of the left eye was more red than the
"white" of the right eye. The center of the surface of the eye (Cornea) had a circular area that was white in color.
Eye problems can be due to trauma, infection, and other medical problems and can be painful and affect vision.
The license must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information including the
diagnosis, treatment, and resolution of the condition must be documented and made available to the inspector upon
request.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In eighteen enclosures there was "pegboard" placed on the wire flooring which was showing deterioration and wear
on the surface and edges.
The worn and deteriorated surfaces can not readily be cleaned and or sanitized which can play a role in disease
transmission. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities including houses, dens, and other
furniture type fixtures, and objects within the facility be constructed in a manor and made of materials that allow
them to be readily cleaned and sanitized or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
