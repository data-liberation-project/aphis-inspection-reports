ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult female Havenese (microchip # 103379011) was again noted to have overgrown nails and a female
Sheltie/American Eskimo (microchip #0A01445342) was also identified as having excessively long nails. Overgrown
nails can result in abnormal gait, broken nails or lameness. Trim the nails of these dogs and maintain appropriate
methods of care such as regular nail trims to prevent them from being overgrown and to provide for the dogs'
overall health and well-being.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Time and method of identification.
There are five dogs recently acquired that do not have official USDA identification. This does not allow for
identification of individual animals and may hinder tracking of the animals. The licensee has approval to use
microchips as their official identification. The above dogs must be microchipped so that they are properly identified.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces--General requirements.
There are a few areas of metal where the rust is becoming excessive. This includes the following areas: The bottom
support pipes for the enclosures along the inside west wall of the kennel building on four enclosures housing 12
dogs total, some of the screws on the doggie door hinges in the last two enclosures on the left upon entering the
building with four dogs total, the top edge of the wire mesh where the vinyl coating has come off along the bottom of
the access door for the bottom enclosure with four dogs on the right as you enter the building, the round metal
pieces securing the wire mesh enclosure sides and floors together for the three wire mesh enclosures with a total ofeight adult dogs and five puppies, and the metal pieces securing a PVC pipe in the back right corner of one
enclosure along the west inside wall. Excessive rust may not allow for proper cleaning and sanitizing and may affect
structural strength as the surface deteriorates from the rust. Remove, repair, or replace rusted surfaces to ensure
structural strength and to allow for required cleaning and sanitizing. Correct by 24 September 2014.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner.
