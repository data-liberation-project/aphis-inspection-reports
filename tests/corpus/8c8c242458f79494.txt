2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Authority of attending veterinarian: The current treatment protocol for eye infection and abscess problems with
oxytetracycline was obtained from a consulting veterinarian that does not visit the facility. The dose and frequency
being used do not match the written literature that the facility has on hand. We contacted the local veterinarians
that visit the facility and could not verify that the current dose and frequency in use (which is less than the literature
recommendation) is adequate for the conditions being treated. The licensee must ensure that the attending
veterinarian that has formally agreed to make regularly scheduled visits to the facility is aware of consultant
recommendations and prior to beginning consultant-recommended medications the attending veterinarian has been
given the authority to oversee the treatment of the animals at the facility.
Correction: Work with the attending veterinarian and obtain and follow clear treatment instructions for the
oxytetracyline and ensure that treatment protocols are approved by the attending veterinarian.
Correct and clarify prior to further use of oxytetracycline.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 29 animals that we observed that the facility had identified and were treating (mostly for eye conditions)
prior to inspection; however there were four females (in enclosures 146A, 107A, 106C, and 119A) that had collars
embedded in their neck tissue. The licensee removed their collars and the skin was eroded, there was matted hair
and open lesions with visible redness and a pale liquid/granualar discharge that was seen in the lesions. These
conditions were chronic serious conditions that were pointed out to the licensee during the inspection. The facility
must have the attending veterinarian see these animals to ensure that proper treatment is given to prevent pain or
worsening problems. A method of daily observations must be made that can prevent these type of collar injuries in
the chinchillas.
Non-direct non-compliances:
-Four chinchillas had eye problems that had not been noticed previous to inspection. They had squinting eyes, mildswelling and some pale discharge and some had some crusting around the eye. The licensee added enclosure
tags that indicate that these need to be on the treatment protocol. Ensure that daily observations are continually
improved to find and treat these animals per the attending veterinarian's instructions.
-A juvenile chinchilla (the smaller of triplets housed in 78B) was missing hair on its nose and the skin had some
scabs. This condition had not been identified by the facility and does not appear to be a recent injury/acquired
condition and still needs to be communicated to the attending veterinarian to see if further evaluation or any
treatment is needed. Ensure daily observations are improved to find and report these types of conditions to the
attending veterinarian promptly.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee pointed out and demonstrated that many enclosures are being replaced/repaired as a routine practice,
however; four chinchilla enclosures were in disrepair during the time of inspection and dust boxes and feeders in
the enclosures are in need of repair or need to be replaced:
-Three enclosures had holes in the floor with points exposed to the chinchillas. Some holes were large enough they
could potentially get out. Note: The licensee moved the animals in these enclosures to other enclosures that did not
have holes and points in them during the inspection.
-A young chinchilla was seen going through a hole in the feeder area into the neighboring enclosure. The young
chinchilla went back to its mother and then the licensee repaired the hole to securely contain it.
-Multiple dust boxes had rust and rough edges; the licensee replaced 4 of the worst affected during inspection.
-Most of the feeders front edges have rusted to the extent that rough and sharp edges are exposed to the
chinchillas.
Holes in enclosures, sharp points, and rusted dust boxes and feeder edges could cause injury to the chinchillas.
Ensure that items and enclosures are repaired or replaced to protect the health of the chinchillas.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
