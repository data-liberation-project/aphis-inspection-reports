2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male Chihuahua (microchip # 067530595) and a female Chihuahua (#070629858) were again noted to have
excessively long nails with the male's having grown to a length that they are beginning to curve.
Failure to maintain appropriate methods of care such as regular nail trims can result in abnormal gait, broken nails
or lameness. Trim the nails of these dogs and maintain on a regular basis to prevent them from being overgrown
and to provide for their well-being.
The licensee trimmed these dogs' nails during the inspection.
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Time and method of identification.
The seven enclosures with weaned puppies housing a combined total of 24 puppies did not have identification.
Lack of identification does not allow for the animals to be identified by the inspectors. Provide identification for all
weaned puppies with an official tag or with a plastic-type collar or cage card attached to the enclosure containing
the information required on an official tag. Correct from this point on.
2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is using a computerized system to maintain the information required by this section; however, they do
not have an approved variance to use a computerized system in replace of APHIS Form 7005 (Record ofAcquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand).
Without an approved variance, this does not ensure that the computerized system being used meets the
requirements of this section. Request a variance to use the computerized records or maintain records on the
required form (APHIS Form 7005). Correct by July 5, 2014.
3.6(c)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures. Additional requirements for dogs--Space.
There were two enclosures with five weaned puppies in each that did not provide the minimum amount of required
floor space. For instance, one enclosure measured 30 inches by 36 inches providing a total of 7.5 sq. ft. of floor
space. The puppies in this enclosure measured 11.5 inches in length and require a total of 10.6 sq. ft. of space.
Inadequate space may affect their comfort and limit the opportunity for exercise. The puppies must be moved to a
larger enclosure that provides the minimum required floor space or if maintained in the same size enclosures, must
be divided amongst multiple enclosures to meet space requirements. Correct by June 6, 2014.
Dog #026104066 documented under 2.40(b)(2) on the previous inspection dated August 1, 2013 has been
addressed.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner.
