ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:50pm on
06-Sep-18.
I arrived at the facility at 12:50pm. I knocked on the door and waited. There was no answer so I honked my horn
several times and tried calling the number in the file. The phone rang with no answer until the call was
disconnected. I was unable to leave a voicemail. I waited at the facility for an hour. I knocked on the door and called
the phone number again, with no answer. I left the facility at 1:55pm.
