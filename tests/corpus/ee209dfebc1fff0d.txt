2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The walkway into the new observation building where the public can view the 2 mountain lions does not have
adequate barrier along the sides. The public can walk right up to the mountain lion enclosure along the left side.
Along the right side the picket fence is falling down which would allow the public to be able to reach across touch or
put fingers inside of the enclosure.
Along the dirt road on the back southeast side of the enclosure housing one raccoon is an open gap between the
dead cactus that the public has access to walk right up to the enclosure.
These barriers do not adequately assure the safety of the animals and the public from possible injuries. Ensure that
barriers are of sufficient distances between the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the
public.
