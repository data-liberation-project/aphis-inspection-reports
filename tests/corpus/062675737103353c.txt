Although rodent poison was placed in adjacent chicken cages, there are colonies of field mice in both rabbit
enclosures. Numerous mice were observed running around the two enclosures holding 3 and 4 rabbits. There are
mounds of hay in the enclosures and the mice are hiding in it. Hay and mice nest were removed during this
inspection. A more effective pest control program needs to be established and maintained to prevent potential
disease hazards. To be corrected by 5-8-15.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Although the licensee has been working on water drainage issues in several enclosures throughout the zoo, two
areas still are not draining adequately. It rained here all day yesterday and today several large puddles are at the
front of the enclosure with two tigers, and the sand is wet all along the front. The double sided enclosure with two
black bears next to the tigers is still excessively wet and muddy. There are several large puddles in the two
enclosures and the entire ground is muddy. A suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess water needs to be
implemented in these enclosures.
To be corrected by 5-30-15.
