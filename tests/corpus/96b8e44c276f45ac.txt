FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the llama, sheep and goat pen, there are multiple areas on the fence that have wires loose or sticking out. The
loose wires have the potential for an animal to scratch themselves or otherwise cause injury. The outdoor housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. A
system of maintenance must be in place to ensure that the primary enclosures are maintained in good repair.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on 26 August, 2016.
