3.126(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The new runs extending outside of the indoor housing do not have a perimeter fence around it. A perimeter fence
of at least 6 feet in height and no closer than 3 feet from the outside runs needs to be installed. This perimeter
fence acts as a secondary containment and prevents wild animals direct access to the servals.
