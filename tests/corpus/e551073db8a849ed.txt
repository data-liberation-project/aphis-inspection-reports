2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male Chihuahua "Rocky" has poor dental health. Nearly half of the surface of the upper left canine tooth and nearly
the entire surface of the upper left cheek teeth are encased in a thick buildup of dark brown tartar. The upper left
cheek teeth are loose and moved freely when the inspector applied gentle pressure to them. The gums appeared
slightly reddened. At the time of the inspection, this dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and no
treatment plan has been established. Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the animal as well as
lead to further health issues.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The facility must ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
