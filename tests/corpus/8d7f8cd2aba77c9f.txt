FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
In the animal enclosure containing 12 sheep, 13 goats, one axis deer, and one llama, on the side of the shelter
there is metal tin siding that is peeled away from the shelter structure exposing the sharp ends of the metal tin and
gaps large enough for animals to get their hooves/foot caught and potentially cause injuries.
Maintain outdoor facilities so that it is structurally sound and good repair to protect animals from injury.
