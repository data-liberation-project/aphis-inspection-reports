2.131(d)(3)

Handling of animals.
During public elephant rides a handler was not always in direct control of the elephant when members of the public were
present. Although this inspection was conducted in the winter months when the park was closed to visitors, photographs
were provided to USDA officials from Elephant rides conducted in August 2021. The elephant rides are conducted in a
large ring with the elephant walking a path around the inner perimeter of the fence. In the photographs, while the elephant
was providing rides to the public, the handler was either not visualized or seen in the center of the yard, multiple feet from
the elephant. After presentation of the photos to the facility, facility representatives confirmed that occasionally the handler
will stay in the middle of the ring while the elephant is giving rides. Standing a large distance away from the elephant
during rides does not allow the handler to be in direct control of the animal at all times while the public is present.
Correct by 1 March 2022 by ensuring that during public exhibition the elephant is always under the direct control and
supervision of a knowledgeable and experienced animal handler for the safety of the public and the animal.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representatives.
