3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on the exterior fiberglass walls of an estimated 13
enclosures. An estimated thirty dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located on the exterior walls of sheltered
housing. The affected area covers approximately 20 to 25 percent of the wall area. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to
prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that
could lead to potential disease or health risks. Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly increase the risk of
disease hazards for the dogs. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces of housing
facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot cleaned daily and
sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (B) of this sub part to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.
