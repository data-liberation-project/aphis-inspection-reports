INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In Building 10 multiple rooms need to be addressed. Rooms (1010, 1013, 1015, 1016, 1018) have paint peeling off
the back and side walls, along the door and around the window viewing areas. Room 1013 has paint peeled off the
ceiling as well. These areas are no longer imperious to moisture and need to be addressed to facilitate cleaning of
the rooms.
Room 1016 has three vent shoots that have rust underneath the vents and the sides along the vent are no longer
sealed and impervious to moisture.
Room 1014 has caulk stripped along the inside doors exposing unsealed wood that is previous to moisture.
A door between rooms 1015 and 1016 has a gap along the bottom of the door were caulk is peeled away and there
is debris and moisture in the door area creating softness in the base of the metal door.
In building 14, rooms 1403 and 1405 have areas of the door where there is exposed metal and rusted areas that are
no longer impervious to moisture.
These rooms in these buildings need to be addressed so indoor surfaces in contact with animals are impervious to
moisture.
