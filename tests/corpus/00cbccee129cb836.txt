2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The licensee moved to a new address and did not notify Animal Care of his change of address. The licensee is currently
operating his kennel from an unapproved site. Conducting regulated activity from an unapproved site does not allow
APHIS Officials to know the location of the animals and does ensure optimal animal welfare and well-being. The licensee
shall notify Animal Care no fewer than 90 days and obtain a new license before any change of address. Correct by:
October 13, 2021.
