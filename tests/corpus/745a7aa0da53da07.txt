Feeding.
An incident occurred that involved five adult Mongolian gerbils and resulted in the death of one of the animals on October
4, 2021. The animals were assigned to a study and undergoing regulated access to their daily ration to encourage them
to conduct behavioral tests for food rewards. A verbal request for services by a laboratory staff member to the husbandry
supervisor was not communicated to the husbandry technician responsible for feeding in the room. Consequently, five
animals were not given their daily ration on October 2, 2021. The problem was identified on October 3, 2021 and the
animals were immediately provided food. In addition, the veterinarian was notified and conducted a physical exam.

According to the facility, four of the five gerbils were bright and alert. One animal, however, presented as lethargic and
was administered fluids by the veterinarian. The animal's condition improved and all five animals consumed their rations
provided on October 3rd. On October 4th, when the veterinarian rechecked the gerbils, the same animal was again
lethargic. Thermal and nutritional support were administered, but the animal died shortly after on October 4, 2021.

Animals must be given food as required to ensure their health and comfort. These animals were under an IACUC-
approved protocol describing how food was to be provided and the amount of the daily ration to be given to each animal.


The miscommunication resulted in a deviation from the protocol's requirements. The facility has enacted a corrective
action plan. Correct from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
