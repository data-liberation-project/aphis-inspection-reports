*** The wolf hybrid has several large areas of mated fur hanging down by the hind legs. Once the fur becomes
matted, it pulls and separates from the body, which can cause skin irritation. Additionally, the fur no longer
adequately protects the animal from the elements. These mats need to be removed to prevent these issues and for
the comfort of the animal.
