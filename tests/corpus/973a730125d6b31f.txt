Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
* A female opossum approximately 3.5 years old has a head tilt, unsteady gait, skin abrasions and hair loss. The
opossum has a right head tilt and was observed moving very slowly around her enclosure with a stiff and uncertain gait.
While standing still, her lower jaw quivered and she was making chittering noises. There is a large portion of hair missing
on her back along with multiple scabs. Scabs and sores are also present along the tail, right cheek, and under her jaw on
the left side. According to the licensee, she is a very old opossum and was briefly placed in a different outdoor enclosure.
They found her with the scrapes/sores and moved her into her current enclosure. The licensee is currently applying
entederm ointment but has not contacted the attending veterinarian. An older animal with multiple abrasions and scabs,
along with signs of mobility and possible neurologic issues can indicate discomfort, pain, stress, or other underlying
conditions/diseases.
Frequent and direct communication with a veterinarian is paramount to ensuring animals nearing the end of their life still
have an adequate quality of life and their specific needs are being recognized and provided for.

*An adult, male goat has a large split in the wall of his outside left front hoof. Abnormalities in the hoof wall can lead to
chronic hoof problems, conformation issues, lameness, and further pain and suffering. This animal's condition was not
noted by the facility during daily observations. Hoof wear needs to be monitored and addressed for preventative care.

Correct by having the hoof evaluated by a professional and determine an appropriate course of action to correct the hoof
wall.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is still not maintaining accurate records of animals on hand, acquisitions, and dispositions. For example, two
fennec foxes were sold and the required information including address and date of sale was missing on the paperwork.
Records are also missing for offspring born on the premises and therefore cannot be matched to provided dispositions
records. These are most frequently the small pocket pets (hedgehogs, degus, sugar gliders, etc.). There is also an
armadillo that was acquired recently with no paperwork. These recordkeeping deficiencies need to be addressed in a
timely manner to allow for animal traceability and accurate inventory.
3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The female wolf hybrid is heavily matted behind the ears, around the neck and along the back legs. Matted fur pulls and
separates from the skin which can be painful and no longer acts as an insulator against heat or cold temperatures. A
preventative program for these wolf hybrids should include brushing and grooming to ensure healthy skin and hair coats
for their comfort and wellbeing.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the male ring-tailed lemur enclosure, there is a wooden framed panel with wire mesh that has excessive accumulations
of debris and can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized. The bottom of the wood board is discolored and
covered in hair, dirt, and debris. The wood is no longer impervious to moisture and cannot be cleaned and sanitized.


Areas in contact with non-human primates must be replaced when worn or cleaned and sanitized to reduce disease
hazards, insects, pests, and odors.

3.87(a)(3)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
Two marmosets being transported to a show are housed in a bird cage with wire bars that are spaced apart, allowing
them to easily reach their arms and limbs through the bars. Non-human primates that can reach outside of their
enclosures during transport are at risk of serious injury if sudden movements or shifts occur while in motion. Future
transports for these animals must ensure that all non-human primates are transported in enclosures that do not allow
them to put any part of their body outside the enclosure in a way that could result in injury to the animal.

Facilities, general.
*** The potbellied pig enclosure still has a piece of plastic fencing disconnected from the metal fence and laying in the
pasture.
*** The cavy’s in the 4 square enclosure have white peg board that is chewed and black plastic fence that is chewed. The
cavy in the building also has black plastic inside the mesh that is chewed.
These enclosures need to be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals and to reduce chewing and possible
ingestion hazards.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.

*** There was an accumulation of feces in the binturong and fox enclosure that needs to be removed. The feces were old
with mold apparent on the feces.
*** The spiny mice and degu aquarium style enclosures need to be cleaned more frequently. There was a buildup of feces
and the majority of bedding was wet with a strong ammonia odor coming from the top screen.
These enclosures need to be cleaned more frequently to reduce this accumulation of feces, reduce strong odors, and
minimize disease hazards for the health of the animals.
