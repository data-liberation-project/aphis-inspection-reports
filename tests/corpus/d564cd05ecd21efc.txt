Watering.
The water receptacles for the alpaca, llama, goat, horses, cows, and sheep that are housed at the Veterinary Teaching
Hospital are not clean and sanitary. All of these receptacles have a green coating on the interior surface in contact with
the water. Failure to provide a clean water receptacle can lead to water that becomes contaminated and animals that are
reluctant to drink as often as they normally would. The registrant must ensure that all water receptacles be kept clean and
sanitary.

Sanitation.
-There is an area of poor drainage in the shelter structure of the teaching llama/alpaca enclosure. This mud has started to
grow algae and is attracting flies.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the teaching horse shelter structure that completely covers half of the floor space.
-There is an accumulation of feces and deteriorating bedding that has been raked up for collection but remains adjacent
to the length of the feed bunk in the outdoor portion of the sheep barn. This is attracting large numbers of flies.
Areas of poor drainage and accumulations of excreta are especially of concern when they occupy an animal's shelter


structure or interfere with its access to food and water sources. These areas also attract pests and can play a role in
disease transmission. The registrant must ensure that excreta be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary
to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and odors.

Sanitation.
There are rodent feces on the shelf and the floor of the equine shed at the Veterinary Teaching Hopsital. This shed is
used to store food bins and other husbandry items for use with the teaching horses. A facility representative stated that
there are rodent bait stations in the shed but was unsure when they had last been serviced. Rodents play a role in
disease transmission. The registrant must ensure that a safe and effective program for the control of insects,
ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests is established and maintained.
