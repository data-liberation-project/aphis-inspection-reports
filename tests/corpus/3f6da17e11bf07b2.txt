ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Multiple adult dogs were observed with significant matting. The matts on these dogs were flattened and contained
brownish organic material. Extensive matting was observed on the rear quarters and underbelly of these dogs. The
affected dogs included 4 shi tzus ( microchip numbers 0A02087951, 0A019144204, 491-171-5A36, 0A02090029), 3
poodles (microchip numbers 493-159-3930, 0A01361954, 0A02552120). These dogs must be properly groomed to
remove matted areas. Matted hair contributes to potential skin problems, discomfort, and sanitary issues for the
affected dogs. To be corrected by: 04/08/18

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two enclosures on the south side of the building were observed with puddles of water in the outside enclosure
areas. Additional gravel or better drainage must be provided in these enclosures to allow the dogs to stay dry. All
dogs in both enclosures had wet hair coats at the time of inspection. Standing water in enclosures poses sanitary
hazards as well causing issue with clean hair coats. To be corrected by: 04/08/18

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor gravel runs were observed with at least two days accumulation of feces. The dogs were observed
stepping on the feces and soiling their haircoats. All enclosures must have the feces removed from the enclosure
on a daily basis to reduce disease, odor and pest hazards. To be corrected by: 04/03/18
