3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are three runs that have cracks that run the length of the runs, from the cement wall to the gates. The cracks
are not sealed or filled and are a reservoir for dirt and debris that can not be sanitized properly.
Cracks in cement that are not repaired can provide a source of dirt and debris buildup and exposure to bacteria that
can not be cleaned away or sanitized according to Sec 3.11(b), possibly exposing the regulated animals to future
health issues.
The cracks in the cement needs to be repaired and sealed in order to allow for proper cleaning and sanitization and
management of the primary enclosure.

3.1(d)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is no lighting in the indoor portion of the facility, windows line the walls on both sides of the kennel however
the light is not enough to illuminate the indoor primary kennels. A flashlight was needed to conduct the inspection in
the kennel in order to see the floor space, feeders and cleanliness of the primary enclosure, as well as to be able to
see the adults or puppies in those wall kennels.
It is important that there is a light source that adequately illuminates each primary enclosure to ensure that proper
cleaning of all surfaces is being maintained and to conduct efficient health checks on all animals when they are
inside. Low light conditions could cause an illness or injury to go unnoticed and for improper cleaning or
maintenance of surfaces to go unobserved.
The licensee must put in a light source that will illuminate the primary enclosures inside the facility in order to allow
for proper cleaning and health checks of the animals. To be corrected by: October 22, 2014

WATERING.
There are four outdoor enclosures that house a total of 17 dogs that have four plastic water buckets that are lined
with a film of dark green algae along the sides and bottom of the buckets.
It is important that all water buckets are kept clean and sanitized on a regular basis in order to prevent the buildup of
algae or accumulation of dirt and debris in the drinking water. Algae can be a source of illness or disease if it is not
cleaned out of the water containers, and algae in the buckets can not be sanitized.
The water buckets must be cleaned and sanitized in accordance with Sec 3.11(b) on a regular basis to prevent the
accumulation of algae, dirt and debris.
