PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors and walls of the enclosures in the gorilla/mandrill holding building have varying degrees of worn paint
which has now exposed the underlying porous/pitted concrete floors & walls. These surfaces appeared wet and do
not appear to dry quickly due (partly due) to the porous nature of these surfaces. There was also a moderate foul
odor in these areas. The primates do have contact with these surfaces.
These surfaces can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized or easily replaced due to the porosity and/or
worn conditions. All enclosures shall enable all surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates to be readily cleaned
and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.84(b)(3) of this subpart, or replaced when worn or soiled.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The plywood ceiling in the pudu barn has deteriorated due to the roof leaking water. This ceiling has dark and white
areas which are frequently indicative of a water leakage with resulting mold, mildew, fungus, &/or algae. This
ceiling also appears soft and may no longer be structurally sound. The water leakage has also caused an issue
with the GFI outlets getting wet. This may also cause fires, sparking, or other electrical risks to the animals.
The hyrax/bat holding has chipping flaking walls which is exposing the underlying concrete in one of the suspended
wire enclosures, as well as on a portion the walls of the building. The flaking of the paint in the enclosure poses an
ingestion risk to the bats, and the other areas do not facilitate a proper cleaning of the building.
All housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Water is not draining rapidly in the following areas: Kudu/bontebok holding, bongo/duiker holding, lion holding and
pudu holding barns. In all cases, the wet & muddy areas are such that these animals have to go through it to gain
access to food, water &/or shelter.
These areas have had a history of not rapidly draining rainwater from these areas due to terrain. A suitable method
shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Consult with a professional engineer about methods to rapidly
drain water away from the barns if warranted.
