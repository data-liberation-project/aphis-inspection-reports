RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There was no record available which fully and correctly disclosed the required information on the acquisition of one
adult hedgehog named "Rika" who was at the facility during the time of inspection. Licensee stated that she was
temporarily taking care of the hedgehog for another person. The record of acquisition must include the name,
address, USDA license number and date of acquisition, including any offspring. Maintaining current records of
animals on hand, including those acquired and disposed of, is required in order to be able to accurately track the
animals.
Make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding the
acquisition and disposition of all the animals.

SANITATION.
(c) Housekeeping. Inside a room in the basement where the 4 adult chinchillas are being housed is an excess
accumulation of equipment (i.e. animal carriers, glass tanks, bags of tubes, box with supplies etc.) being stored next
to the cage. These conditions are unsanitary and not appropriate in animal housing area as they can attract pests
which can potentially carry infectious diseases and impedes proper housekeeping inside the basement room and
around the animal's enclosure.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals and to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
