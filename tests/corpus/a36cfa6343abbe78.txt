2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
At the farm exhibit, the public is allowed to walk directly up to the primary enclosures that contain goats, sheep, cows, and
pigs with no attendants or public barriers present. The primary enclosures’ fences and gates are approximately 4 feet
high with spacing between the rails that allow hands or arms to reach through and touch the animals. Recently, a
member of the public was nipped by one of the pigs. Unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction
with the animals and may lead to injury of the public and/or the animals. The licensee must ensure that during periods of
public exhibition, animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general
viewing public to help assure the safety of animals and the public.
