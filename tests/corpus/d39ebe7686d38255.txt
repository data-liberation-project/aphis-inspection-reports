ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white, male Poodle, approximately 11 years old and identified by microchip (#037-822-050), has a thick buildup of
tarter covering the surface of its cheek teeth. These teeth are not easily visible because of the abnormal buildup of
material covering the surface. The layer of tarter coating the affected teeth has a dark brown appearance.
Additionally, there are areas of gum recession along the top of the cheek teeth.
The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures, be painful,
impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and harm the health of the animal.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. Additionally, the licensee needs to consult the attending veterinarian to develop and follow a dental
maintenance plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
*The dog listed above received veterinary care at the time of inspection. This non-compliant item has been
corrected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
