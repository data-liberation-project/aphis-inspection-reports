2.31(b)(3)(ii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The facility did not have a fully constituted Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) for over six months in
2021. Between June 2021 and December 2021, the IACUC held seven meetings. Review of the monthly meeting minutes
showed that the appointed unaffiliated (community) member of the IACUC was absent from every meeting. The
community member is someone who is not affiliated in any way with the facility other than as a member of the IACUC and
provides representation for general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals. The lack of
participation of an unaffiliated IACUC member in IACUC functions means that the general community interest is not being
represented. The IACUC, when conducting business required under the AWA, shall include at least one member
unaffiliated with the facility. A new community member was appointed in January 2022. Correct by ensuring that an
unaffiliated member provides representation for the general community interests on the IACUC. To be corrected by March
31, 2022.
2.33(b)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
The Attending Veterinarian and Animal Research and Care Division (ARCD) veterinarians do not have the appropriate
equipment to treat animals in the event of an emergency which requires euthanasia. Several representatives from the


facility expressed concern regarding the ARCD veterinarian’s lack of access to euthanasia solution which prevented a
sick calf from being humanely euthanized in a timely manner. While on a study involving neonatal dairy calves, a four-day
old calf became severely ill and was not improving with clinical treatment. On presentation to the ARCD veterinarian, the
calf was lying on its side and having difficulty breathing. The decision was made to euthanize the calf, but the ARCD
veterinarian did not have access to euthanasia solution. At this time, no designated College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM)
veterinarian or researcher was available to supply euthanasia solution. Instead, the calf was treated with a sedative to
address its suffering until a CVM veterinarian arrived an hour and a half later to euthanize the calf.
When animals are sick or injured and in need of emergency care, access to drugs such as euthanasia solution is critical
to avoid prolonged suffering or unnecessary distress to the animals.
Correct by ensuring that the Attending Veterinarian and ARCD veterinarians have access to appropriate drugs needed to
treat diseases and injuries. To be corrected by: March 3, 2022.
3.13(a)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs does not specify a minimum frequency for which the Attending
Veterinarian (AV) will visit the areas that animals are housed to assess the adequacy of veterinary care and other aspects
of animal care. Failing to address the frequency and/or timing of regularly scheduled visits may lead to excessive intervals
between visits or gaps in the assessment of care being provided to animals at the facility. Correct by ensuring that the
written PVC specifies a minimum frequency for regularly scheduled visits by the AV. To be corrected by: March 3, 2022.
3.137(a)(4)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The transport enclosures used by study staff on protocol 20-150 to successfully transport 88 hibernating Big Brown Bats
acquired out of state to the facility in the fall of 2021 have insufficient ventilation openings. The only air ingress/egress is


via the space between the top lid and the enclosure. The approved protocol does not address ventilation in the description
of the transport enclosures. Adequate ventilation is necessary to ensure that enough fresh air is available for the health
and well-being of the animals. Ventilation openings shall be located on two opposite walls of the primary enclosures and
the ventilation openings on each wall shall be at least 16 percent of the total surface area of each such wall or there shall
be openings located on all four walls and the openings on each of the walls shall be at least 8 percent of the total surface
area of each such wall. At least one-third of the openings shall be located on the lower one half of the enclosure and one-
third on the upper one half of the enclosure. Correct by ensuring ventilation openings meet the requirements or that the
IACUC has approved an exception to the standard when such exception has been specified and justified in the protocol to
conduct the activity. To be corrected by September 1, 2022 or prior to transport of any bats.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC Representative and other facility representatives.
