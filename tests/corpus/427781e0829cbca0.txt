2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two non-human primates need to be evaluated by a veterinarian:
*1)A female marmoset named "Sissy" has a freshly clotted wound about an inch from the tip of her tail. The extent
of the wound could not be seen because of the surrounding hair. Dried blood was present on the enclosure bars,
the fabric nestbox and the wall behind the enclosure.
A veterinarian needs to examine the wound to determine the treatment necessary. Correct by 12/3/16.
*2) The male red-handed tamarin appears thin overall and through his face. The hair is missing from his entire tail.
The facility representative reports that he was extremely thin when acquired at an auction in Sept. 2015 and has
gained some weight since. The facility took a stool sample to the vet for a fecal check but has not had the tamarin
examined. A discussion about the current feeding plan shows many varied food items are being fed. The tamarin
was observed eating during the inspection.
A veterinarian needs to examine the tamarin to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan for the thin body
condition. The tamarin's diet shall also be reviewed as part of the examination by a veterinarian to verify that it is
nutritionally complete. Correct by 12/10/16.
3.80(b)(2)(iv)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One enclosure currently houses three marmosets. The enclosure floor space measures 28inx20in for a total floor
space of 3.89 sq ft. The required floor space for three marmosets would be 1.6 sq ft x3 or 4.8 sq ft. Adequate floor
space is necessary to provide sufficient space for species-typical behaviors, locomotion and exercise. When more
than one non-human primate is housed in a primary enclosure, the minimum space requirement is the sum of the
minimum floor area space required for each individual non-human primate. Correct by 1/2/17.3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Several sugar glider cages did not provide enough space for all the gliders housed within. One enclosure measuring
12inx14inx12in housed thirteen young sugar gliders. Two enclosures measuring 24inx16inx16in each housed eight
adult sugar gliders. The pouches in which the gliders were sleeping took up most of the cage space leaving no
room for normal sugar glider social adjustments or movements such as climbing or gliding. The sugar gliders shall
be housed in an enclosure that provides sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Correct by 1/2/17.
