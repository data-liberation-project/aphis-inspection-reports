CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* A mixture of dog hair and cobwebs were observed accumulating an estimated 30 percent of the welded wire
flooring in two enclosures. Three dogs are in contact with the affected area which is located on the exterior runs
attached to sheltered housing. The accumulation of dog hair and cobwebs create an unsanitary living condition
that could impact the health and well-being of the dogs. It indicates a potential living area for other pests that are
housed with the dogs. The licensee must ensure that premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk,
waste products and discarded matter. In addition, buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept clean and in
good repair to protect the animals from injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices required in this sub part and to
reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents, other pests and vermin. Correct by 9/20/17.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 9/6/17 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
