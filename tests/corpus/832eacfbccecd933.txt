2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
I had an appointment today with the attending veterinarian to discuss what is required of the licensee to meet the
regulation for Attending Veterinary Care. Specifically the written program of veterinary care, the attending
veterinarians authority and daily observations. The attending veterinarian stated that his veterinary
recommendations have not been followed in the past.
Each exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
veterinary care.
All written and verbal instructions for veterinary care made by the attending veterinarian must be followed to ensure
the health and well-being of the animals kept at the facility.
To be corrected now on.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees wife.
