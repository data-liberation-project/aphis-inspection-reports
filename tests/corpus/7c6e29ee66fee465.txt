Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
During the January 6, 2022 IACUC meeting the following two protocols were reviewed and the IACUC noted that
modifications needed to be made:
*The meeting minutes stated that 'Section D' needed to be updated for SP2016E054005-16.
*The meeting minutes stated that the animal numbers needed to be adjusted and the alternative search was of concern
for protocol FA2018E054005-13.
The IACUC chair made a motion to approve both protocols and the minutes stated that approval was carried by
acclamation.
Protocols requiring modifications cannot be approved by the IACUC prior to the modifications first being made by the
Principal Investigator and resubmitted for review for approval. In order to approve proposed activities or proposed
significant changes in ongoing activities, the IACUC must conduct a review and determine that the proposed activities or
significant changes in ongoing activities meet all AWA requirements. The IACUC shall review all proposed significant
changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities and approve, require modifications to secure
approval or withhold approval. Correct by March 31, 2022.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Expired medications (expired Oct. 2021) were found in the cabinet housing the medications currently being used. They
included two bottles of Lidocaine Injectable and one bottle of Pyrantel oral dewormer. The use of expired medication is
not considered acceptable veterinary practice as the medication may no longer be effective. Corrected during the
inspection-expired drugs removed from cabinet. An in date version of both drugs was available.

This inspection was conducted with facility representatives and the exit interview was conducted with the Interim Director
of Research/Institutional Official.
