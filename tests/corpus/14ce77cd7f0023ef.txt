2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At time of the inspection the 2 young otters were observed exhibiting abnormal behaviors .The male otter “Scooter” was
observed constantly sucking his right front foot .His foot remained in his mouth even when he was walking in the exhibit .
The female otter “Sadie “ was observed repetitively running in a circle around one area of the exhibit . She tossed her
head as she moved . This behavior stopped only briefly before it started again. The animal care manager stated that the
male has always sucked his foot and they had expected him to outgrow it . She stated the stereotypic behavior of the
female began several weeks ago when they changed public feeding from twice a day to allowing it all day .
The attending veterinarian was contacted and stated she had not been contacted nor addressed these behaviors with the
facility and had concerns about them.
There must be a mechanism for frequent communication with the attending veterinarian concerning issues of problems
with animal health ,behavior and well- being.
