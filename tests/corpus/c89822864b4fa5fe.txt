ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At time of inspection the following medication (Safegard) was not labeled appropriately or was not labeled to be
used on dogs. This medication was intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility &
are therefore ready for use. Medications must be labeled with appropriate & accurate information in order to ensure
that the contents of the container can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses & medications
are not used past their expiration dates. As part of the program of adequate veterinary care, the licensee must
consult with the attending veterinarian and ensure that all medications at the facility are labeled with the names of
the medications, the dosage instructions and expiration dates. The licensee must also ensure that the veterinarian
has approved the use of any medications that have not been approved for use in dogs to ensure that proper dosing
and administration is accomplished. This approval must be added to the program of veterinary care at the facility.
This affects 20 adult dogs and 13 puppies. To be corrected by 06-01-14.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
