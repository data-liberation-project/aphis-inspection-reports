INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Description of Procedures to Minimize Pain and Discomfort.
1. Protocol #15-20 that was approved by the IACUC in April 2016 did not contain a description of procedures to
assure that discomfort and pain to the study animals will be limited. The protocol includes surgical procedures
performed under general anesthesia that would be considered more than momentarily painful or distressful to the
animals in the post-operative period. Although it was confirmed that post-operative analgesics were administered to
the study animals used after the protocol was approved and the animals did not exhibit any signs indicative of pain
in the post-operative period, there are no details in the approved protocol for the post-operative analgesia used
such as the name of the drug(s), dose, frequency and route of administration, and duration of treatment.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a proposal to conduct activities involving animals must contain a description of
procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to the animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable
for the conduct of scientifically valuable research, and include provision for the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and
tranquilizing drugs where indicated and appropriate to minimize discomfort and pain to the animals. This
requirement is important so the IACUC can determine during their review of the proposal that all of the components
of the proposed activities related to the care and use of animals minimize pain and distress to the animals.
The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for this protocol.
Correct by 8/1/16.
