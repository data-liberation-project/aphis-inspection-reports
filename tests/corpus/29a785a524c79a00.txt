FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The cheetah yards are enclosed with chain link fencing and a kick-in attached to the top of the fence. The kick ins
are secured to the fences with lacing wire. The lacing wire was excessively rusted, deteriorated and missing in
multiple areas. In the areas of missing wire the kick in was not attached to the top of the fence and was gaping with
visible openings. The fence is not in good repair.
* The metal doors and door frames in the coati mundi and red fox housing facilities are excessively rusted and
deteriorating. The rusted areas are flaking and pieces of metal are missing. The deterioration has caused
compromise of structural integrity.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to protect the animals and safely contain them.
The above areas should be repaired or replaced.
