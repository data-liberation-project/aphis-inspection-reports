2.31(d)(1)(iv)(A) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
IACUC-approved Category D protocols 256, 284, 296, 297, 322, 334, and 337 do not adequately describe the use or type
of analgesia indicated for the potentially painful procedures outlined in these protocols. Not describing appropriate
analgesics to be utilized around painful procedures can lead to unmitigated pain and/or distress for the animals. Per the
regulation, the IACUC shall determine that the proposed activities meet the following requirements: procedures that may
cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals will be performed with appropriate sedatives,
analgesics, or anesthetics.
2.31(d)(4) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
For IACUC-approved Category D protocols 284, 296, 322 and 334, no delivery of written notice of protocol approval or
amendment approval by the IACUC to the principal investigator could be documented. If a proposed activity involving the
use of animals begins or is amended without IACUC approval, the animals may be subjected to inappropriate levels of
pain and/or distress. Per the regulation, the IACUC shall notify principal investigators in writing of its decision to approve
or withhold approval of those activities related to the care and use of animals.
2.31(e)(3) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).


IACUC-approved Category D protocols 256, 284, 296,322 and 337 do not adequately describe significant procedures
proposed to be conducted on the animals. The protocols were approved by the IACUC, despite these procedures’
descriptions being inadequate or missing. Approval of proposed protocols lacking complete animal procedure descriptions
can lead to serious pain, distress or injury to the animals to be utilized on those protocols. Per the regulation, a proposal
to conduct activities involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals.
