ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult white-faced ewe (female sheep) was observed limping on her back left leg. It is not known how long she
has been limping, but the licensee thinks that it most likely started today (7/10/14). Limping can be caused by many
different things and could suggest that an animal is experiencing pain. To ensure appropriate treatment, this ewe
must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and treated according to the veterinarian's treatment plan.
Item was corrected during inspection.
Inspection conducted at Sauk County Fairgrounds.

Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
