2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
On 6/30/17 it was discovered that two bats had died after being mistakenly left in a transport enclosure the week
before, after a routine health check. The facility had already self-reported this incident to USDA, and corrective
measures have already been taken to help prevent a recurrence.
While reviewing the meeting minutes of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) regarding the bat
incident, it was discovered that a ten year old Rhesus macaque monkey, with ID # 38380 was treated for a serious
toe injury on 2/8/17 after escaping from his primary enclosure. Staff reports that during a routine room cleaning
procedure, the two banks of enclosures in the room were left in close proximity to each other, so that another
macaque was able to reach across and unlatch # 38380's door. This latch would have normally been out of reach to
the animals. # 38380 then climbed on top of the enclosure of another macaque, which severely bit the escaped
animal's toe. # 38380 received prompt appropriate veterinary care, and the toe was amputated. Steps have been
taken to retrain employees to prevent a recurrence. # 38380 has fully recovered from the incident and ambulates
normally.
Failure to ensure appropriate handling of animals can result in pain and distress, injury, and/or death. Handling of all
animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that protects the animals from harm.
The facility must continue to ensure that steps are taken and standard operating procedures are developed and
followed in order to minimize the risk of handling incidents such as these.
This was a focused inspection on bats on study at the facility, and one Rhesus macaque monkey.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.Inspection occurred on 8/1/17 (Smith & Schnell) and 8/4/17 (continuation of inspection and exit interview - Smith).
