FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of inspection, there were loose and exposed sharp wires eye level of the facility's camel primary fencing
enclosure. The camel was found chewing on the exposed wires during the inspection. Sharp and loose wires can
pose a potential risk of injury and harm to the animal. The housing facilities must be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect and contain the animal.
** The wires were removed from the enclosure during the inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with APHIS personnel Dr. Simone Tomlinson, VMO and facility
manager and care staff.
