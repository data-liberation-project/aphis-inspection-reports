ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female bulldog, (Emily, ID# 0A02130565) had problems with her right eye. In the center area of the eye (cornea)
there was an area about 1/8 inch wide that was slightly raised and the tissue surrounding it was pale/cloudy in color.
The area around the eyeball was brighter red indicating active irritation. The attending veterinarian was present at
the inspection and said that employees had not reported this dog's problem and that it had not been noticed prior to
inspection. The attending veterinarian reported that he would begin treatment on this dog's eye. Eye problems can
be painful, can have many different causes and if left untreated can get worse. The facility must ensure that eye
problems needing treatment are promptly noticed and treated.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* In the Bulldog Kennel there was 1 inch by 1 inch vinyl wire fasten to the divider panels. The vinyl wire for 10 of
these dividers was not secured along the bottom. In the back corners, where the wire is not secure the corner wire
is broken exposing sharp points. Three enclosures had vinyl wire flooring. The wire is broken in areas and
producing sharp points. These enclosures are not being kept in good repair. The broken vinyl wire that is exposing
sharp points in areas can injure 10 adult dogs housed in these enclosures. The dogs can get stuck in the loosely
secured vinyl wire causing possible injury.
All housing facilities must be maintained in good repair and must be structurally sound. This will prevent injury to
the animals.

3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.* Four metal self-feeders, in the Mastiff Kennel, used to feed eight adult dogs were excessively rusty and pitting
around the area of the feeders where the dogs eat from. These excessively rusty and pitting areas prevents proper
cleaning and sanitization. This can increase the disease potential for the dogs.
All metals surfaces must be free of rust for required cleaning and sanitization. Also, to provide for the structural
strength of the metal surface. This will decrease the disease hazards for the dogs.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* In the Mastiff Kennel, three plastic dog door frames, for three enclosures housing a total of five adult dogs, were
excessively chewed and scratched. There was an accumulation of brown grime in the chewed areas.
In the West Room of the Bulldog Kennel, the back wall for the enclosures on the left side of the room are made out
of fiber board. One enclosure, housing one adult dog, has an approximately 6 inches long by 4 inches wide hole in
the wall or fiberboard. One enclosure, housing one adult dog, black plastic flooring is chewed away along where it
adjoins the vinyl wire. This is creating a gap.
In the East Room of the Bulldog Kennel, one enclosure, housing one adult dog, has PVC pipe fasten along the top
of the divider. This plastic pipe is excessively scratched and chewed. There was dark brown grime in these
chewed areas.
These above mentioned surfaces are not being kept in good repair. These surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized. This can increase the disease potential for the animals.
All surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair. This will allow for required cleaning and sanitization for
the prevention of diseases.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The first three enclosures counting from the north of the Mastiff Kennel had an accumulation of fecal waste. The
plastic framing for the dog doors of four enclosures in the Mastiff Kennel had an accumulation of brown grime on thesurfaces. The back wall and all the dividers inside the Mastiff Kennel had an accumulation of dust, brown grime and
cobwebs. This affected 14 adult dogs housed in these enclosures in the Mastiff Kennel.
The East and West rooms of the Bulldog Kennel had a plastic dividers separating 13 enclosures. One enclosures
had a plastic pipe running along the top of the enclosure divider. These plastic surfaces all had an accumulation of
brown grime on the surfaces. This affected 19 adult dogs. These mentioned surfaces indicates daily-spot cleaning
is not taking place. Therefore, this can increase the disease potential.
All surfaces must be spot-cleaned and sanitized often enough for the prevention of disease hazards and an
accumulation of waste on the surfaces.

3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* In the West Room, of the Bulldog Kennel, two enclosures had gaps in the vinyl wire flooring. The gap for one
enclosure was approximately 14 inches long by 1 inch wide. This was along where the vinyl wire and plastic
flooring join. The other gap was created from broken vinyl coated wire and was approximately 7 inches long by ½
inch wide. These gaps can allow for the two adult dogs housed in these enclosures feet to pass through possibly
injuring the animals.
All mesh and slatted floors must not allow the feet of the dogs to pass through any openings for the prevention of
injury.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Eight metal self-feeders, in the Mastiff Kennel, used to feed 11 adult dogs had an accumulation of brown grime
around the areas of the feeders the dogs eat from. There was an accumulation of cob webs and dust on the
feeders.
In the Mastiff kennel, there were two water buckets with gray cloudy water. There was dirt or debris at the bottom of
the buckets. One bucket had two dead mice floating in the water and the other bucket had one mouse floating in the
water. This can increase the disease hazards for the animals.All food and watering receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized more often for the prevention of debris, dirt, grime
and for dead vermin. This will decrease the disease hazards for the animals.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The husbandry table in the Bulldog Kennel, housing 44 adults and five puppies, had medications and syringes on
top of the table ready for use. There was two soiled towels, numerous dead flies and plastic bags on top of the
table.
The Mastiff Kennel, housing 14 adult dogs had a storage table with watering buckets, feeders, dog food and
medication ready for use. There was an excessive accumulation of brown dust and cob webs on the table and
items stored on it. The back wall and windows behind the table had an accumulation of dust, cob webs and dead
flies on the window ledge. The floor around the table had an accumulation of dirt and debris. There was a kart
used to store a rubber container of dog food and buckets that were ready for use. The lid was not properly fasten to
the top of this rubber container. This kart had an accumulation of cob webs, dirt, debris and dog food on it. The
back wall around the kart and enclosures had an accumulation of brown dust and cob webs. These areas provide
living and breeding areas for insects, pests and other rodents and vermin. This also can taint the medication and
food. The lack of housekeeping can affect the health and well-being of the animals in these buildings.
For the health and well-being of the animals, all housing facilities must be kept clean and free of accumulation of
dirt, debris, trash, cob webs and discarded matter. This will prevent living and breeding areas for insects, pests,
and other rodents and vermin.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* In the Mastiff Kennel, there were two watering buckets with dead mice floating on the water. Two dead mice in
one bucket and one mouse in the other. This indicates there is a pest or vermin problem. There was no pest
prevention in the kennel. These dead pests in the watering receptacles can affect the health and well-being of the
14 adult dogs housed in kennel with these enclosures with the watering buckets.
For the health and well-being of the dogs, a vermin or pest prevention program is needed to minimize the potentialfor vermin or pest.
