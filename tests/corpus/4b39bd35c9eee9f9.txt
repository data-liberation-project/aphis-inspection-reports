ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:45pm on
05-DEC-16.
Arrived at the facility gate and called the licensee, left a message with the time and that I could wait until 3:15 to
hear back and contact phone number. Before leaving, the gate was open, so I entered in order to turn the vehicle
around and spoke to an adult, who informed me that no one was available, so the inspection would have to be
completed at another time.
