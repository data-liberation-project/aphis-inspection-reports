CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A rodent was observed inside the macaque primary enclosure, noticeable by the macaque's attempts to catch it.
Two more were observed inside the macaque enclosure at the feeding area under a chair. A rodent was observed
running across the floor, and many were heard running in the ceiling above, inside the off exhibit holding area for a
macaque, ring tailed lemur, skunk and opossum. A possible rodent burrow was observed inside the lemur's off
exhibit enclosure. A rodent was observed on top of the housing unit for the muntjac's primary enclosure.
Rodents can carry parasites and various diseases that could compromise the health and well-being of non human
primates, as well as any other animals on exhibit. An effective pest control program must be established and
maintained to promote the health and well-being of the animals on exhibit and reduce contamination by pests in
animal areas.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
