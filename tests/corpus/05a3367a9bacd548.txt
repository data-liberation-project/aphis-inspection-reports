2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1226 on
31-Oct-17. I knocked on the door and the licensee answered. She was on her way out and was not available for an
inspection. I told her I would try back another time.
End of report.
