2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection it was observed a photo shoot with a tiger cub, the facility use 2 of the 4 tiger cubs they have
at the time of the inspection. We weigh the smallest of the animals and it had 38 pounds of weight.
The inspector noted an aggressive reaction when the Tiger Cub was moved from its cage to the store to take
photographs. (growling, retracting their ears and using claws trying to escape from the handler)
These tiger cubs are too large, too strong and too aggressive to have direct contact with the public with minimal risk
of harm. When an animal, regardless of age, size or weight has any type of reaction that could cause injury, it
should not be used for exhibitions where the public is in direct contact with the animals.
The licensee must stop all direct contact exhibitions with the tigers that are capable of causing any injuries to the
public.
Correct by: The situation was corrected during the inspection, any direct contact with the tiger cubs including the
photo sessions were canceled.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the Licensee.
