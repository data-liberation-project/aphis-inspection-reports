3.1(c)(1)(ii)

Housing facilities, general.
In the area for the large breed dogs, a piece of wall metal has come loose from the structure so some nail/screw points
are exposed that the dogs could possibly contact. Also, in the sheltered building a divider panel has been pushed away
from a floor brace exposing the metal corners that the adult toy breed dogs could contact. These exposed sharp points
could injure the dogs. Ensure that areas of sharp points are maintained to prevent any injury to the dogs.
