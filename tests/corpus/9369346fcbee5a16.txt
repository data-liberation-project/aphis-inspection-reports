3.56(a)(1)

Sanitation.
The outdoor enclosure of an adult female Jack Rabbit has excess accumulation of excreta to the point that the animal
must step on its own poop in order to access feed and water. Fecal buildup creates unsanitary conditions that can lead to
health issues and the transmission of diseases. Enclosures must be kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs and
other debris by periodic cleaning.

Facilities, general.
A wooden platform inside the outdoor enclosure of an adult male racoon is broken. The animal was seen walking on the
platform that has a hole in the center big enough to fit the racoon's front limbs. The animal can easily slip into the hole
and get injured. Outdoor facilities should be kept in good repair to prevent injury to the animals contained therein. The
platform needs to be repaired or replaced.
