CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Since the last inspection, 10 cats arrived and are in a new sheltered building. Items around the building such as
wood pieces, wire, branches, tall grass, rolls of tarp material need to be cleared away to prevent possible harborage
for pests.
During the inspection, bottom boards were removed from the bottom two walls of the female cat room, allowing
easier cleaning of the area between the boards and the wire wall at the bottom of the solid walls. This area has a
collection of dirt, litter, and debris. All areas around the animal buildings need to be kept free of accumulations of
items which prevent adequate cleaning. To be corrected by 8-7-15.
