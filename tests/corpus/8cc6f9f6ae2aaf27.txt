MISCELLANEOUS.
Inspectors reviewed records pertaining to a juvenile female pig tailed macaque (Animal ID A11W048). On
November 12, 2013, the macaque was injured during the course of being captured for a routine physical
examination. While being captured, the technician grasped the animal by a hind limb which resulted in a physeal
fracture. The macaque received immediate and appropriate veterinary care. Animals must be expeditiously and
carefully handled in order to prevent injury. The facility must ensure that all animals are handled in a manner which
prevents trauma and/or physical harm.
Correct by: This incident was reported by the IACUC and corrective measures have been taken.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Inspectors reviewed records pertaining to a juvenile male pig tailed macaque (Animal ID A11W071). On October 21,
2013 a pigtailed macaque was found dead in an outdoor housing enclosure. Two technicians received an electric
shock while attempting to retrieve the deceased animal for necropsy. The definitive cause of death was due to
electrocution. An electric contractor confirmed that a loose ground wire in the junction box for the heating lamp was
worn through and had contact with the metal junction box, which resulted in electrifying the metal enclosure. All
primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained in a manner which protects the animals from injury. The
facility must alter, repair or replace the aforementioned enclosure, and develop a maintenance plan to ensure that
all enclosures protect the animals housed in the enclosure from injury.
Correct by: This incident was reported by the IACUC and corrective measures have been taken.
3.80(a)(2)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Inspectors reviewed records pertaining to animal loss of containment. On April 5, 2015, a single macaque escapedfrom the primary enclosure due to a broken weld bar. Broken weld bars were the cause of two other separate single
macaque escapes on April 6, 2015 and May 21, 2015. On February 7, 2015, eight macaques escaped due to a
cracked transfer door. The facility must ensure that all enclosures and latches are constructed and maintained in
order to contain the animals securely.
Correct by: This incident was reported by the IACUC and corrective measures have been taken.
This routine inspection was conducted on June 29 2015 and June 30 2015. An exit interview was conducted with
facility representatives and APHIS personnel, Dr. Simone Tomlinson and Dr. Natalie Cooper on June 30, 2015.
