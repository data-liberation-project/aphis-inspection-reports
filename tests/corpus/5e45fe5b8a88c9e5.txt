3.11(b)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The dog room is too dirty. Five dogs have free access to the basement room. The room has a concrete floor and
cinderblock walls. Dried mud, dirt, and hair is accumulated across the floors and walls, especially along the seems
where the floor meets the walls and in corners. A couch, chair and ottoman in the room provide bedding which are
heavily soiled. A drain from the adjoining utility room seeps water which the dogs cannot avoid when coming in and
out. Accumulated dirt and moisture may harbor disease agents which pose a health risk to the dogs. Primary
enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent accumulations of dirt, debris, waste,
and other disease hazards. Surfaces which cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized shall be removed or
replaced when worn or soiled.
