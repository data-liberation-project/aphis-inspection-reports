FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Pens E12 and E13 have a drainage problem with mud and standing water around the shelter, watering, and feeding
area. Even though these pens are not used on a regular basis they need to be maintained in a condition that allows
animals to be kept in them when needed. Mud and standing water is a potential breeding area for vectors and if
animals cannot get to dry ground can result in hoof problems. There needs to be away to drain off water so mud
does not accumulate in these pens.
