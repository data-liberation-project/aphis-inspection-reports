Sanitation.
There was an excessive amount of clutter and construction debris found in many areas throughout the facility. Unused old
flooring, scrap metal, and miscellaneous piles of debris was observed, with some piles stored adjacent to and on top of
animal enclosures. Clutter and debris can serve as a breeding ground for pests and vermin. Pests can spread diseases
and can potentially have a negative impact on the health of the animals. The facility must correct this issue.
