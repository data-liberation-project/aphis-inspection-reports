2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are no written records annotating where animals on the facility were acquired from. A primate was sold within
the last week but no receipt of information of the sale could be produced. Without adequate records keeping, there
is no way to properly track animals acquisition or disposition. Create a written inventory of animals with all pertinent
information required.
3.75(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The refrigerator currently being used for non human primate food continues to be soiled with bits of food waste on
the walls and shelves. There are green vegetables in the fridge that are soiled and rotting, and pinky mice in the
freezer that are not going to be used. There is a risk of contamination if food is not properly stored in a clean
environment. Sanitize the animal food storage area and ensure that no other items are stored on or around them.
3.78(b) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
An enclosure housing 2 adult macaques has only one small wooden shelter which is not large enough to house
both animals at the same time without possible discomfort to the animals. There is a risk of health and safety by not
providing animals with shelter from the elements. Adequate shelter for all animals in outdoor enclosures must be
provided. Provide enough shelter to adequately house all animals in the above mentioned enclosure.
3.84(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*A Piece of hard metal wire was noted on the floor of the macaques enclosure.
*Multiple items of trash such as construction material, metal bowls, and unused tools were seen inside the perimeter
fence around primary enclosures.Trash or chemicals, if accidently ingested by the animals could cause serious life threatening illness. Unused tools
or construction items could potentially pose a health or safety hazard and can house pests. Premises, including
housing facilities and primary enclosures must be kept free of trash and discarded materials to meet acceptable
housekeeping standards and protect the animals from injury.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*On the north end of the facility there is 1 area between the lemur enclosures and the perimeter fence that is not at
least 3 feet apart, making it hazardous to walk between.
The perimeter fence must be kept in good repair and kept closed to prevent unwanted animals and persons from
gaining access to the facility, and to function as a secondary containment system in case of animal escape. Visual
and physical access of the fence must be maintained so that the fence can be inspected for structural integrity and
repairs. Ensure perimeter fence is at least three feet away from all primary enclosures in order for it to be safely
inspected.
