3.80(a)(2)(9) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Surfaces inside the enclosures for non-human primates should be maintained so that they can be readily cleaned
and sanitized, and should be replaced or repaired when worn or soiled.
The following problems were observed at the time of inspection:
A.) Lemurs - A wall in the outside enclosure has an area with exposed construction paper material and peeling
stucco-like material.
B.) Squirrel Monkeys - Extensive areas of missing and peeling paint from ceiling, metal perches, walls, and
grating. Although the enclosure was repainted within the past year, the paint job was not durable.
C.) Chimpanzees - Paint missing and peeling from metal grating that comprises the walls of the outdoor enclosure,
as well as paint peeling from the metal frames that hold the grating, and frame the doorways in the outside
enclosure. There is also evidence of some rust in these areas.
Non-human primates that are exposed to surfaces that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected due to
deterioration, or that are exposed to debris from peeling paint or decomposing surfaces, could suffer ill effects to
their health and well-being. Surfaces should be maintained in good repair, free of debris, and such that they can be
adequately cleaned and disinfected.

3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The animal enclosures should be structurally sound, and maintained in good repair, so as to protect the animals
from harm. The following hazards were observed in animal enclosures: A.) In bats there was an electrical cord on the floor of the enclosure. Although the keeper stated that the bats do
not choose to go onto the floor, this possibility cannot be ruled out, and electrical wires inside an enclosure present
an electrocution risk.
B.) In the elephant barn there was a broken plastic sky light, and another skylight was cracked. There was no
screening or netting to prevent broken pieces from falling into the enclosure. Sharp plastic pieces could cause
injury.
C.) Sections of the elk / bison chain-link fencing were damaged, with dislodged and bent support poles, and
sagging chain-link. The fence does not appear to be structurally sound, and also poses a risk for entanglement.
D.) In the zebra enclosure a temporary divider had been constructed in order to prevent access to one half of the
enclosure. The divider was made from metal stakes, plastic snow fencing, and piles of cut logs and branches. The
divider showed evidence of having been breached by the animals, and poses a risk of entanglement or injury from
the sharp metal stakes.
E.) In the Eland enclosure there was chicken-wire on the top that had become dislodged along one edge, and had
sharp metal ends that could cause injuries to eyes or skin, were the animal to access it.
Enclosures should be maintained in good repair, and free from hazards that could cause injury. Items A, D, and E
to be corrected by 1/15/16, item B to be corrected by 2/8/16, and item C to be corrected by 5/1/16.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Whereas some significant improvements have been made to the perimeter fence, and new fencing has been, or is
in the process of being installed, in several places inspected the perimeter fence still does not meet the
requirements specified in 3.127 (d). The fence should be at least eight feet in height, due to the presence of
animals defined as dangerous animals, and it should prevent animals from passing under or through the fence, as
well as providing secondary containment in the event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure. The following
shortfalls were noted:
A.) There are portions of the fence that fall short of the eight feet minimum height requirement. For example near
the camels, where the original fencing comprises part of the perimeter fence, sections measured were 71"(cid:29), 74"(cid:29),
80"(cid:29), and 90"(cid:29) in height.
B.) Near the camels there are some gaps under existing gates that could allow animals to pass under the gates.The gate referred to as the (cid:28)"Bison Gate"(cid:29) has a six inch gap underneath, and the gates around the camels have six
and seven inch gaps.
C.) Where the new fencing is being constructed there are several gates that are not yet functional or installed,
leaving large openings in the perimeter fence-line.
These observations are examples of where the perimeter fence does not meet the standards specified. The fence
should consistently meet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. This facility should have a
perimeter fence which adequately prevents people and animals from passing through or under the fence, and which
can also act as a secondary containment system for the animals on exhibit. This facility houses animals such as big
cats, bears, hyenas, and elephants, and therefore the perimeter fence should be at least eight feet in height, and it
should either fully enclose the whole premises, or the areas where these animals are housed, with a perimeter
fence measuring at least six feet in height for the other animals. There should be a separation of at least three feet
between the animals on exhibit and the perimeter fence, and it should preclude contact with people or animals. The
fence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described here. Failure to
meet these standards could endanger the health and well-being of the animals in the facility.
