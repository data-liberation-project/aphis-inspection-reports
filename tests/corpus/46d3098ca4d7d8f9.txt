INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
This facility does not have a stable functioning IACUC committee and has not had one for years. The longest the
committee has maintained a stable group of members has been about a year. Since the IACUC meeting in Oct
2015 three new members have been appointed. One of those new members has agreed to act as Chair.

This is concerning for multiple reasons. The training involved to effectively function on an IACUC committee not
only involves formal IACUC course work but actual time attending and participating in meetings. This facility has 1
meeting every six months. It is impossible for this committee to function effectively with (cid:28)experienced(cid:29) members
leaving after 2 meeting and new (cid:28)non-experienced members(cid:29) trying to successfully continue the program.

Another problem identified by a consultant hired by the university to review the vet tech program and apparent
during USDA inspections is a lack of communication within the department and within the IACUC. This was evident
at the Oct 2015 IACUC meeting. An offsite facility was inspected without the knowledge of the full committee. All
members must be informed of all IACUC activities in sufficient time to participate if they choose.

As a result of this lack of communication there seems to be confusion on job descriptions within the department and
on the committee. During this inspection no one was able to tell me who was responsible for maintaining the
IACUC meeting minutes and facility reviews required during USDA inspections.

A stable functioning IACUC committee needs to be established with trained, qualified members who have a clear
understanding of their roles within the committee.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In the past this facility has found it necessary to employ 2 trained veterinary technicians to assist with surgeryclasses for the vet tech students. They currently have 1 trained veterinary technician. The activities that required 2
technicians to be available at the same time will have to be adjusted so that they can be safely performed by one
technician or another technician needs to be hired prior to those activities beginning.
The facility is responsible for ensuring there are enough appropriately trained employees to provide adequate
veterinary care to the animals.
