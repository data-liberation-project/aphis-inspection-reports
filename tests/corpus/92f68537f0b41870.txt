2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
On 11/3/21 a long-time volunteer with the Kirshner Wildlife Sanctuary took a snow leopard that was born 5/31/21 to a
juvenile detention facility, where the volunteer is employed, for an educational exhibit. While at this event, two of the
volunteer’s adult coworkers at the detention facility were photographed holding the snow leopard. This five month old
potentially dangerous animal was too large and too mature to be safely handled by members of the public.

During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public,
with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of
animals and the public.

The facility should ensure the well-being of the animals and the public by not allowing members of the public to handle
potentially dangerous animals.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility President.
