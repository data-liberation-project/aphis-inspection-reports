FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The axillary gate for the kangaroo and springbok outdoor exhibit area has a nonfunctional locking mechanism which
is currently held together by a rusty wire. The locking mechanism for this gate must be repaired to prevent the
potential for escape for all the animals housed in this enclosure. Also the rear wall of the wooden shelter inside this
same outdoor enclosure has a large hole (approximately 3 feet high and 4 feet wide) where the springbok could
potentially become injured. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by: November 1, 2017.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Approximately 30 feet of zoo perimeter fence along White Sands Boulevard was damaged by a vehicular
impact. A minimum of ten feet of concrete block was broken and has been removed. Several of the decorative
metal rail sections of the fence were broken or bent in this area as well. A welded wire panel has been temporarily
placed in the perimeter fence gap. At the time of the inspection, it was also noted that there was a minimum of four
fence posts to the north of this damaged section of perimeter fence that were extremely rusted. In the area where
these four decorative metal fence posts attach to the concrete block, much of the metal was rusted away entirely.
A second 30 foot section of the zoo perimeter fence near the public parking lot has been damaged by vehicular
impact since the July 2016 inspection. A minimum of ten feet of concrete block was broken and removed. Several
of the decorative metal rail sections of the fence were broken or bent in this area as well. A welded wire panel has
been temporarily placed in the perimeter fence gap.

The structural integrity of this section of the zoo perimeter fence along White Sands Boulevard has been
compromised to the point where it can no longer function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
zoo. The perimeter fence must be constructed and maintained so that it protects animals in the facility.
3.131(d)
SANITATION. In the zoo veterinary hospital, there was rodent fecal material on the floor around the perimeter of the exam room.
Rodents can be a potential source of disease transmission to the bobcat and fox housed in the veterinary hospital.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained. To be corrected by: November 1, 2017.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative.
