Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility does not have a written environmental enrichment plan for nonhuman primates, despite having an
approximately 2-month-old male ring-tailed lemur.
Nonhuman primates have complex social and environmental needs. Nonhuman primates who are not provided with an
appropriate environment and social interactions may develop abnormal behaviors, may experience high stress, and may
become unhealthy or obese. Infant nonhuman primates, as well as primates housed alone, require special attention to
provide for their needs and to combat stress. Correct by 6/1/22 by documenting an enrichment plan in consultation with
the attending veterinarian to addresses at minimum enrichment of the environment, provision of social interactions, and
special considerations for infants and primates housed alone.

Facilities, outdoor.
3 red kangaroos are contained in a large enclosure with 8-foot-tall chain link fence. The perimeter fence around the
kangaroo enclosure is made of wire farm fencing and is approximately 4.5 feet tall. A perimeter fence must be strong and
tall enough to prevent entry of unauthorized people and animals, and to act as a secondary containment system in the
event that an animal escapes from its primary enclosure. Correct by maintaining a perimeter fence around the kangaroo


enclosure that is at least 6 feet tall and 3 feet away from the animals primary enclosure, or by obtaining a variance from
USDA. A perimeter fence must also be maintained around any existing or new exotic animal enclosures in accordance
with the Animal Welfare Act regulations.
