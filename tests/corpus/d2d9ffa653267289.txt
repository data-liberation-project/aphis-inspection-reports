FEEDING.
At least 20 self-feeders are rusty or are pitted on sides and/or lids especially the buck enclosures. Self-feeders with
significant rust or otherwise pitted (especially around the feed hopper area) may cause abrasions to animals while
eating. Additionally, rust makes cleaning and sanitization more difficult. Improperly sanitized surfaces can harbor
disease. Food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. The rusty and/or pitted
self-feeders must be repaired or replaced so that the feeders can be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Correct by
March 1, 2016.
