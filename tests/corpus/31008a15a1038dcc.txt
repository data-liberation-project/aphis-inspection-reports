3.1(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
**In Kennel "L" housing a total of 81 juvenile to adult, male and female beagles, runs #32 and #53 have broken, plastic
doors separating the indoor and outdoor sides of the runs. The entire side of one of these panels is cracked apart,
creating an opening with sharp edges through which the dogs can squeeze. The plastic was replaced immediately by
facility representatives when noticed during the inspection.
**On the west side of Kennel "L" 22/30 of the runs have areas on the floors where the epoxy paint has worn or chipped
away, leaving unsealed and/or chipped concrete visible; on the east side, 19/30 of the runs also exhibit unsealed and/or
chipped concrete. The damaged areas range in size from ~1 inch in to over 3 feet by 1 foot in size.
Cracked or broken surfaces can entrap or injure animals. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be properly
cleaned and sanitized, creating the potential for harboring microorganisms that can pose a disease risk for the dogs.
Absorption of water via cracks or other unsealed areas can also undermine the structural integrity of surfaces, causing
them to fail and potentially injure an animal. Surfaces of housing facilities must be free of jagged edges or sharp points
and constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee
must ensure that animals are not kept where surfaces have sharp edges or where surfaces are not sealed in a manner
that makes them impervious to moisture. All surfaces must be appropriately maintained at all times in order to support the


health and well-being of the animals.
