3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, the following animal had recently arrived at the KLM cargo office on flight 605 via
Amsterdam originating in the Ukraine:
A four month old dog on waybill number 074-77673164.
The dog did not have a shipper's certification regarding the last time food and water had been offered, and what
feeding and watering instructions were to be during transport, attached to the crate.
At the time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment the carrier must ensure that the consignor provides certification in
writing regarding feeding and watering instructions, and the last time food and water was offered. Failure to provide
this information could put the animal at risk. This information should be clearly displayed on the carrier, during
transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order to help ensure that
animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
3.14(a)(6) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At the time of inspection, the following animal had recently arrived at the KLM cargo office on flight 605 via
Amsterdam originating in the Ukraine:
A four month old dog on waybill number 074-77673164.
The crate did not have the words "LIVE ANIMALS" on the top or sides in letters at least one inch in height, as
required. There were also no arrows to denote the upright position of the crate during transport.
Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it should be clearly marked on top and on one or
more sides with the words ``LIVE ANIMALS", in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and with arrows or other
markings to indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure, in order to help ensure proper handling bytransportation personnel.
Failure to properly label crates used to ship live animals could result in mishandling by transport personnel, which
could be injurious to the animals.
3.16(c) REPEAT
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
At the time of inspection, the following animal had recently arrived at the KLM cargo office on flight 605 via
Amsterdam originating in the Ukraine:
A four month old dog on waybill number 074-77673164.
The crate contained only one receptacle that could hold food or water.
Food and water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the
receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosure without opening the door. Failure to provide a food and a water
receptacle could result in inadequate feeding and/or watering, which could be detrimental to the animal.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with cargo personnel at the KLM cargo office.
