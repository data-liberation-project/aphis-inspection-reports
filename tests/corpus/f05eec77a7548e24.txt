2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***On the inventory records, there was a female adult Common Marmoset listed as being acquired on 7/23/16 and
died on 8/2/16. According to the licensee, upon acceptance, this Marmoset was not walking in a normal manner.
The hind end was moving in a waddling sort of manner. The licensee was told by the previous owner that a
Macaque had "gotten ahold of her." The date or time of this occurrence was unknown by the licensee. The licensee
also stated that the previous owner stated that this was a metabolic bone disease, yet no veterinary paperwork was
acquired at the time of acquisition of the Marmoset. A licensed veterinarian was not contacted for evaluation or
treatment of this animal during 7/23/16 and 8/2/16. Lack of veterinary care for appropriate diagnosis and treatment
plan can worsen the current condition, delay healing or result in death. The licensee must assure that all regulated
animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.
To be corrected from today September 22, 2016, forward.
This inspection began at 1054.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
