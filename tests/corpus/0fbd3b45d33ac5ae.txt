WATERING.
The drinking and/or swimming water in several enclosures was green from an overgrowth of algae. Green water is
not considered potable water. Water that has been left long enough to have an overgrowth of algae could also have
an overgrowth of bacteria and mosquito larvae. Potable water must be provided in sufficient quantities and as often
as necessary to ensure the health and well-being of the primates. Water receptacles must be checked and cleaned
more frequently.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The Patas Monkey and Lemur enclosures did not appear to have been cleaned in some time. There was a large
accumulation of old fecal material and other debris. Primary enclosures must be spot cleaned daily to remove fecal
material and food waste and disinfected at least once every 2 weeks to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and
odors.
