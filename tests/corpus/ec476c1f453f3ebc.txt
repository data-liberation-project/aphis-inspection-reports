2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female Yorkshire terrier with chip number 103348556 has a small amount of creamy discharge in the canal
of her left ear. There is some moist as well as dried discharge in the fur under the ear. The skin around the opening
of the ear canal and along the rear edge of the pinnae is thick and dark in color. This may indicate an infection or
parasites associated with this ear and may cause discomfort to this dog. This dog must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian in order to ensure an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed
and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment, and resolution of the condition must be
documented and made available to the inspection upon request.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
