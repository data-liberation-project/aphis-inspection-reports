3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an excessive buildup of feces in 9 of the outdoor runs, as well as on the floor inside 7 of the primary
enclosures.While the licensee is sanitizing once per week, there has not been consistent daily pick-up of the
primary enclosures or runs. The fecal pick-up has been on every other day, or on this date it has been 2 days
before cleaning. This lack of daily cleaning has caused the feces to cover all of the flooring inside and out and on
the fencing where the dogs jump, as well as a considerable amount of feces on the dogs feet and legs.
The lack of daily pick-up and buildup of feces in the enclosures and runs can be a source of disease and possible
health issues for the regulated animals.
The licensee must spot clean daily, or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt, grime and feces that
comes in contact with the regulated animals.
