HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The primary enclosures for the sloth and the brown lemur do not have adequate barriers to prevent physical contact
with the public. All animals should be exhibited in a manner that minimizes the risk of harm to the animals or the
public. There is not adequate staff present to monitor public interaction with the animals. Adequate barriers are
necessary for all unsupervised exhibition in order to safeguard the animals and the public. Steps should be taken
immediately to ensure that public contact with animals does not occur.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some surfaces in the housing for non-human primates is in need of maintenance and / or repair. Specifically the
metal perches in the night-house for the capuchin monkeys had peeling paint, and also in the inside of the
enclosure the center post has paint peeled off of about fifty percent of its surface. The outdoor play yard for the
spider monkeys has loose paint peeling off in sections that are accessible to the monkeys. The surfaces should be
maintained in good repair in order to protect the monkeys from the risk of ingesting paint chips, and so as to
facilitate adequate cleaning and disinfecting.
Temporary measures should be taken immediately to reduce exposure to peeling paint, with surfaces to be repaired
more substantially by 7/22/15.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The shelter for the goats has corrugated metal edges that are bent out and sharp, posing the risk of injuring the
animals. All animal housing should be maintained in good repair so that it is safe and structurally sound.

SANITATION.
The back service area, where the commissary is located and where there is housing for off-exhibit animals, has a
large number of discarded items and other clutter and debris accumulated around the building grounds. Behind the
primate enclosures there was a discarded rusty door. Such items should be removed or properly stored, and the
grounds maintained so that they do not provide habitat for vermin.
To be corrected by 3/22/15.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
