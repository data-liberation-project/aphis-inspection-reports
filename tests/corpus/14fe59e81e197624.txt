FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Field 1 at location 91, containing 8 ovine, had a shelter with a gap under the wall in the back right corner where it
appeared to have a missing or rotted boards. The gap was sufficiently large to present a risk for entrapment of the
animals and allow weather conditions such as wind or precipitation to enter the shelter causing the animals
discomfort.
In field 23 at the main location, containing 46 caprine, the top portion of a tree had fallen on top of the back
fence. The tree rested on the ground inside the field and created a climbing structure which might be appealing to
the goats. If the goats climbed the tree it could lead to injury or escape.
These two items must be corrected to assure that the animals are adequately protected from the weather and do
do not injure themselves or escape. Correct By: 10 November 2014

SANITATION.
Field 10 on top of the hill at the cow palace location, containing 20 bovine, had an agricultural drag that had been in
the pasture long enough to have been partially covered by the turf. Several parts protruded high enough that they
could cause injury to the animals and two parts had hoof marks that appeared to be the result of animals tripping on
the protruding metal. A gate was laying on the ground in this pasture as well and could also cause injury from
tripping.
The field beside building D, containing 8 ovine, had a gate and had been down long enough to have been
partially covered by the turf. There was a chain link portion of the gate that could ensnare small hooves, and a sheet
metal portion that presented a slippery surface on which the animals could lose footing and fall.
These items must be removed to assure that they do not cause injury to the animals. Correct by: 10 November
