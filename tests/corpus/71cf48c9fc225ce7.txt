2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has an attending veterinarian (AV) and a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC); however, the PVC
is not complete as it does not include the sheep at the facility.
A complete PVC is required to ensure the facility has written guidance from the AV for all species in the areas of
vaccinations, parasite control, emergency care, euthanasia, and additional topics if needed, to maintain the health
and well being of the animals.
The written PVC should be updated to include the current inventory of animals.
