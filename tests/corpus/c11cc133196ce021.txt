3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The following housekeeping issues were noted in the swine housing building at the time of the inspection:
** There was an accumulation of dark, dried fecal material coating a large portion of the walls of the pens. Although the
Licensee removes solid and liquid excreta from the floor of the pens several times per day, the presence of the excreta on
the other surfaces inside the pens contributes to odors.
**There was a thick layer of dark colored particulate material coating the surfaces of the overhead metal support frame of
the barn’s roof, the surfaces of the overhead lights, and the surfaces of equipment kept inside the barn. In addition, large-
sized cobwebs were present on the walls in the corners of several of the pens. This build-up of dust and debris indicates
infrequent cleaning and could affect the health of the animals.
** The indoor swine pens are made from polycarbonate panels attached to metal vertical posts. The upper horizontal
edge of a couple of polycarbonate gates were noted to be cracked or have broken jagged edges. The damaged edges of
the gate panels could cause an injury to the animals’ snouts or limbs.

Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to protect the
health of the animals, and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.



The Licensee needs to clean the surfaces inside the barn and also increase the frequency of cleaning to minimize build-
up of the debris that coats the surfaces and to maintain the cleanliness of the enclosures. In addition, the Licensee needs
to repair or replace the polycarbonate gate panels for the safety of the animals and to ensure that the housing facilities
are maintained in good repair. Correct by 12/17/21.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 11/17/21 with the Licensee.
