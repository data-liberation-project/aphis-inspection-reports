Handling of animals.
On August 23, 2021, a 10-week-old red fox bit a child during exhibition. During public exhibition, animals must be handled
so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal
and the general public to assure the safety of the animals and the public.
