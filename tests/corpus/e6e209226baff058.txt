Housing facilities, general.
*Inside the whelp building, numerous items are being stored on the tops of the wire enclosures that move as the dogs
move about. The numerous items include medications, cleaning supplies, bolts, syringes, needles, collars and other
items. These items are all covered with dust and some cobwebs, indicating they are not frequently used. Liquids can
spill and smaller objects could fall into the enclosures, leading to potential injury or illness to the dogs. Animal areas
inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter.

3.1(c)

Housing facilities, general.
*In the whelping facility and adult dog kennel the wash down under the enclosures has an accumulation of a heavy brown
grime and moldy feed covering over 75% of the plastic wash down. Animal waste collecting under dogs’ enclosures
creates an unsanitary condition and could lead to potential disease or health risks for the dog. The potential for increased
insect and pest infestation exists when animal waste is not removed in a timely manner but allowed to build up under the
dogs. Removal of animal waste from under the runs in a timely manner before building up occurs is necessary to ensure
the health & wellbeing of all dogs.
At least four enclosures had an accumulation of hair, cobwebs and dust trapped in the wire structure of the enclosures.

The affected areas are in the whelping building and adult building. Hair, cobwebs, and dust was accumulating along the
sides, tops and fronts of the enclosures affecting 4 adults and 3 puppies. The accumulation of hair, cobwebs and dust
create an unsanitary living condition that could impact the health and well-being of the dogs. It indicates a potential living
area for other pests that are housed with the dogs. The licensee must remove all hair, cobwebs, and dust from the
affected areas so these surfaces can be cleaned and sanitized to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices.

3.9(b)

Feeding
*Three of the self-feeders used in the whelping kennel and two of the feeders used in the adult dog building are dirty,
have an accumulation of grime, and one has mold on the outside of the feeder. Food receptacles that are not adequately
cleaned and sanitized could increase the risk of contamination and molding of the food and affect the health and well-
being of the dogs by creating breeding environments for pests and bacterial growth. The licensee must establish and
maintain a program to ensure that all food receptacles are cleaned and sanitized for the health and well-being of the dogs.
