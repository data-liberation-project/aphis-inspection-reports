ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The rabbit on the 4th row in cage number # 4 from the rear of the facility has a bloody crusted appearance on her
nostrils. The nares look eroded and inflammed. There should be daily observation of all animals to assess their
health and well-being. There should also be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication conveyed to the
attending veterinarian with timely and accurate information on the problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being. Correct from this day forward.
The exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
