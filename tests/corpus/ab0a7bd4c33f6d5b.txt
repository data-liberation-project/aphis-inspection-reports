INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
During the inspection a male prairie vole was found singly housed. Protocol 2014-05 states that animals will be
group housed, and there are no provisions for singly housing animals. When questioned, the Primary Investigator
stated that animals are housed singly as needed in order to make the best possible use of available animals.
Prairie voles are noted as being a highly social species, and according to the protocol are intended to be housed
socially. The protocol must be amended to provide justification for singly housed animals, and describe any
necessary steps which will be taken to ensure that any singly housed animals are being managed appropriately.
To be corrected from this point forward.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
