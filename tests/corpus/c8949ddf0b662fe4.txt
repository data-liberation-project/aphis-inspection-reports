3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor building for the gibbon needs to be addressed. The walls inside the enclosure have flaking paint and are
no longer sealed which does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization. Additionally, there is a metal support
beam in the enclosure that is rusted with rust flaking off the beam. These surfaces must be maintained on a regular
basis to facilitate cleaning for the gibbon.
3.81(c)(4)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The agile gibbon "Beanie" is individually housed without being able to see any of the other nonhuman primates on
the premise. A review of the facility's environmental enrichment plan did not address the special considerations of a
singly housed nonhuman primate. It's important to provide special attention to singly housed nonhuman primates to
alleviate potential stress in the absence of social contact. Contact your attending veterinarian in order for them to
provide written instructions regarding the care of singly housed nonhuman primates.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The enclosures that house the alpacas and the llamas, zebu, and goats have several large accumulations of feces
that need to be removed. These areas need to be cleaned as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and
prevent contamination to the animals.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
An empty enclosure within the alpaca pasture has an open gate which allows access to a broken metal waterer,
broken concrete blocks, and sharp metal fencing. There is also a roll of chain link fence intended to divide the
pasture that is laying on the ground with several sharp protruding wires. Additionally, there is an approximately 1foot by 1.5 foot hole in the chain link fence which divides the enclosure that has several sharp protruding wires. This
could be a safety hazard if the alpacas were to walk on or near the exposed sharp points. The outdoor enclosure
should be kept clean and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
