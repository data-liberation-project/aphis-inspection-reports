3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Two enclosures had a live unprotected electrical cord that was accessible to the animals. The live cords were powering
the Asian small-clawed otters' pool and the hybrid cats' water fountain in each of their respective enclosures. Electrical
cords pose a significant health risk to animals that may chew or pull on them. Unprotected powered electrical cords that
are within an animal's enclosure allows access to an electrical hazard that can cause electrocution, injury and/or death.
Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect animals from injury including limiting access to electrical
cords. Corrected at time of inspection.

This is a 2nd Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
