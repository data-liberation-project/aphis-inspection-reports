2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual reports to the Institutional Official must, by regulation, be reviewed and signed by a majority of the
IACUC members. The reports on file for this facility show that only the IACUC chair has been signing them. In
order to assure that the IACUC functions as intended and required, all future semi-annual reports to the IO must be
signed by at least 2 IACUC members, which represents a majority of the currently constituted committee. This
number must be adjusted if the committee increases in size.
An exit interview was conducted with the registrant.
