Housing facilities, general.
Collar handles in the animal rooms, used to move animals, were covered in wads of dirty soft fabric like material
(presumably vetwrap). The material was unsanitary, and may harbor dirt and bacteria that are disease hazards. The
facility must ensure that all surfaces, (including objects), inside the facility can be readily cleaned and sanitized or
replaced when worn or soiled.

Housing facilities, general.
The produce refrigerator had a partially dried puddle of a yellow-orange substance on the floor, with a bag of carrots and
cardboard box of fruit stuck to it. Spilled fluids may grow bacteria and molds and contaminate feed, presenting a health
hazard to the animals. The facility must ensure that food storage is sanitary and prevents contamination.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
A hole of approximately 3 inches in diameter (ie, 1/2 the size of a brick), next to a pipe running through the room, was
noted in the wall of room 120, with dark debris inside. Dirt and other materials in the hole may harbor bacteria or molds


that are detrimental to animal welfare, and the location of the hole may provide ingress or refuge for vermin. The facility
must ensure that premises are kept clean and in good repair to protect the nonhuman primates and facilitate husbandry
practices.
