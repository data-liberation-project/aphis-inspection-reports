HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an accumulation of junk ,discarded items and tall weeds/grass in the dogs outside yard. Inside rooms used
for the dogs are littered with trash and items not needed in the daily care of the animals . A bottle of drain cleaner
was found on the floor in the front room. The tall weeds and discarded items outside create a perfect environment
for snakes and pests which may harm the dogs . The trash and bottles of cleaners on the floor in the front room do
not provide for a healthy,safe area for the dogs . All junk, discarded items,tall weeds/grass and toxic items must be
removed from the outside and inside housing areas. These areas must be maintained free from these items to
provide proper husbandry practices. CORRECT BY : 6-6-15

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The tile on the floor of the front room has peeled up from the floor in many areas. The underlying wood is not
impervious to moisture. There are 2 large holes in the sheet rock on the wall next to the kitchen . Surfaces must be
constructed so they are able to be readily santized. The exposed wood on the floor and holes in the sheet rock do
not allow for proper cleaning. Floors and walls that the animals come in contact with must be impervious to
moisture.CORRECT BY : 6/6/16

additional dogs each need at least 1.7 feet of space. Dogs do have access to a large indoor and outdoor area but
are maintained in wire enclosures when the owner is away from home. Dogs must be housed in enclosures that
provide at least minimum space. CORRECT BY : 5-7-15
