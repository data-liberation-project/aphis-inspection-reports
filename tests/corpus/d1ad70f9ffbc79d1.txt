FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Tiger enclosure, (cid:28)Alaya(cid:29): The enclosure(cid:25)s top chain-link fencing had areas of separation creating a gap between
two top support poles and between the joint of the top and one side of this chain link enclosure. At least one bolt
from a steel tension band has broken loose creating this opening. This gap may be large enough to allow an
unauthorized animal to enter the enclosure and/or may lead to continued separation if not repaired.
-Extension cage for tiger, (cid:28)Alaya(cid:29): This enclosure has an opening approximately 4 inches wide and 8 inches long at
the top of the enclosure. The chain link fencing is not securely fastened to the support pole creating this gap. This
gap may be large enough to allow an unauthorized animal to enter the enclosure and/or may lead to continued
separation if not repaired.
All enclosures must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to securely contain the animals. A system of facility maintenance and repair
must be in place.
