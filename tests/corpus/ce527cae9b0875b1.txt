ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1410 on
08-Aug-17. I went to the licensee's house. The licensee answered the door, but the person that is authorized to do
the inspections was not available. I informed her I would try back another time.
End of report.
