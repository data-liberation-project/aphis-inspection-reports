ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has not contacted the veterinarian regarding two juvenile goats that are sick. The first goat (ear tag
#0021 and white in color) appears thin and was observed frequently squinting. Additionally, this animal has green
crusty material around both eyes. The second goat (ear tag #0020 and black in color) also appears thin and was
observed frequently squinting. This animal also has green crusty material around both eyes. Finally, this goat also
has large clumps of dried feces all around the anus and stuck to the fur under the tail. The facility indicated that
they have been treating these goats, but their conditions have not improved. All issues of animal health must be
reported to the veterinarian to assure that they receive care according to the veterinary professional standards.
The veterinarian must be contacted regarding these health issues. All instructions and/or prescribed treatments
must be followed.
To be corrected: by 5:00 pm on 8-29-14

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. Several exposed nail heads and points remain on the outdoor shelter for the pigs. The shelter is located just
outside of the barn that houses twenty four pigs. The sharp nail points and heads could potentially injure
themselves.
Assure that all indoor and outdoor housing facilities are maintainted in good repair.
2. Three goats were observed moving from their enclosure into another enclosure housing two sick goats during
the time of inspection. One goat slipped through a small opening in between the panel fencing dividing the two
enclosures. Another goat passed through the openings of a gate that divided the two enclosures. Contact with the
sick goats could cause the healthy goats to become ill. Assure that all animal enclosures contain the animals within them.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Unused wood and building materials are present along the northwest wall of the barn. These items are adjacent to
the enclosure housing all of the goats, sheep, and alpacas. These materials are also accessible to the three calves
housed in an open, adjacent stall. The animals could potentially injure themselves on/with these items.
Assure that unused wood and building materials are not accessible to animals and are not stored inside of animal
enclosures.
Note: The exit interview was conducted with the facility owner.
