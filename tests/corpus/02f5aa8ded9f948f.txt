ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care the licensee provided at the time of inspection is not complete. Licensee
does not have adequate guidance from the attending veterinarian to provide preventative care or treatment for
routine and common veterinary problems. In order to ensure problems of animal health are addressed adequately,
a written program of veterinary care should include what common health problems they may have and how these
will be addressed by the licensee and the Attending Veterinarian.
The formal arrangement with the Attending Veterinarian shall include a detailed written program of veterinarian
care.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The acquisition record for animals being utilized in regulated activities is not correct. During time of inspection
licensee stated she was utilizing one brown/white hedgehog named "Cactus" but the acquisition record (records of
animal on hand) listed one albino hedgehog named "Salt". Maintaining current records of animals, including those
acquired and disposed of, is required in order to be able to accurately track animals being utilized in regulated
activities.
Make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding the
acquisition and disposition of animals.
