SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
1. Many of the pens inside the barn were noted to be in need of cleaning. There was an accumulation of dark,
dried fecal material coating most of each wall of the pens as well as on the surfaces of the hutches and rubber mats
that were inside the individual pens. Although solid and liquid excreta are removed from the floor of the pens daily
by the Licensee, the presence of the excreta on the other surfaces inside the pens contributes to odors and the
soiling of the animals. In addition, a few of the primary enclosures had large-sized cobwebs present on the walls in
the corners of the pens.
Per this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures should be cleaned and excreta shall be removed as often as
necessary to prevent the contamination of the animals, to minimize disease hazards, and to reduce odors.
Cleaning of the enclosures is important to keep the animal premises clean and to provide for the health and
well-being of the animals.
The Licensee needs to thoroughly clean all of the surfaces within the primary enclosures inside the barn and should
perform the cleaning on a more frequent schedule to minimize build-up and to maintain the cleanliness of the
enclosures.
Correct by 5/30/16.
NOTE - Exit interview held on-site 5/19/16 with Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 5/23/16.
