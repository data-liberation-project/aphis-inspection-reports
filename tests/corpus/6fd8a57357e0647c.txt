- The following medication was past the labeled expiration date: panacur (cid:19) Feb. 2014. This medication was
intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. Expired
drugs may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could harm the animals. Medications must be
labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents of the container can be known
with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that medications are not used past their expiration dates.
The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled properly in accordance
with standard veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.
Corrected during the inspection.
