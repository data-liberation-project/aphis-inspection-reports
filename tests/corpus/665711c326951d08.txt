2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The seven mink and four striped skunks documented on the last inspection report for needing veterinary care were
euthanized by the licensee before discussing them with the new Attending Veterinarian (AV) and without seeking any
veterinary care for their injuries / illnesses. The licensee stated that he had sought guidance from a non-veterinary source
who advised him that it was better to euthanize the animals that were documented by the USDA rather than discussing
them with the new AV, and possibly overwhelming him. All dealers and exhibitors must ensure that the Attending
Veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and oversee the adequacy of
other aspects of animal care and use. Choosing to euthanize animals in need of veterinary care that were identified by
APHIS Officials rather than communicating those issues to the Attending Veterinarian, prevents the AV from having the
opportunity to provide guidance for their care, fully assessing the housing and husbandry at the facility, and therefore
prevents them from ensuring the adequacy of both veterinary care and other aspects of animal care. Correct by ensuring
that the Attending Veterinarian has authority to ensure the provision of adequate care and further by ensuring that any
additional animals identified by APHIS Officials are appropriately examined by a veterinarian to ensure appropriate
methods are employed to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease. Correct by: October 14, 2022.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At least 7 animals were identified during the inspection that required veterinary care. These animals were not identified by
the licensee prior to inspection.

One brown adult male alpaca was observed by inspectors to have creamy discharge present at the base of the right ear.
The licensee restrained the animal for inspectors to get a closer examination. Upon further examination there was dried
dark brown exudate at the base of the ear and cream-colored discharge that was coming from a 2 cm circular mass at the
base of the ear. When light pressure was applied to this mass a large amount of thick cream-colored discharge was
expressed. Discharge coming from the ears of an animal can indicate an abscess or ear infection. Abscesses are known
to be particularly painful before they are opened and leaving them without treatment can lead to unnecessary pain and
suffering.

One arctic fox was observed by inspectors to have excessively long nails. The nails were long enough that when the
animal was standing the nails extended through the wire floor approximately ¼ of an inch. Excessively long toenails can
cause difficulty walking and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures, causing injury.

Five skunk were observed with excessively long toenails. The nails were long enough that they extended through the wire
flooring of the enclosures while walking. Excessively long toenails can cause difficulty walking and can be caught in wire-
bottom enclosures and cause injury.

Failure to adequately observe animals daily, and/or failure to communicate issues of abnormal animal health and behavior
to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner, is not adequate veterinary care. Without adequate veterinary care, an


animal’s condition may worsen, and if infectious, can spread to other individuals. Correct by ensuring that the animals and
conditions listed above are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animals can be properly examined,
diagnosed, and treated. Additionally, ensure that daily observation of animals is adequate to identify all signs of abnormal
health and behavior. Ensure that there is accurate and timely communication of problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

Watering.
Approximately 30% of the animals on the property were found to be thirsty during inspection because their water
containers were dry. Several additional animals had water contaminated with feces. The inspection process began at
approximately 12 pm eastern time. The licensee stated he had last watered the animals the prior evening around 7 pm.
The licensee stated that since the last inspection he has begun watering twice daily, but that he had not yet finished
watering that morning. At the start of the inspection, water receptacles in the front of the facility appeared to have water,
but the majority receptacles in the back of the property and mink barn were dry. The licensee provided water to these
animals throughout the inspection. Approximately 105 mink, 36 ferrets, 8 striped skunks, 14 Arctic fox, 20 red fox, and 1
raccoon all drank immediately when provided with water. Several animals were observed drinking voraciously including
at least 3 red fox that drank for over two minutes and two mink which were observed drinking to the point of spitting up
water only to begin drinking again immediately. The eagerness and length of time spent consuming water when offered
indicates that the animals are extremely thirsty, and that the current schedule for watering is not sufficient to meet the
animals’ basic needs. The facility must provide water as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
