3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The inside/outside kennel building enclosures are not being adequately cleaned. The licensee stated that she has
not cleaned thoroughly in a few days. There is an accumulation of feces under the outside run portions of the
enclosures and more than a days’ worth of feces accumulated inside the runs. Some of the indoor areas of the
enclosures have a grimy buildup on the floors and areas of dirt and/or feces stuck on the walls. There are also
blankets used for bedding that have become urine soaked and contribute to a strong odor inside the building.
Accumulations of excreta, grime and wet bedding within the animal enclosures creates an unhealthy environment
and can cause health problems for the dogs. Ensure all waste material and soiled bedding is removed from the
primary enclosures daily, as required, to prevent soiling of dogs and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and
odors. Correct by November 8, 2018
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
