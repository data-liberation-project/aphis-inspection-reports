veterinarian and treated per their recommendations.

diets. These serious non-compliances are signs of suffering in these animals. To alleviate animal suffering;
treatment plans directed by a licensed veterinarian must be initiated before 1pm on Monday October 3, 2016.

FEEDING.
APHIS officials observed no fewer than 12 carnivores at the facility exhibiting signs of poor body condition indicative
of a lack of food of a sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good: "Kody" (male Kodiak
grizzly bear); "Benny" (male Syrian bear); "Kiwani" (female Syrian bear); "Lilly" (female black bear);"Grunt" (maleblack bear); "Holly" (female black bear); "Raphael" (male white tiger); "Shula" (female Bengal tiger); "Hercules"
(male African lion); "Asia" (female Bengal tiger); "Leonardo" (male African lion); and "Macey" (female wolf hybrid).
The licensee represented to APHIS officials that he typically feeds these animals every-other-day, and Saturday
(October 1, 2016) is a scheduled feed day for the animals. The licensee has approximately 500 pounds of chicken
leg quarters and other miscellaneous meat products on hand to feed the animals, and stated additional food
supplies (chicken) would not be available for pick-up until Monday. The facility’s feeding protocol (dated January
2013), however, states the facility requires over 800 pounds of meat per feeding for the animals. The facilities’
feeding plan does not consider the animals’ current poor body condition, and the facility does not have adequate
food supplies on hand to meet the facility’s minimal food needs (as described in the January 2013 plan).
APHIS officials observed no fewer than two additional animals exhibiting signs of poor body condition indicative of a
lack of food of a sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good: "Gertrude" (Female hog
-housed at the barn) and "Marshmallow" (Female sheep - housed at the barn Insufficient). Inadequate quality or
inappropriate diets can cause serious illness in animals leading to health problems in the animals to include death
by starvation.
The regulations provide that: “The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient
quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet shall be prepared with consideration for
the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. Animals shall be fed at least once a day except as dictated
by hibernation, veterinary treatment, normal fasts, or other professionally accepted practices.”
The diets for the above mentioned animals must be assessed with consideration for the age, species, condition,
size, and type of the animals. The facility must demonstrate it is able to provide food to the animals of sufficient
quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. To be corrected by 1pm on Monday, October 3,
2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the sanctuary director and a volunteer.
