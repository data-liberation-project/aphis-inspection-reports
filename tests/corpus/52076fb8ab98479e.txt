FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The young red fox pups were exhibited in sturdily constructed metal enclosures that included a removable metal
wire grate floor above a solid bottom tray. The young pups were small enough that in at least two incidences one
hind limb was noted completely dropping through an opening in the grate past the level of the knee/stifle. When one
of the pups tried to lift its rear leg out of the grate the grate was lifted up over an inch from level with the pup's leg.
Another pup's front paw was noted falling through one of the openings of the grate. Enclosure floors must be
constructed in a manner that protects the pups feet and legs from injury. This was corrected during the inspection
by removal of the grates from the enclosures.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
This inspection was conducted at the Espresso Exotic Animal Expo in Cowan, TN.
