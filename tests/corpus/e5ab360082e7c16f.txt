underlying medical condition. Lameness can be the result of an injury or underlying medical condition.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on July 18, 2014, to obtain accurate
diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be
provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic
tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with
the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the
medication is administered to the dogs.

that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the need
for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
