ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30am on
06/23/2016. During that time, the inspector knocked on the doors of both houses on the property. The inspector also
called the contact number and left a voicemail for the licensee.
Lack of availability for inspection prevents any oversight by APHIS Officials in enforcement of the Animal Welfare
Act.
Correct by establishing optimal hours for inspection with the home inspector, and ensuring that a responsible adult
is
available during those times for inspection. Correct from this time forward.
