ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1655 on
14-Sep-16.
I called and left a message and returned my about 10 minutes later. He is out of town today. He also had moved
about two weeks ago. He will contact the office with his new address.
