2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The records for animals on premise are incomplete. The acquisition records indicate the date of acquisition and the
number of animals acquired but contain no other information.

Records for animals purchased or otherwise acquired must fully and correctly disclose all of the information required by
this section, including the name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired, the USDA license
number of that person (if applicable), the date of acquisition, the species of animals acquired, and the number of animals
in the shipment.

To be corrected from this point forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
