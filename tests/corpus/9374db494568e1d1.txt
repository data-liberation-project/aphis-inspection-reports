Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
This was a focused inspection dealing with a predator attack (three mountain lions) resulting in the death of two
reindeer.
The perimeter fence has been raised from 10' to 14' and brush cleared back 10' all around the perimeter fence. The
reindeer are now being housed inside the barn at night. The barn has been fortified with additional stock panels
and fencing to make the barn secure and prevent outside enter, if the predators return. Security cameras and
motion detecting lighting has also been installed and updated.
Wildlife services and Oregon fish and wildlife have been contacted and this resulted in the killing of at least one of
the mountain lions. It is believed they have moved out of the area and no longer a threat at the present time.
