Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The following two dogs in two outdoor enclosures were found to have loose stool and had not been identified by the
licensee. Neither dog had been evaluated by a veterinarian and is not under treatment for the loose stool. Both
enclosures contained rodent poison pellets on the ground next to the self-feeders.

A Bernese Mountain Dog (microchip #990-000001972407) and a Golden Retriever (microchip #941_000018993114) had
loose stool coating the hair beneath each dog’s tail. There were several loose stools found in each of the dog’s
enclosures.

Loose stool could indicate an underlying health issue and if left untreated could result in severe illness and even the death
of the animal. The above-mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to
develop an effective treatment plan.
3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
There were at least 3 outdoor enclosures housing a total of 11 adult dogs that contained rodent poison pellets within the
dog shelters. The licensee states they placed poison below the self-feeders to help control the rodent problem identified

on a previous inspection report. The rodents or dogs have pulled the pellets out from under the self-feeder and are now in
direct contact with the dogs. At the time of the inspection, the licensee removed most of the rodent poison from the
affected enclosures.

In one enclosure where rodent poison was present, the licensee and inspector observed one adult dog carrying around a
dead mouse in its mouth. The licensee took the dead mouse away from the dog and discarded it away from the dog
enclosure at the time of the inspection.

Dogs that ingest rodent poison or ingest a rodent that died from poisoning, may become severely ill or possibly result in
the death of the dog. Housing facilities must protect the animals from injury. The licensee must ensure the dogs do not
have access to rodent poison or rodents that have died from the poison. The licensee must ensure that the housing
conditions are safe for the dogs at all times
3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
At least 6 outdoor enclosures have a buildup of brown organic material coating either the interior surfaces or exterior
surfaces of the self-feeders. The buildup is thick enough that the inspector used her fingernail to scrape the material off
the feeders. An approximate total of 19 adult dogs have access to these affected food receptacles. The licensee stated
that they power washed the feeders with cold water in the last 2 weeks, but no disinfectant/detergent product was used. A
buildup of organic material within the self-feeders could increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dog.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and
more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. Hard

surfaces must be sanitized using one of the following methods: live steam under pressure or washing with hot water (at
least 180° F) and soap or detergent. The licensee must clean and sanitize the self-feeders and ensure that all aspects of
the enclosure are maintained in a clean and sanitized condition in order to support the health of the dogs.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
