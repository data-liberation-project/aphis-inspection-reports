3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The enclosures in the cattery need to be cleaned more often. There is scattered litter, hair and food on the floor in
many of them, and in one there is a pile of feces in the corner. There is a buildup of grime at the base of some
dividers and on some of the floors in the enclosures. The licensee was cleaning the enclosures when the
inspectors arrived, and some of the enclosures had already been cleaned. The licensee stated that she had
recently returned from vacation, and the person she had taking care of the cats while she was gone had made sure
the litter pans were clean. However it is obvious the cleaning that was done was not sufficient to protect the cats
from disease hazards.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned daily to prevent an excessive accumulation of excreta and food waste to keep
from soiling the cats and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures be cleaned at least daily and sanitized at least once every two
weeks or more often if necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
To be corrected from this day forward.
3.12
EMPLOYEES.
The facility was observed to have an accumulation of hair, litter and other debris throughout the cattery. The person
that was helping every day with cleaning and husbandry practices no longer works there. From the conditions of
the cattery during the inspection it is obvious the licensee is falling behind and is unable to keep the cattery up to
the proper husbandry standards by herself.
Each person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations must have enough employees to carry out the level of
husbandry practices and care required in this subpart.The licensee must acquire employee(s) to help with cleaning, maintenance and husbandry practices to maintain the
health and well-being of the animals in the facility.
To be corrected by August 12, 2015
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with Dee Heezen, VMO, and Lynn Clarke, ACI with facility
representative.
