Sanitation.
The wire and plastic walls of two different rabbit enclosures contained excessive urine scale. Addtionally, the facility room
walls behind and on the sides of both enclosures also contained excessive urine scale. Both enclosures contained two
male rabbits. In the first enclosure, urine scale lined the back solid plastic wall all the way up to the wire. In the second
enclosure, comprised of wire walls on the floor, urine scale was abundant on the wires and on the facility wall for the
majority length of the enclosure. Excessive urine scale can harbor diseases and produce odors.
Thoroughly clean the rabbit enclosures and repeat often enough to prevent urine scale build up.

Facilities, general.
There were multiple animal enclosures in disrepair during the time of inspection.
1. The fencing is in disrepair in the enclosure housing a single pig. The fence is comprised of wood posts and 2x4 inch
wire. Multiple areas of the 2x4 wire are damaged and no longer attached to the posts. Additionally, the loose wires have
bent inward, exposing them to the animal. Finally, the fence, adjacent to the shelter, has a thin piece of laminate
floorboard covering an area that does not have 2x4 wire. A small portion of the laminate board is missing and appears to
have animal bite/chew marks.

Exposed wires could potentially injure the animal and the laminate floorboard isn’t structurally sound and could allow the
animal to escape.
Ensure animals are housed in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair.

2. The fencing is in disrepair in the enclosure housing two pigs. The fence is comprised of wood posts and 2x4 inch wire.
At least 1/4 of the wire fence is damaged and unattached on the bottom. The resulting loose wires are bent inward and
upward, exposing them to the animals. Additionally, two wood pallets are present directly outside of the fence to prevent
the pigs from escaping. Exposed wires could potentially injure the animals.
Ensure animals are housed in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair.

3. The roof and ground of the enclosure housing the red fox and Artic fox are in disrepair. The roof of the enclosure is
comprised of 4ft x 8ft plywood. Two sections of the plywood have bent and cracked downward into the enclosure. The
licensee stated the weight from the winter snow caused the damage. The current condition of the roof is a safety hazard
to the animals as it could collapse and injure them.
A portion of the enclosure floor/ground is covered in 12in x 12in concrete pavers. Two different areas of pavers have
partially collapsed into holes dug by the foxes. The larger hole was approximately 1ft x 2ft in diameter. The holes
combined with the collapsing pavers are a safety hazard as the animals could be injured.
Additionally, the holes have unearthed a portion of buried chicken wire used to prevent the animals digging out of the
enclosure. The animals could potentially dig underneath the exposed chicken wire and escape from the enclosure.
Ensure animals are housed in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair.

4. In the enclosure housing the coati and two skunks, a section of partially unattached wire is exposed to the animals.
The wire, located near the top of the enclosure and approximately 2 feet in width, has been used to patch the enclosure
fencing. The wire is bent inward and accessible to the animals and could potentially injure them.
Ensure animals are housed in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair.

5. Five windowpanes are broken and missing glass in the room housing four Patagonian cavies. The broken
windowpanes are not accessible to the animals but have large enough openings to allow for wild animals to gain entry.
One of the broken windowpanes had a piece of laminate floorboard placed over it and the licensee placed an addtional
piece of laminate floorboard over another during the time of inspection. The latter piece of laminate floorboard is not
securely attached to anything and could be easily pushed in.
Ensure animals are housed in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair.

Facilities, outdoor.
Two areas of the perimeter fence are incomplete. The licensee has erected additional animal enclosures and increased
the size of the perimeter fence since the last inspection. The perimeter fence has two gaps, each approximately 3 1/3
feet wide by 6 feet tall, where the gates will be installed as per the licensee. At the time of inspection. Two animal
enclosures (the first containing one Artic fox and one red fox) (the second containing two raccoons and one coati) are
contained within the incomplete perimeter fence. The Perimeter fence acts as a secondary containment area and inhibits

unauthorized persons and wild animals from coming into contact with the facility animals.

Assure the perimeter fence is completed and maintained in good repair.

Note: This was corrected between the time of inspection and the exit interview.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
Excessive flies were present in the enclosure housing two pigs. The flies were seen all over the enclosure but were
concentrated on the ceiling. The licensee had multiple fly strips hanging up from previous year, but the strips were full of
flies and no longer functional. Flies can carry and spread disease.

Implement and maintain an effective program to control the flies at the facility.
