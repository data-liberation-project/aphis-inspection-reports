FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is a strong smell of ammonia in the building housing the skunks, kinkajou,prairie dogs and opossums.The
ammomia level was high enough to cause my eyes and throat to burn upon entering the building. Owner's husband
stated the odor was due to the mice housed in the building. Ammonia at a level that causes irritation to a human's
eyes and nasal passages can be expected to cause similar irritation and discomfort to the animals. There is a
portable AC unit in the building but there is no additonal ventilation or fresh air.This room must be properly
ventilated and the source of the ammonia ( dirty rodent cages ) corrected to minimize odors and provide for the
health of the animals. CORRECT BY : IMMEDIATELY

SANITATION.
The floor of enclosure housing the 2 praire dogs is littered with dirty wet bedding . The sheet covering the floor of
the kinkajou enclosure is covered with feces and old food .Dirty bedding and old food are an attractant for flies and
pest and a source of diseases. Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals and to minimize disease hazards. CORRECT BY : 8-19-16
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted by Dr. Pannill - USDA with the owner's husband.
