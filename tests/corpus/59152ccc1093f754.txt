Facilities, general.


There are approximately five goats in an enclosure that has a rusted metal back wall panel with deteriorated holes varying
in size and a rusted bottom exposing sharp edges which the animals have direct contact with. In the same enclosure
there is a sheet of wood measuring approximately 12 x 16 inches, drooping down on one side with with an exposed nail
head, directly above the enclosure. There is a pen with three adult goats where there is an approximate 3-4 inch vertical,
and 5-6 inch horizontal, break in the bottom of the fence near their shelter, with protruding sharp pointed edges. The
entire length of the back of the enclosure housing 3 sheep has a break in the fence, near their shelter, which exposes
sharp and rusted points of the fence. The back enclosure housing approximately 4 goats has a fence that is somewhat
loose and rolling inward at the bottom all around the enclosure, where it is worse both in the front and rear of the
enclosure.

Enclosures that are not kept in good repair can lead to the escape, injury and/or death of the animals, as well as entry of
outside animals. Repairs to all of the enclosures must be made to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the animals housed
within them. Correct by June 5th.

on a muddy ground without a receptacle. The mud is a potential source of contamination for the hay. Food that is not
prevented from contamination could lead to illness and distress. Any food provided to the animals shall be free from
contamination. Correct by June 2.
