Sanitation.
The upper left enclosure housing 8 adult guinea pigs and 4 offspring had accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding
covering most of the the floor. Ineffective cleaning or not cleaning often enough can expose the guinea pigs to disease
hazards and health problems. Enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta, soiled
bedding, and wet bedding and enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring all primary
enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent and accumulation of excreta, soiled bedding, and wet
bedding. Correct by August 14, 2021.
