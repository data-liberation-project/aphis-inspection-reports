2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility representative could not locate APHIS form 7005: Record of Acquisition and Dogs on Hand during the
inspection. This form is required so that there is a record of adult dogs at the facility with their identification and age
information as well as a record of who sold the dogs to the licensee. The licensee must complete and maintain form
7005 for all adult dogs on the premises.
To be corrected by March 25, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
