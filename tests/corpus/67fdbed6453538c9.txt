FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One six month old lion escaped from his primary enclosure on April 15, 2015. Five lions were on exhibit in the play
yard, including two adult lions and 3 juveniles (approximately each 6 months old). The door from the outdoor lion
exhibit to the keeper area vestibule was accidentally left open by a keeper allowing the animal to escape. This entry
into the lion enclosure has two doors with a double containment type set-up. The inner door of the enclosure
(primary enclosure to vestibule) consists of a heavy metal mesh swing-type door while the outer door (vestibule to
keeper office area) is a heavy metal solid swing type door. The keeper later stated to APHIS Officials that he was
distracted by a volunteer he was escorting and by a radio call and must have forgotten to properly secure the lion
enclosure. He stated that when he looked later, the inner door was left wide open and that he was aware that the
outer door does not automatically close. Hence both doors were left open. After the keeper left the immediate area,
one of the six-month old lions left the primary enclosure gaining entry to a keeper area (not open to the public) that
contains a desk, the kitchen / food prep area, a bathroom, and a stair way to an upstairs office area. Shortly
afterwards the same keeper saw the juvenile lion entering the bathroom shower area and was able to shut the
animal in by closing the door thereby containing it in the bathroom while notifying other staff and properly securing
the other animals. This animal was able to be guided back to the primary enclosure without injury to either the
animal or any handlers and no other animals escaped the primary enclosure.
Primary enclosures for all animals must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect animals from
injury and contain all animals. Failure to properly secure the enclosure places the keepers and animals at risk of
injury in the event of an escape. Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are constructed in a manner to contain all
animals and are maintained in a manner to facilitate containment (including properly shutting and locking all doors).
In response to this incident the facility immediately notified APHIS Officials. Additionally, the facility instituted a
two-person verification for shifting all animals and a checklist for proper containment near the animal holding area.
The facility also reports that they have ordered a new heavier door for the vestibule that has a automatic closure
and which they believe will reduce the risk of accidental incomplete closure in the future.
Correct by: From this point forward This was a focused inspection to examine the lion enclosure. The inspection was conducted on May 6th 2015 with
the Attending Veterinarian, Associate Veterinarian, and Curator. Exit interview was conducted with the Curator by
phone.
