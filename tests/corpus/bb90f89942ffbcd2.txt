INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Section 2.31(e)(3) IACUC: The methods and procedures section of Proposal 171 does not include a description of
the animal groups and the number of animals per group. The number of days the animals receive injections also is
not included. A proposal must include a complete description of the proposed use of animals to ensure procedures
minimize pain and distress to the animals, to provide the IACUC sufficient information for protocol review, and to
comply with the animal welfare regulations. Correct by March 24, 2015.
