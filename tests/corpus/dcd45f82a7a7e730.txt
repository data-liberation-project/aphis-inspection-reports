SANITATION.
-The linoleum or vinyl tile floor covering in the kitchen had portions of the surface missing and had exposed wooden
subflooring impeding good sanitization of this area. The premises (buildings and grounds) of exhibitors shall be
kept clean and in good repair in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
Original correction date of 07/31/15
-The enrichment refrigerator near the kitchen had a buildup of grime and food debris coating the shelves on the
inside of the door. Additionally, surface water from rain had pooled by the exterior steps leading into the kitchen
and would hinder the normal ingress and egress to the kitchen.
