2.31(d)(1)(xi) CRITICAL REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
This inspection was a focused inspection to verify correction of items previously documented as non-compliant
during the previous USDA inspection on April 11 2017. The facility has not yet corrected deficiencies previously
cited under 2.31 (d)(1)(xi) for euthanasia of guinea pigs with carbon dioxide gas. This is a repeat critical
non-compliance.
The method of euthanasia for guinea pigs in the facility utilizes tanked carbon dioxide gas delivered to a euthanasia
chamber. The chamber is a galvanized tub covered with a clear acrylic plastic lid. A pressure reducing regulator is
connected to the gas tank and is used to control gas pressure from the tank to the gas supply line going to the tub
enclosure. No flow meter or other monitoring device is present in the system to monitor gas flow rates into the
chamber. A facility manager stated the outflow pressure of gas from the tank is set at 30 psi at the regulator. The
facility written euthanasia procedure states “turn on the CO2 at 20 to 50 pounds PSI until no further animal
movement is observed.”
The described facility procedure for euthanasia of guinea pigs with carbon dioxide gas does not meet current
standards set forth in the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition. The procedure in use by
the facility lacks a flow meter to accurately maintain and monitor consistent gas flow rates to the chamber during the
euthanasia process. The use of a tank regulator pre-set at a specific psi is not sufficient of itself to ensure that an
accurate flow rate of carbon dioxide gas is being consistently delivered to the euthanasia chamber and
recommended gas displacement rates are being achieved. Without an appropriate sized flow meter in place,
chamber gas displacement rates may be too high or too low. This may then lead to significant pain and distress to
guinea pigs during the euthanasia process.
AVMA guidelines for carbon dioxide gas usage recommend a chamber displacement rate of 10-30% of chamber
volume/minute. This displacement rate has been found to produce less pain and distress during the onset of
unconsciousness than other rates.
Overall, methods of euthanasia used must be in accordance with AVMA species guidelines and in accordance with
9 CFR part 1, unless a deviation has been previously justified in writing and approved by the IACUC.A flow meter and appropriate methodology shall be employed to ensure that accurate carbon dioxide gas flow rates
and chamber displacement rates are consistently maintained and monitored by facility personnel during the
euthanasia process. In conjunction, animals need to be visually monitored by personnel throughout the euthanasia
process and SOPs updated with required flow meter settings. Retraining of all employees who perform euthanasia
shall also be done and documented.

Regarding deficiencies previously cited on last inspection under 2.33 (b)(2), the facility has corrected the
deficiencies, Contact information for the attending veterinarian and provision of emergency, weekend and holiday
veterinary care have also been posted within the animal facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Manager of Regulatory Affairs, Director of Regulatory
Affairs, QC- Microbiology Supervisor and the QC - Microbiology Manager.
