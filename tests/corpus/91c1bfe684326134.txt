ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following animals are in need of attention:
*One unshorn white female sheep has a distinct limp to her walk. She appears to be favoring her hindquarters/rear
leg. She was noted being able to walk across part of the pasture during the inspection. Limping is a sign of pain
related to a veterinary health issue. This sheep needs to be examined by a veterinarian to ensure that a diagnosis
for the limp and a treatment plan are instituted. Correct by Mar. 12, 2017.

*Both alpacas are in need of hoof trimming. The white alpaca has very long hooves on all four feet that are curling
under and outwards. The black and white alpaca's hooves are also starting to show signs of curling. Overly long
hooves can lead to stresses on the joints of the leg and pain to the animals. The alpacas hooves need to be
trimmed. Correct by Mar. 31, 2017.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The three ringtail lemurs have been moved to a different enclosure while some construction is ongoing. The new
enclosure does not have any enrichment present other than one small shelf on which the food receptacle is placed.
There are no climbing structures, no swinging structures and no perches as described in the facility's written
enrichment plan. The facility shall ensure that the written enrichment plan is followed and that the lemurs are offered
environmental enrichment in their primary enclosure. Correct by Mar. 12, 2017.

WATERING.
The water bottle for the ringtail lemurs was noted lying on the ground outside of the enclosure and was completelydry. The bottle was filled with water and rehung during the inspection. All three lemurs immediately took turns over
the next 5-6 minutes drinking water. The bottle is held in place by just one single thin wire. The facility needs to
ensure that the lemurs have sufficient quantity of water available to drink to ensure their health and well-being.
Corrected during the inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility currently houses two prairie dogs. The acquisition records state that six prairie dogs were purchased in
fall 2016. The owner reports that four of the prairie dogs escaped from their cages at the facility and were not
recaptured. Animals raised in captivity most likely are not able to fend for themselves in the wild. The facility shall
ensure that all enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animals. Correct from
this day forward.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The feed/medication storage room needs cleaning. The non-functioning refrigerated used to store medication is
covered in brown black dirt inside and out. Old and unlabeled bottles need to be thrown away. The shelves of the
room are covered in a thick layer of dirt, dust, cobwebs and rodent pellets. Old bottles and other materials stored on
the shelves are covered with dust, dirt and cobwebs. Open cardboard boxes of rotting peppers and other produce
that according to owner are waiting to be thrown out are propped on the covered bins containing feed. Feed buckets
prepared for the days feeding are partially uncovered. Dirt, dust, cobwebs and trash/waste will attract pests and
may lead to contamination and deterioration of the foods and medications stored in the room. All contents and
surfaces of the room need to be cleaned with all trash/waste to be properly disposed of. Correct by April 15, 2017.
