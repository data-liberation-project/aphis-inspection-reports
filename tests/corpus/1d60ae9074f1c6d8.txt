At the facility's main treatment room medicine cabinet, a large bottle containing prescribed medications was
identified with expired dates on its label. All medications intended to be used as therapy for regulated animals
should have current expiration dates to provide the best possible care. All expired medications and medical
products intended for use with regulated animals should be properly discarded.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A permanent primary enclosure for the Virginia opossum was not available at the time of inspection; an owl was
occupying the already approved outdoor housing enclosure for the opossum. The opossum is temporarily been
housed indoors in the clinic area of the main building. The intended outdoor and/or indoor housing facilities for
regulated animals shall be available for inspection to ensure these are structurally sound and be maintained in good
repair, and in that way, regulated animals are protected from injury and are properly contained. The facility needs to
provide a permanent primary enclosure to the resident opossum and make it available for inspection.

WATERING.
At the time of inspection, drinking water for the opossum at its temporary enclosure was not available. The facility's
potable water must be accessible to the animals at all times; if potable water is not available, it must be provided in
clean/sanitary receptacles as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.
