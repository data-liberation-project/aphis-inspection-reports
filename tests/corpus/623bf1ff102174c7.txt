ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Yorkshire terrier (tag #159) has excessively long toenails. The toenails on the front feet have become so
long they have developed a severe curve to their shape. Overgrown toenails could cause pain and discomfort to
the dog as well as affect the dog's natural gait.
The licensee must trim this dog's toenails to a proper length. The licensee must develop and maintain a plan for
toenail maintenance that will ensure that the toenails of all dogs are kept at an appropriate length at all times.
3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In at least two enclosures, containing a total of two adult dogs and two puppies, the metal feeders have become
excessively rusty. The majority of the rust is located along the front edge of the food cup and along the inside of the
food cup. Excessive rust does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the surface and could also cause the
metal to break resulting in sharp points and edges.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be free from excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and
sanitization or which could affect the structural strength of the surface. The licensee must replace the rusty feeders
or alter them in a manner that eliminates the rust. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities
are free of excessive rust at all times.

replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace the damaged carpets, plastic bowl, wood, and plastic
access door or alter them in a manner that allows for these surfaces to be adequately cleaned and sanitized.
