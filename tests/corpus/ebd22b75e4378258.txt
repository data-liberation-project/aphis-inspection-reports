Feeding.
One of the rabbits housed in the barn had a feed receptacle with dried urine spots and dirt caked on the exterior of the
feeder, which the licensee stated had not been cleaned since the animal was received several months earlier. Lack of
sanitation of feeders may result in deterioration of the feed and nutritional content. The licensee must ensure feeders are
sanitized at least every two weeks.

Watering.
The water bottle for the coatimundi had pale to dark green material adhered to the sides and top of the bottle. Similarly,
one chinchilla had green material adhered to the interior of the water bottle. Growth of algae and biofilm may contaminate
water and present a disease hazard. Water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

Sanitation.
The animal access door from the interior of the coatimundi enclosure to the exterior pen was caked with feces and dirt
although the enclosure had just been cleaned. The sugar glider enclosure similarly had old fecal pellets present caught in


the cage wire although it had been cleaned the day before. Failure to remove animal wastes including excreta may lead to
contamination and presents a disease hazard. The licensee must ensure that animal excreta is adequately removed
during cleaning.
