3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
About 45 enclosures (most which housed weanlings) had excessive buildup of dry fecal pellets on the far end. The
licensee said it has been 2-3 weeks since these enclosures were cleaned out. Also, about 25 enclosures had areas that
were excessively wet and soiled under and around the drinker valve and drainage grate. Primary enclosures must be
cleaned and sanitized at least every 2 weeks but more often if soiled to prevent buildups of waste. More frequent
cleaning is important to prevent harmful waste buildups that can be bad for guinea pig health. Ensure that cleaning and
sanitizing of each enclosure is completed at least every 2 weeks or more often to prevent buildups of waste and soiled
material.
