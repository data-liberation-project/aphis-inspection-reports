3.13(b)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Medical records were not complete for one dog at the facility. “Chief”, a one year old female Siberian Husky (microchip
#956000014227699), has been seen by the attending veterinarian for a condition of her left eye. While the inspector was
able to confirm with the veterinarian a recheck exam was performed, there are no medical records documenting the
examination or veterinary findings to determine the state of the dog’s eye and next steps moving forward.
Complete records identify medical problems as they arise, ensure adequate care is provided, and enables close
monitoring of conditions as they progress. Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make them
available during inspection. If a problem is identified (such as a disease, injury, or illness) the date and a description of the
problem, examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedure performed must be
included in these medical records.
