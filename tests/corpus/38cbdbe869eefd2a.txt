ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Yorkshire terrier (m/c# 044 598 799) had wet hair around both eyes and was squinting both eyes. Upon
closer inspection, there was a small amount of gray discharge in both eyes and both corneas had a dull
appearance. The licensee had not noticed the condition. Eye problems can progress rapidly, can be painful, and
can result in loss of vision. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian and must produce
documentation of diagnosis and treatment upon request by the inspector.
TO BE CORRECTED BY OCTOBER 6, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
