Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult male Boston Terrier (#0003), “Alec”, was observed squinting his left eye which also had a heavy amount of
discharge surrounding it. Upon closer observation, the eye itself was difficult to visualize and the dog would close his eye
harder and frequently turn his head away while trying to get a closer look. After a brief glimpse of the eye, it appeared to
be cloudy and reddish blue in color. The fur surrounding the eyelids and within the skin fold down the left side of the nose
was wetted down from eye drainage. The drainage appeared mostly clear with some small yellow-like crusts noted
around the eye. The dog’s right eye also had a slight clear discharge noted. After the licensee talked by phone to the
other owner it was discovered that the dog’s eye condition had been identified during an early morning check by the other
owner but he left the facility prior to addressing the dog and letting the other owner know about it. The licensee mentioned
a plan to use an eye medication for treating the dog’s eye which is instructed in the facility’s Program of Veterinary.
However, at the time of inspection which was around 2pm, the dog had not yet been treated and the medication could not
be located at the facility. This dog’s eye condition appears to be painful and could be due to an injury, infection or other
veterinary medical condition which could worsen with time. The licensee must ensure that if a treatment plan has been
established by a veterinarian which addresses the animal’s condition, then the treatment plan must be followed and in a


timely manner. The licensee must ensure that appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries at all times. To be corrected by: October 7, 2020

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
