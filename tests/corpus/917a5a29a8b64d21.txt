2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
*** In the Equine Therio Barn there was a bottle of Penicillin G that expired in February 2014 and a bottle of
Phenylbutazone that expired March 19, 2014. The use of medications that are past the expiration date printed on
the label may not be safe or efficacious and is not considered to be an acceptable practice. The facility needs to
review their current procedures for monitoring drugs and medical supplies to ensure that all medications to be used
on research animals are not out-dated. Correct from this day forward.
The exit briefing was conducted with the Interim University Veterinarian.
