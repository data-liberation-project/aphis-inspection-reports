SANITATION.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that the stream bed that runs through the calf, goat and sheep enclosures
was in need of attention. This water feature is ~ 6-8(cid:29) deep. However, the water in this stream bed was brown and
emitted an odor. At this time you could not see the bottom of this stream bed. To ensure that the areas are kept
clean this water feature will need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis.
