2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On Saturday, 9/24/22, the wagon driver, who is employed by the facility, had taken a wagon load of guests out on the
safari veld at noon. Around 12:20 p.m., he had stopped for a feeding station with the animals. When he finished with the
feeding, after checking between the tractor and wagon for clearance and everyone taking a seat, he slowly took off. He
felt a bump and then realized a larger heifer bumped a young watusi calf under the rear tire wheel on the wagon. The
Director of Animal Operations arrived shortly afterwards, and found the young watusi calf deceased, appearing to have
died upon impact. The event was self-reported by the facility.
Due to the nature of the drive-through park, vehicles without protective tire shields like fenders or other structures have
the potential to injure the free-roaming animals.
The facility must take corrective actions to prevent recurrence of such unanticipated events with the facility vehicles,
including wagons, that may cause harm to the animals.
