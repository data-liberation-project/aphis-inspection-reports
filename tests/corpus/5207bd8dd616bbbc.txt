FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is standing water and mud in the west outdoor portion of the bear enclosure. There is an accumulation of
mud at the egress door to the sheltered portion of this enclosure. The bear was observed to go from the sheltered
portion to this outdoor portion and purposefully avoided the mud by stretching out onto a log and concrete footing.
Standing water and mud may increase disease transmission and make it difficult for the animal to enter and exit the
shelter. A suitable method must be established to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by 8 June 2015.
