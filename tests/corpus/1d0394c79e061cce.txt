2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** This was a focused inspection to ensure the animals cited in the previous inspection report (conducted 6 June
2016) were examined and diagnosed by a veterinarian and treated appropriately. The animals were: "Jasper" an
adult, male Egyptian Mau cat (#27); a 5-week-old female Egyptian Mau; an 8-week-old male Egyptian Mau; and a
litter of five 10-day-old Russian Blue kittens.
The licensee could not get an appointment with her regular veterinarian by the correction deadline (without an
emergency visit) so she took the cat and two kittens to a veterinary clinic she had never visited before. The
veterinarian stated that a proper diagnosis would require examinations and cultures. He stated he could provide
those services for a fair fee but he recommended that the licensee's usual veterinarian examine the cats and
diagnose the problem since this was a chronic problem in the cattery and he was familiar with the facility history.
This veterinarian never examined the animals, never provided a diagnosis or treatment plan, and never charged the
licensee.
The licensee stated that later in the week she took the cat and two kittens to her regular veterinarian. According to
the licensee, the attending veterinarian diagnosed the kittens with chlamydia and recommended treating with
terramycin (twice a day) and amoxicillin (once a day) for ten days. According to the licensee, the veterinarian stated
Jasper's wound was consistent with a cat fight and should be treated daily with Triple Antibiotic Ointment. The
licensee had no documentation from the veterinarian about these diagnoses or treatment plans. There were no
discharge instructions or even a bill. The licensee keeps individual treatment records for each cat and kitten at the
facility but was unable to provide the inspector with any records showing these animals were being treated. The
licensee stated she had been providing the treatments for three days but was unable to show the amoxicillin being
used to treat the animals. She stated she had just ran out of amoxicillin that morning. She stated she needed to
order more but it would likely be several days before she received it. According to the licensee, the vet clinic does
not carry amoxicillin so it has to be special ordered. The inspector called the attending veterinary clinic and was told
amoxicillin does not need to be special ordered. Furthermore, the veterinary clinic could not confirm that the three
animals had been seen within the past week.
Although the cat and kittens appear to have improved, the problem may not fully resolve if the treatment plan isn'tfollowed to completion. Furthermore, failing to administer the entire antibiotic regimen as prescribed (i.e. skipping
daily doses) may result in highly resistant bacteria in the kittens, making future bacterial infections very difficult to
treat.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive proper veterinary care at all times. This includes ensuring that all
medical care is properly documented and all treatment plans are followed as prescribed.
The inspection and an exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
