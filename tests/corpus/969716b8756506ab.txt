Housekeeping for premises.
During inspection, two rooms had enclosures positioned so that non-human primates had been able to reach
objects that were not intended for animal contact. In EB3348, a radio had been pulled off the shelf and at least one
of the two cynomologous monkeys in the enclosure had been playing with the power cord. In W2442 an enclosure
with three cynomologous monkeys was close enough to a plastic feed storage tote that at least one of the monkeys
was found to have been chewing on the plastic liner bag. Enclosures placed so that animals can gain access to
stored items in rooms could have adverse effects on animals.
Correction: The enclosure racks were moved immediately by staff during inspection so that the animals could no
longer access stored items. To protect the safety and health of animals, the facility must ensure that animals do not
have access to stored items in the rooms.
Inspection of animals and animal facilities was conducted on 6/27/2016 and records review and exit interview was
conducted on 6/28/2016 with facility representatives.
