2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee is offering animal feed to the visiting public. There are large enough gaps in the sheep and goat
enclosure fences where the animals can place their heads through these openings. There is the potential that the
public can hand feed these animals and an attendant is not available at all times of this direct public contact.
Insufficient attendant supervision of animals during times of public contact can leave animals at risk for improper
handling and feeding of items by the public other than what is provided for the animals. Sufficient number of
responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employees or attendants must be present at all times during
periods of public contact. Correct by 12 July 2014.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are broken welds in the welded-wire fence for the enclosure housing one rabbit. This is resulting in a gap
and wire points. These may cause injury to the rabbit. All enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury. Correct by 26 June 2014.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are numerous places where the established perimeter fence is inadequate. There are gaps of several inches
between the lower section of the fence and the ground, there are sections of fence that consists of metal pipe fence
with large gaps present, and there is one metal pipe gate that is not 6 feet in height. Inadequate perimeter fence
may not restrict animals and unauthorized people from entering the facility. The perimeter fence must be at least 6
feet in height and have small enough openings that restrict animals and unauthorized people from entering the
facility. Correct by 12 July 2014.
3.131(d)
SANITATION. There were numerous rats observed in and around the red building that is located adjacent to the pig enclosure as
well as in the pigs' enclosure including their feeder. These rats were also seen drinking from the pigs' automatic
waterer. Rats can transmit diseases to the animals. A more effective method of pest control must be established to
control these rats. Correct by 26 June 2014.
