2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care the licensee provided at the time of inspection is not complete. There is no
adequate guidance from the attending veterinarian to provide preventative care or treatment for routine/common
veterinary problems. In order to ensure problems of animal health are addressed adequately, a written program of
veterinary care should include common health problems they have and how these will be addressed by the licensee
and attending veterinarian.
Formal arrangement with the Attending Veterinarian shall include a detailed written program of veterinary care.
To be corrected by: Next inspection
This is a new site visit. Inspection and exit briefing conducted with licensee.
