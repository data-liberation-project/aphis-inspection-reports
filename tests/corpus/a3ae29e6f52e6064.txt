FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(d) Perimeter fence.
***** At time of inspection the perimeter fence located along the service road running behind the Animal commissary
and infirmary had a section which was established with temporary panels that did not meet the required 8 ft. height
requirement which is needed for dangerous animals if the dangerous animal exhibits do not have an 8 ft. perimeter
fence around the exhibits themselves.
This fence is required to protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from
going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. Fences less than 8 ft in height for
dangerous animals must be approved by the Adminstrator in writing.
This section of perimeter fence needs to be replaced with a section of fence such as the 8ft. section of fence that is
located on each end of the temporary panels or the exhibits for dangerous animals must have a perimeter fence
erected around the exhibits.
