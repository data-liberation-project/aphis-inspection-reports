FEEDING.
***The metal food receptacles attached to the cages are rusty with a build up of grime, grit and dust. Build ups of
this nature increase the potential for disease. Food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitized at all times. These
food receptacles shall be cleaned and sanitized to promote proper husbandry practices and protect the health and
well being of the chinchillas. Correct by July 5, 2014.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The chinchilla enclosures have a build up dust and grime on the cage wiring. The suspended metal supports for
the cages aa well as some of the cages are pitted, flaking and rusty. Some of the wires have deteriorated and are
broken. The condition and structure of the cages do not allow for adequate cleaning and sanitizing. The rust has
compromized the structural strength of some of the enclosures and their support. The enclosures must be cleaned
and sanitized to minimize disease hazard and ensure the health and well being of the chinchillas.
