FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A screw was present on the top of the nesting box in an enclosure housing one Raccoon. The point of the screw
was exposed for approximately one inch straight up from the top. If the raccoon climbed to the top of the enclosure
it might tear the skin on the sharp screw, this would be especially likely as it descended from the top. A second
enclosure, housing two raccoon, had welded wire on one side that had become broken and loose from the side
support shared with the adjacent enclosure. The side support was scratched up indicating that the animals had
been working on this area and might loosen or break the wire to the point that it could injure or trap the animals.
Correct by assuring the housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by: 26 December 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Owner.
