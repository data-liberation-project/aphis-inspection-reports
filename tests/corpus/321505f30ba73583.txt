had not been observed by anyone at the facility and had not been reported to the attending veterinarian. According
to the president of the facility, Kahn and Sundar have a history of compatability issues with Kahn being dominated
by the other tiger. Kahn's condition should have been recognized by personnel at the facility and reported to the
attending veterinarian. Failure to observe health issues and promptly report them to the veterinarian will lead to
unnecessary suffering and even death. Kahn is suffering due to his current condition. Report his condition promptly
to the attending veterinarian.

Correct immediately by making thorough daily observations of all animals and reporting all health issues promptly to
the veterinarian.
3.83 DIRECTWATERING.
The regulations require that potable water must be provided to nonhuman primates no less than twice daily for one
hour each time. The water receptacle in this enclosure housing a snow macaque has a layer of snow over the ice in
its water receptacles. It is 1:06 PM and it is apparent that this animal has not yet been offered any water. It is vital
that this animal receive water to provide for its health and comfort. Provide water to this animal at least twice daily
for one hour each time.
Correct by: Correct immediately.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains moldy squash that were becoming soft. Spoiled produce must be removed promptly to
prevent contamination of food intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce promptly. The
produce cooler also contained a chainsaw which had been used for butchering a cow. The saw was still covered
with blood, meat and bone. The saw had been used at about 2:00 PM the day before according to the facility
president. The saw should be cleaned promptly after use and not stored in the produce cooler. This cooler needs
to be cleaned and have soiled and spoiled items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will
be fed to the animals.
The meat cooler has the odor of rotten and decaying meat. This odor makes it very hard to determine if the meat
items stored in this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the cooler, identify the source of the odor and
eliminate it.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelter housing the lama contained no bedding. The shelter housing the four alpacas contained no bedding.
The shelter housing the sheep contained very little bedding. The expected low temperature in the area for tonight is
nine degrees. The president stated that they planned to provide bedding this weekend. Failure to provide adequate
bedding will lead to discomfort and possible animal injury. This will lead to unnecessary animal suffering. Bedding
must be provided to these animals to provide for their health and comfort. Provide bedding for these animals.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence was noted to have an aproximately 10" by 24" gap under it. This gap appeared large enough
that a person might be able to squeeze under the fence. Small animal tracks in the snow could be seen in the gap.
It is apparent that some animal is using this gap to enter or exit the facility. This breach in the perimeter fence islocated about 20 yards away from the tigers housed on leopard row. This fence must be repaired in order to
prevent unauthorized persons from entering the facility and also to prevent the access of predators and to ensure
that the fence serves as a secondary containment for the animals in the facility.

3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The inspectors observed a partially processed cow hanging in the butcher area. This cow was being processed at
2:00 PM on Monday when some equipment used for processing broke according to the facility president. This cow
had been left hanging outside for about 20 hours at the time of inspection. The facility president stated that he still
intended to feed this cow to the animals at the facility. He also asked the inspectors how many of our regulated
facilities that we inspected left meat hanging outside and then used it for animal feed? We replied that none of the
facilities we inspected did that. Despite the freezing temperatures, it is not proper practice to leave processed meat
hanging outside. This meat can be no longer considered wholesome and free from contamination when stored in
this manner. It would be possible for any number of the rodents present at this facility to contaminate this meat.
Also due to the fact that bird droppings were noted by the inspectors in this area, contamination with avian fecal
material is a possibility. This meat must not be used for food.
Correct by: From this time forward all processed and partially processed meat should be stored properly or
discarded.
3.130 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
All of the enclosures housing the tigers and the enclosure housing one lion had water containers filled to the top
with solid ice. Five tigers were observed by the inspectors to be licking at the ice repeatedly. One tiger named
Kahn was also seen to be eating snow in additon to licking at the ice in the water container provided to him. The
puma had no water container in its enclosure. It did have a bucket of ice that the president of the facility said that
they were no longer using for the enclosure. The enclosure housing two coyotes had two water containers that
were solid ice and bones to the top of the containers. It is vital that all animals have access to water in order to
promote their health and comfort. Cats are particular sensitive to kidney damage from lack of water. Provide water
as often as neccessary to keep these animals comfortable. These animals should not be seen repeatedly licking
ice and eating snow. This is not normal behavior for these animals. These animals are suffering due to lack of
adequate water.
3.131(c)SANITATION.
The counter in the butcher area was covered with blood, meat, soiled knifes and tools and parts of a cow. The meat
saw and walls were covered in blood, fat and meat scraps. The produce cooler door was covered in blood and
tissue. The floor was covered in bird droppings and various items including: used gloves, twine and cardboard.
This area is used to butcher meat that is intended to be fed to the cats at this facility. This area must be kept clean
and sanitary in order to ensure the food is clean, wholesome and not contaminated when fed to the animals. Clean
and sanitize this area.
Correct by: This area must be cleaned and sanitized before it is used again for butchering.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was still rodent feces present on a shelf in the produce cooler. Mice can be carriers of disease and can
contaminate the produce stored in this area with their feces or by tracking fecal material from animal enclosures or
other contaminates into the produce cooler. A safe and effective means of controlling pests must be established for
the produce cooler and the entire facility. Establish a plan that eliminates mice from the produce cooler. The facility
president stated that they had not had time to clean the shelves in the produce cooler. He also stated that APHIS
inspectors were not expected until next week.
There were several rodent holes and a rat was seen by the inspector in the leopard barn which houses four tigers.
Rats can be carriers of disease which may be harmful to the animals housed in this area. A more effective means
of pest control must be established for this area.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. The president of the facility stated to
APHIS inspectors that there was no formalized scheduling of workers at the facility. A lack of properly trained
employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal sufering. Animal numbers
must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be added. Workers need to be trained in the basic
needs of the animals at the facility. Topics should include at a minimum: the importance of adequate water, the
need for adequate bedding during times of extreme weather, the importance of cleaning and good housekeeping
procedures and observation of animals for abnormal conditions and behaviors. This training should be done in
conjunction with the attending veterinarian or his designee. A list of topics covered and attendees must be
documented for review by APHIS. A facility schedule needs to be developed that allows for adequate employee
coverage in order to address all animal husbandry needs.Correct by: 3-26-14

SEPARATION.
The tiger known as Kahn is housed with a tiger known as Sundar. Kahn appears very thin with prominent hip and
back bones. There are patches of hair missing over the areas where Kahn's hip bones are prominent as well as at
the base of his tail. There is a lack of muscle in his hind quarters. Kahn has a 1/2" lesion across the tip of his nose
which is raw and irritated. There is a 4" lesion at the tip of Kahn's tail which is raw and irritated. According to the
president of the facility, Kahn and Sundar have a history of compatability issues with Kahn being dominated by the
other tiger. These animals should have been being monitored closely for compatability issues. These animals
should have been separated before Kahn's condition became so deteriorated. Kahn is suffering due to his current
condition. These animals need immediate separation.
Correct by: This tigers were separated at the time of inspection.
At the conclusion of the inspection, the APHIS inspectors went over the findings. APHIS expectations regarding the
tiger Kahn and his need for veterinary care by 12:00 PM (noon) on 3-5-14 and the need to immediately obtain water
for all the animals were communicated to the facility president. A formal exit interview was conducted on 3-5-14 at
12:00 PM (noon).
