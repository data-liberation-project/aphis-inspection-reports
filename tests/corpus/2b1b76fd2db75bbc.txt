2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 445 guinea pigs were counted during this
inspection including adults and offspring. There were no inventory records indicating the number of adults or newborns
born for the last few months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by
identifying animal losses and animals born. The facility must keep and maintain records containing the required
information which fully and correctly discloses the number of animals held, owned, acquired and disposed of including
births and deaths. Correct by July 10, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
