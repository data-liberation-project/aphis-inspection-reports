3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the German Shepherd building there are two enclosures, housing four adult dogs, which have dog houses
constructed of hard plastic and the dogs have excessively chewed and scratched them. The damage is located
around the bottom, sides and top of the entrance of the houses. In another enclosure, housing one adult dog, there
is a wooden board running across the bottom of the dog house entrance. The dog has excessively chewed and
shredded the board. In one enclosure, housing one adult dog, the blue plastic container attached to the front of the
enclosure has been excessively chewed and torn by the dog. The damage caused by the dogs does not allow for
proper cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces of the plastic houses, container and wooden board which could
increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
Any surface of housing facilities that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled.
The licensee must repair, replace, or alter the damaged areas of the plastic houses, container, and wooden board in
a manner that allows them to be properly cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of
housing facilities remain in good repair and are capable of being cleaned and sanitized in order to promote the
health of the dogs.
