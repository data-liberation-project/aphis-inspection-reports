3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Seven rubber bowls are used to feed 14 adult dogs and four puppies. These feed receptacles had an
accumulation of brown to grayish grime or debris and hair on their surfaces. This indicates that the feed receptacles
are not being cleaned and sanitized often enough. As a result this can increase the disease potential for the dogs.
For the prevention of an accumulation of grime, debris and dog hair, all feed receptacles must be cleaned and
sanitized more frequently. More frequent cleaning and sanitization will minimize the disease potential for the
animals.
