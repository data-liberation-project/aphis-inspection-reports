PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
Upon inspection of the records from auction sales on Feb. 3 & 4, 2017 and March 31 & April 1, 2017 it was apparent
that several animals were accepted for consignment from individuals without a valid USDA license. For example,
the following consignments for the February 2017 auction were from three unlicensed individuals: One kangaroo
#2696; three wallaby #1535,1536, and 1537; and one neutered skunk #4028. Examples of consignments from
unlicensed individuals for the March 31/April 1 auction included the following records: one ring-tailed lemur #4153;
one kinkajou #4018; eighteen sugar gliders of which more that five were females, lot #s 4009-4016; and a kangaroo
#2739 and zebra #2738. No official one-time exemption forms were included in the auction files provided to the
inspectors or in the Animal Care Information System. In order for APHIS Officials to track animal movement,
investigate disease outbreaks, and to prevent illegal movement the person consigning the regulated animals to the
auction sale must have a valid USDA License. The auction must not obtain an animal from any person who is
required to be licensed but who does not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license.
