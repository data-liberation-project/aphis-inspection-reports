3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The roof over the facility’s animal hospital and connected giraffe building are in disrepair. There are large sections of the
ceilings indoors (hallways, quarantine holding rooms, treatment areas) that are leaking from snow melt on the roof or rain
allowing water to come into the building. In a few areas, ceiling panels have collapsed from the weight of water. There is
evidence of water damage on walls and ceilings throughout the building and buckets on the floor collecting water. Water
damage this extensive can cause structural integrity issues with the building and allow water to get trapped in areas which
can become a breeding ground for mold. Soft sections of the roof can create openings for pests to get into the building
and create living areas for these animals. The roof of these buildings must be addressed and maintained in good repair to
keep the facilities structurally sound and to protect the safety and health of the animals.
