FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A compact florescent light bulb over the food preparation area was uncovered. In the event that the light bulb
cracked, pieces of glass could contaminate the food which could lead to injury to the animals if eaten. Additionally,
these bulbs typically contain mercury, which is poisonous.
A means of protecting the food preparation area and food from contamination from potential bulb breakage must be
used. Should a bulb break prior to correction, any affected food must be discarded and the area restored to proper
sanitation prior to re-use for preparing food.
