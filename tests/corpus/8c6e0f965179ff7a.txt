Four sheep and three goats were being held in a temporary enclosure for the facilities annual Halloween event.
The sheep and goats had no shelter from the sun or inclement weather. Temperatures have been in the 90’s
recently and the sheep had full or almost full coats of wool. This combination could easily lead to overheating in the
sheep. Lack of shelter from wind and rain can also be stressful and cause health problems.
The facility representative explained they had shelter but a recent storm had blown it down. They were given the
opportunity to provide some type of shelter by the end of the day on Oct 6th and asked to email a photo as
confirmation. Confirmation was never received.
Some type of shelter from sun and inclement weather needs to be provided in the temporary enclosure or the
animals need to be moved back to their permanent enclosure.
