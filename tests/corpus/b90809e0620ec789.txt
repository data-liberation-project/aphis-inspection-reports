The following dogs are in need of veterinary care:
*Female, adult, tricolored Papillion named "(cid:28)Evie"(cid:29) (no identification) had what the licensee described as (cid:28)"mastitis"(cid:29)
and was (cid:28)"worried that one of her two newborn puppies was not doing well and was going to pass away". The
puppies were whelped on 3/22 and the licensee gave the dam a dose of "(cid:28)Baytril"(cid:29). She reported that the mammary
glands felt solid the next day and she gave another dose of (cid:28)"Baytril"(cid:29). The licensee tried to feed the puppies with a
nipple and en eye dropper but the puppies did not eat well from those. She thought the puppies were nursing now
but had no additional plans for either the dam or the puppy she was concerned about. That puppy was thin in
appearance and appeared to be very quiet and still. She did not contact a veterinarian regarding this dog and did
not have documented approved directions for the approved use of the (cid:28)"Baytril"(cid:29). The puppy (no identification) died
during the time of our inspection. Correct nutrition for puppies is critical for their survival and comfort. Conditions
that affect the ability to produce milk can contribute to a lack of nutrition for puppies and be painful for the dam. In

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
None of the required paperwork was available for the inspectors at the time of the inspection. They licensee reports

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the posts supporting an outdoor enclosure has a support post that is on the edge of a hole in the dirt
underneath it. There is a PVC pipe used as a structural post on the north side of one of the buildings that is cracked
and structurally unsound. There are several wires underneath one of the outdoor runs on south side of the upper
deck of the south building that are rusted through and affect the integrity of the run. There are wires on the floors
and dividers of several of the indoor and outdoor enclosures that have deteriorated and have sharp points that could
injure the dogs. These areas of disrepair can make the enclosures structurally unsound or could injure the dogs.
The licensee must develop a system of monitoring and maintenance to ensure that facilities are kept in good repair,
protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely at all times. To be corrected by 17 April 2014.
3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.The floor on the interior portion of the enclosures behind the house has worn to the point that a porous material is
exposed that is not impervious to moisture and cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized. Inability to clean and
sanitize surfaces can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that the housing facilities be
constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or
replaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected by 27 May 2014.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A majority of the access doors both inside and outside of the north and south sheltered housing facilities have a
buildup of a dark brown grimy material. Many of the dividing walls of the outdoor enclosures have a buildup of a
brownish material, feces, and/or hair stuck in the wire at the base of these walls. A wall at the back of one of the
outdoor ground pens have a heavy accumulation of dirt, hair and old, dried fecal material stuck in the wire at ground
level. At least four plastic shelter structures have areas that are chewed to the point that the surface is roughened
and can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. Dirt and grime were visualized in these areas. Rodent
droppings have accumulated in and under the wash-downs of the south building. In the north building the automatic
waterers are leaking and causing rust and a green slimy buildup on the wire floors. Most of the water bowls in the
outdoor enclosures have a green material in the bottom. Many of the metal self-feeders have grime or other material
on the interior where the food is stored. At least two plastic shelter structures in the outdoor enclosures have straw
bedding that is dirty and clumped. Wooden dividers in some of the whelping building enclosures are chewed, worn,
and are no longer impervious to moisture.
Failure to appropriately clean and sanitize surfaces in housing facilities for dogs can result in an increase of the risk
of contamination and disease. All surfaces that come in contact with the dogs including food and water receptacles
and all other surfaces in the housing facilities must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized as needed but at least every
two weeks to prevent an accumulation of grime and prevent disease, odors and pests. Materials that get
contaminated must be replaced and all other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. To be corrected by 27 April 2014.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste materials including straw, gravel, dirt, and old, dried feces are present on the east side of the property next to
and pushing through the wooden fence. These piles are approximately three feet away from the dogs housed in the
outdoor enclosures near the fence. These materials could cause odors and can attract pests which could spread
disease. Licensee must provide for the regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of waste materials in
a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risk. To be corrected by 27 April 2014.The inspection was conducted with the licensee on 26 March 2014. A preliminary exit interview was also conducted
at that time. A final exit interview was conducted on 27 March 2014.
