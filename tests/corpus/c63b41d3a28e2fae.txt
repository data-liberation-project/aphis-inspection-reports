*** The greyish rabbit (no ID) was observed breathing with great effort. There are missing hairs and a brownish dry
crusty material around the nose of the rabbit. There is a loose flap of skin over the nose. According to the caretaker
the rabbit was treated with tetracycline for 3 days and has not been treated for the past 3 days. There are no
records to indicate treatment was received. The treatment has not resolved the condition of the rabbit prolonging the
animals suffering. At the time of inspection, the rabbit is showing signs of respiratory distress.
*** One chinchilla (in top cage with one other chinchilla) is slightly hunched in the corner of the cage, with eyes
partially closed. The chinchilla is also minimally responsive to stimuli. The animal appears to be lethargic and in
poor health. NOTE: The other two chinchillas jumped in response to my presence and touching the cage.
The rabbit and chinchillas must be examined by a veterinarian by March 1, 2016 for an appropriate diagnosis and
treatment plan. The licensee must establish and maintain a program of veterinary care that ensure appropriate
methods to prevent, diagnose, and control disease and illness.
***Three chinchillas have coats that appear ruffled and are moderately oily. According to the caretaker, the
chinchillas receive a dust bath once a week. The chinchillas must be examined by a veterinarian to assess the
condition of the chinchilla(cid:25)s coats. To ensure the animals maintain a healthy coat, discuss with the attending
veterinarian the requirements for the frequency of providing a dust bath and husbandry practices. Correct by March
1, 2016

2.40 (b)(3) CRITICAL
*** Although the caretaker noticed the condition of the rabbit treatment was implemented without consulting the
attending veterinarian. The USDA inspector identified the sick chinchilla during this routine inspection. The licensee
provided no documentation of care or knowledge of any illness for the chinchillas.The attending veterinarian was notcontacted regarding the health of the animals.
The licensee failed to adequately observe the animals for illness and failed to promptly contact the attending
veterinarian regarding the health of the rabbit and chinchillas. There must be prompt, direct and frequent contact
with the attending veterinarian on matters of animal health. To ensure the health of the animals, there must be a
system in place that ensures the attending veterinarian is consulted in a timely manner when an animal is observed
to be showing signs of illness. The licensee must establish a system that provides direct and frequent contact with
the attending veterinarian by March 3, 2016.

2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** There is no documentation of the acquisition of 11 rabbits and 3 chinchillas present at the time of inspection.
Gerbils and hamsters were sold since the last inspection, however there is no documentation of the disposition of
these animals. Hamster records do not have the date of acquisition. There are no records of the birth for hamsters
and gerbils. The acquisition and disposition of all animals must be documented to ensure that all animals are
accounted for and receive appropriate care.
The records of acquisition and disposition are incomplete. A dealer must keep and maintain records of animals
born, bought, or acquired by donation; and sold, died, or euthanized. These records must indicate the seller and the
date animals were born, received or bought, or sold, died or euthanized. A system for effectively tracking the
acquisitions and dispositions of animals must be established and maintained. The records must be updated to
reflect the current animal population, including dates, to facilitate the enforcement of the regulations in the Animal
Welfare Act. Records of dispositions and acquisitions must be accurately maintained in accordance with 2.75 (b)(1)
to ensure compliance with the regulations of the Animals Welfare Act.
