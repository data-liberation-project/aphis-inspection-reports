2.1(a)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This person sold a male camel to a Class B exotic auction on April 1, 2016. Previously, this person was notified by
a USDA inspector and sent notification by mail from USDA advising that no regulated activity, including the sale of
camels was permitted without a USDA license.
During this search inspection, the wife stated that she thought paperwork was sent in for a license but the current
database shows no active USDA license.
The sale of camels without a USDA license is in violation of Section 2.1 and does not provide oversight for the
animals covered by the Animal Welfare Act.
An application packet was sent certified mail with this inspection report.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDCUTED UNTIL A USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED
