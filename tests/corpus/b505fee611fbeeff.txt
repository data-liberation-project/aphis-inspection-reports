Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 759 adult guinea pigs, 144 weanlings, and
609 newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records of the number of adults, weanlings,
and newborns present for the last few months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health
of the caviary by identifying guinea pig additions and losses by deaths or decrease numbers of animals born or animals
kept for replacements. The facility must maintain complete records containing the required information which fully and
correctly discloses the number of guinea pigs held, owned, including births and deaths, and sale of animals. Remains
uncorrected.
3.26(d) Repeat

Facilities, indoor.
Interior surfaces. The front wooden wall by the ladder is still not sealed or covered with an impervious surface. Indoor
surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can absorb moisture and liquids, retain odors, and do not allow adequate
cleaning and sanitization of room surfaces. Licensee must ensure that room surfaces are impervious to moisture so that
they can be repeatedly cleaned and sanitized, won't retain odors, and don't absorb moisture or liquids. Remains
uncorrected.
3.31(a)(1) Repeat


Sanitation.
There is a buildup of brown roughened scale and staining on the solid plastic sides and floors of guinea pig enclosures.
The buildup of organic material such as this can make disinfectants ineffective. Inadequate cleaning and sanitization can
expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Licensee must ensure
that enclosures are cleaned often enough to prevent a building of organic material. In addition, enclosure must be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Remans uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
