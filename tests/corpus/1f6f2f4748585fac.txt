FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The inspector smelled a strong odor when entering the indoor building that houses the sugar gliders. The inspector
noted that several fans were running however the fans were not able to adequately provide enough fresh air to
reduce odors. At the time of the inspection the cooling system had a mechanical failure and was in the process of
being repaired. Excess odors could cause discomfort and health problems for the sugar gliders. Facilities shall
provide adequate ventilation for the health of the animals and to prevent discomfort in the animals. Adequate
ventilation is required to eliminate strong odors.

SANITATION.
There were four primary enclosures for the sugar gliders that had a brown sticky looking substance on the black
wires of the cages. The four larger primary enclosures that house several sugar gliders should be cleaned more
often to adequately maintain cages and reduce odors. This could cause disease and unhealthy living conditions for
the sugar gliders. Excreta shall be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. All primary enclosures for the sugar gliders
need to be cleaned and maintained as often as needed in order to create an adequate healthy living environment
for the sugar gliders.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
