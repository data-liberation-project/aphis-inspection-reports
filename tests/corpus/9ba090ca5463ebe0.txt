FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the rabbit enclosures housing two rabbits needs to be addressed. One link that secures the shelf is
unattached which is causing the shelf to lean downward. In addition wood has been chewed exposing nails in the
enclosure. This enclosure needs to be kept in good repair for the safety for the rabbits.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The side wire mesh panel in the coati enclosure is in disrepair with a hole in the mesh and broken wires. This
hole is a big enough gap that the animal could potentially get out if it tried to. This section of mesh needs to be
addressed to keep the enclosure in good repair and for the containment of the animal.
*** Sections of the wire mesh for the fox enclosure are weak and have small openings if the animals push on the
mesh in those areas. The structural integrity of this enclosure needs to be checked all around to prevent any other
potential escapes.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The current perimeter fence is only 4 feet high and is not of sufficient height to keep animals contained if they
are out of the primary enclosure. The foxes are housed in a primary enclosure which is accessed through an
employee lock out area to prevent escapes. The New Guinea Singing Dog has been moved to another enclosure
that does not have an employee lock out area so there is no secondary containment for that animal.
On Feb 23, 2017 an arctic fox escaped from the primary enclosure then was able to get out of the employee lock
out area and finally escaped from the facility. The animal was recaptured approximately 5 days later. These animalsneed to be housed behind a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons
out and acts as a secondary containment for the animals. Fences less than 6 feet high for animals must be
approved in writing by the Administrator.
