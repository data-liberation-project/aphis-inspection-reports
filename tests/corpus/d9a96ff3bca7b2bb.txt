ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1709 on
04/25/2016. I contacted the licensee by phone and left a message. I also honked my car horn and waited in my
vehicle outside the gate of the facility for thirty minutes before leaving. I received no phone call back from the
licensee.
End of report.
