ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A written Program of Veterinary Care was not available for the animals other than reindeer housed at the facility.
The facility employs an attending veterinarian for the reindeer, however, there are other species such as rabbits and
calves housed at the facility at certain times throughout the year. The facility must work with a veterinarian to
develop and document a program of veterinary care for these species, and this must include provisions for parasite
control, adequate nutrition, euthanasia and emergency coverage.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A discussion with the facilities Attending Veterinarian revealed that there was an instance in July 2015 where
treatment was prescribed for a female reindeer, however, on a follow-up visit the facility had not followed the
veterinarians recommendations. Failing to follow the veterinary instructions can cause the animals unnecessary
pain and distress. The licensee must ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the
provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate restraint equipment for the reindeer is not available at the facility. In the past the facility staff members
"manhandle" and manually restrain the reindeer when needed. This can cause unnecessary stress to the animals,
and possibly cause an animal to become injured. The attending veterinarian has discussed this necessity with the
facility representatives multiple times, however no provisions were ever made in order to make a restraint chute
available for physical examinations, routine TB testing and hands-on observations by the husbandry staff. The
licensee must ensure that appropriate equipment is provided as part of the program of veterinary care. ***********Correct by April 1, 2016

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is no shelter provided for six reindeer in an outdoor paddock. This inspection was conducted in January with
extreme temperatures and these animals did not have a way to escape the inclement weather. Shelter must be
provided to these animals in order to protect them from the sunlight and the inclement weather. The facility must
develop a means to provide these animals with shelter.

SANITATION.
A discussion with husbandry personnel and the Attending veterinarian revealed the enclosure for the reindeer had
not been sanitized in years, if ever. The facility has recently been having parasite control issues and the attending
veterinarian has discussed the need for pasture rotation/sanitization in an effort to reduce parasite burderns for
these animals. Measures need to be taken, with the attending vet direction, as to the best means to go about
pasture sanitization, either by rotation or mechanical means. Enclosures such as pastures must be sanitized as
often as necessary as directed by the attending veterinarian.************Correct by April 1, 2016
