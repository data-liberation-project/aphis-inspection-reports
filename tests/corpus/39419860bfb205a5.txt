***The tail tip of the male coati mundi had an active lesion requiring veterinary attention/treatment. The lesion on
end of the tail tip was circular in shape measuring approximately 0.5 inches, was moist and reddened.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on May 9, 2016, to obtain accurate
diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issue cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be
provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all
diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed
along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when
the medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate
veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Neither the facility employees or the licensee observed the lesion requiring veterinary attention on the male coati
mundi. Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and
well-being are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or
behavior must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure
adequate care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain andsuffering and the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct daily
observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by 5/3/16.
2.50(c)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***The four puppies on exhibit at the time of inspection did not have any identification. Official identification is
needed to ensure that each animal(cid:25)s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the inspection process.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs are officially identified by an APHIS approved identification method.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The licensee did not have records that contained the required information regarding the acquisition and
disposition of animals used or co-mingled with animals used in regulated activities. There were no records of
acquisition for the four puppies the licensee was exhibiting at the time of inspection.
Records containing the required information for animals acquired for use in regulated activities, including those
offspring born on premise, need to be made and maintained in order to properly track the animal numbers and use
in those activities. Each dealer and exhibitor shall use Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS
Form 7005) and Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) to make, keep, and maintain the
required information.

3.4(a)(1)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***The licensee was exhibiting four puppies, approximately six weeks old, in an outdoor enclosure at the time of
inspection without prior approval from the attending veterinarian. The licensee stated she had put the puppies
outdoors for a few hours. Young dogs must not be kept in outdoor enclosures as they are not acclimated to
temperature extremes, changing weather conditions, and are susceptible to disease transmission without prior
approval from the AV.
The facility must ensure sick, infirm, aged or young dogs or cats are not kept in outdoor facilities unless approved by
the attending veterinarian.
Corrected at the time of inspection.3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***The licensee was exhibiting four puppies, approximately six weeks old, in an outdoor enclosure at the time of
inspection without a shelter structure. Without access to a shelter, dogs housed outdoors do not have protection
from changing weather conditions. The facility must ensure all outdoor facilities for dogs and cats has one or more
shelter structures that are accessible to each animal.
Correct at the time of inspection.
3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
***The licensee was exhibiting four puppies, approximately six weeks old, without an exercise plan. An exercise
plan is used to ensure all dogs are provided with the opportunity for exercise. The facility must develop, document,
and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. In addition, the plan must be
approved by the attending veterinarian. The plan must include written standard procedures to be followed in
providing the opportunity for exercise and the plan must be made available to APHIS upon request.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The feeding station in the enclosure housing 5 camels is in need of repair or replacement. One of the legs on the
structure is rusted with sharp, jagged edges. The feeding station poses a risk of injury to the animals and can
decrease the structural stability of the structure.
*** The chain link material in the enclosure housing 1 fennec fox is twisted inward with several sharp points. The
fencing material was not maintained in good repair to protect the animal from injury.
***The enclosure housing 7 sheep and 4 goats had a feeder bottom that was rusted out and missing in several
sections with sharp edges. The rusted sections pose a risk of injury to the animals.
*** The chain link material in an area 7 pigs have access to is turned up and in with several sharp points. The
fencing material was not maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury or to contain the animals.
***The enclosure housing 13 goats has a metal structure that is excessively rusted at the bottom with sharp edges.
The rusted sections pose a risk of injury to the animals.
Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The affected
structures must be repaired or replaced and all housing facilities should be maintained and kept structurally soundto protect and contain the animals moving forward.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***One female camel had several flies on and around her face. Due to her age and limited mobility, this camel was
unable to shake off the flies as compared to the other camels. Excessive amounts of flies on or around the animals
can be stressful to the animal and disease can be transmitted by the pests to the animals and can contaminate feed
and water. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in all animal areas.
This was corrected at the time of inspection as the licensee applied fly repellant to the animal.
Inspection was conducted with the animal manager and APHIS personnel including Compliance Specialist Jean
Bolinger and Veterinary Medical Officer Aaron Rhyner.
Exit briefing was conducted with the animal manager, owner and APHIS personnel including Compliance Specialist
Jean Bolinger and Veterinary Medical Officer Aaron Rhyner.
