PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were exposed, protruding ends of wire from the metal chain link fencing material at the bottom portion of the
dividing panels between enclosures of three outdoor dog kennel runs. The primary enclosures must be
constructed, kept in good repair and maintained to ensure no sharp points from protruding wires cause the animals
to be injured, trapped, or harmed.
Licensee stated that dogs in kennels with protruding wires would be moved to other enclosures until repairs are
made to these kennels. Correct by 09-24-14

WATERING.
Most of the water receptacles in the outdoor, dog kennel runs were dirty. Some had a greenish discoloration to the
surface of the container, while one receptacle contained completely opaque water with a large growth of algae.
Water receptacles must be kept clean and contain potable water to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs. A
system of a more frequent cleaning and sanitizing schedule must be in place.
Corrected during inspection.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A closed food storage shed used to store food for five llamas contained bales of hay that were stacked directly on
the ground and against the walls of the shed. The ground of the shed was covered with hay from broken bales and
un-stacked bales. There was an opened bag of feed used for a non-covered species stored directly next to the
Llama'(cid:25)s supply of hay. A system of food protection and storage in facilities must be in place which adequately
prevents against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin.

SANITATION.
An outdoor, sheltered housing area containing one llama had an excessive buildup of excreta on the ground of this
shelter. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained and
to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of this enclosure should be more frequent and
effective to prevent the buildup of excreta.
