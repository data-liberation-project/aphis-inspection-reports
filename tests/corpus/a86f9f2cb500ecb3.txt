3.39(a) CRITICAL
CARE IN TRANSIT.
The licensee sold 40 guinea pigs to a facility. The licensees' employee transported 8 boxes of guinea pigs to the
facility approximately 8 hours away. Each transport box used holds 5 guinea pigs. Upon arrival at the facility it was
found that one box had shifted during transport and was directly next to the heating vent. 3 of the 5 guinea pigs in
the transport box had died due to overheating and the remaining 2 were in distress but have since recovered.
During surface transportation, it shall be the responsibility of the driver or other employee to visually observe the live
guinea pigs or hamsters as frequently as circumstances may dictate, but not less than once every 4 hours, to
assure that they are receiving sufficient air for normal breathing, their ambient temperatures are within the
prescribed limits.
Guinea pigs must be checked on during transport to ensure they are receiving sufficient air and the proper
temperatures are maintained to prevent overheating and death.
The licensee reported this incident to APHIS and has already taken corrective actions to ensure that this does not
happen during transportation of guinea pigs in the future.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
