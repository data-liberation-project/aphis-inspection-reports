3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A section of the perimeter fence was severely damaged, and does not currently prevent animals and people from
passing through the fence. Sections of chain-link are fastened to metal posts approximately eight to ten feet apart,
and four sections were affected. In two of the sections the chain-link is crumpled down so low that it is easy to step
through the fence.
Although the bison have been moved to an adjacent pasture, and there is another fence separating them from the
damaged section, that fence is not dog-proof, as there are gaps under gates, of eight inches or more, and there is
no barrier to prevent an intruder from having contact with the bison through the fence, once inside.
The damage to the fence reportedly occurred more than seven days ago, and was caused by a falling tree branch.
Immediate temporary measures should have been taken to prevent people and animals from being able to pass
through the fence. The police barricades and yellow plastic caution tape do not achieve this goal.
The perimeter fence must be maintained so as to protect the animals within by preventing outside animals and
people from entering the enclosure. Failure to keep animals and people out could put the health and well-being of
the bison at risk.
Note: The exhibitor has recently completed an extensive project to improve the existing perimeter fence by
eliminating gaps underneath the fence, and these modifications are excellent.
This is a repeat citation which previously involved recurring gaps underneath the fence, and was cited previously on
January 11, 2012, January 4, 2013, and April 18, 2013.
An exit interview was completed with a facility representative.
