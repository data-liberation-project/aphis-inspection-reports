Facilities, general.
An approximately 4 year old female cougar is housed in a primary enclosure constructed with cattle panels that have 6" x
8" openings between the wires that allow her to fit her whole head or paws through. Even though the area is not
accessible to anyone except the licensee, the primary enclosure fails to adequately contain the animal and could lead to
escape or injury of the animal or human caretakers. Correct by ensuring that the primary enclosure can adequately and
completely contain the animal by March 15, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
