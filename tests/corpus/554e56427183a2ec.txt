WATERING.
There are accumulations of brown debris around the automatic water valves and on the PVC drain piece below the
water receptacles. These accumulations around the water valves and drain pieces exposes the guinea pigs to
potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungi, and parasites. Water receptacles such as automatic water valves
and drain lines must be kept clean and sanitized whenever dirty, and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
Inadequate cleaning and sanitation of the water valves and drain lines can result in contamination of the guinea pigs
in the same enclosure and may cause bedding to get wet around the water receptacles. Licensee must establish
and maintain a program to keep the water valves and drain pieces clean when dirty, and sanitized and least once
every 2 weeks.
