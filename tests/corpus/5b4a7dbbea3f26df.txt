2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male Yorkie with microchip #4B01406E44 had dark material adhered to his teeth at the previous inspection on
August 27, 2015. At that time it was recommended the dog be examined by a licensed veterinarian and have his
dental needs addressed. Licensee phoned the veterinarian the day of inspection and discussed the dog. The
veterinarian was planning to visit the next week, so it was decided she would examine the dog at that time. Kennel
notes record the veterinarian visited September 3, 2015 and checked some teeth during her visit. This is the only
record of the visit available today. There is no documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and plan
for this dog. Nor is there an improved dental care plan for the kennel. Licensee's wife stated the veterinarian said
that she would provide a plan within a week of the visit, and as long as the dog was eating and drinking, there was
no rush to have his dental needs addressed. It was understood that the Licensee could bring him in the next time
they are to come to the clinic. There is no plan to do this at this time. Nor has the dental care plan been received.
Licensee scraped some of the dark material off of this dog's teeth yesterday. The teeth are cleaner, but the gums
continue to be red and swollen. A grey/green fluid is accumulated along the gum line around several teeth. Some of
the upper incisors are loose. When touching the third upper premolar on the left side, the dog yelped and pulled
away. This response was repeated each time the tooth was lightly touched. This dog is in pain. Dental disease is
painful and is a source of contamination for other body systems. Licensee must use appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian
for diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and plan shall be
maintained for examination by APHIS officials. Licensee must develop an improved dental care plan to help
maintain optimal dental health for all kennel dogs.
