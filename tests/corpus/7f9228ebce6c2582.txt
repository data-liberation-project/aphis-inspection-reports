ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspector arrived at 10:00 AM on 8/26/15 to conduct an inspection but the Licensee was not at home. The
Licensee was reached by phone and it was learned that she was at an off-site location and would not return home
until much later in the day. An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other
responsible adult facility representative available to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility
and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of the Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 8/27/15.
