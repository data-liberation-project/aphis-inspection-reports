ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A pig in the petting zoo area was found to be grossly obese. She had difficulty walking, after being coaxed to stand,
and vocalized in a manner suggestive of discomfort. Her belly nearly touched the ground while standing. She
quickly returned to lying down. Additionally, her hooves in the front were overgrown, adding to her gait impairment.
At the educational facility there were two rabbits and one guinea pig. The toenails on these three animals were
overgrown to the point that they were curling up in different directions, and causing an abnormal angle to the toes
when the animals were standing. Additionally one rabbit had mats, and a sticky substance, in its fur.
Obesity can cause discomfort, distress, and seriously affect the overall health of the animal. Overgrown toenails can
cause gait abnormalities and discomfort. Matted fur can be painful to the animal.
Animal records did not indicate that any of these problems had been recognized or addressed. Failure to recognize
and address problems with the health and well-being of the animals results in unnecessary suffering. Steps should
be taken to ensure that any problems with the animals are recognized in timely manner; addressed with proper
husbandry, and / or veterinary consultation when appropriate, and preferably documented so as to show
compliance.
All issues to be corrected and documented by 9/28/15.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
