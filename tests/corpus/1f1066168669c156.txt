ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A three year old tan and white Pomeranian female (Wendy Mae, ID# 941000016857544) had an area of hair loss
measuring 4 inches by 4 inches on tail base that has not fully grown back after being shaved before she whelped in
February 2017. The underlying skin is dark grey where the hair failed to grow. The dog did not appear to be
scratching at the area. There is no treatment record or diagnosis for this dog. According to the veterinary handbook,
dogs that are not itching, but the hair does not grow back, should be examined by the attending veterinarian for
hormonal or immune disorders. A number of issues can cause skin disorders in dogs. This dog needs to be seen by
the attending veterinarian for an evaluation and diagnosis. Correct by Monday, July 10, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and AC Extern.
