Section 3.127(c) Drainage: The ground in the shelter for the enclosure housing four white-tailed deer to the right of
the house is wet and muddy. Dirt was dug out of the floor of the shelter when it was being repaired. It appears that
the floor of the shelter is now one of the lowest spots in the enclosure and water runs down the hillside and drains
into the shelter. The drainage for the enclosure must prevent water from accumulating and running through the
shelter so the shelter can protect and prevent discomfort for the animals during inclement weather. Correct by
ensuring the method of drainage for the enclosure keeps the shelter dry for the health and comfort of the animals.
Correct by September 15, 2016.
