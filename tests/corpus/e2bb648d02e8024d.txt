2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
Based upon information received in a complaint and obtained from the Pony-To-Go website and social media
activity, Pony-To-Go is conducting regulated activity without a USDA license. On December 30, 2016, I visited the
George Washington Mount Vernon tourist attraction and observed "Aladdin" the camel, who is owed by
Pony-To-Go, on exhibit to the public. Additionally, Pony-To-Go advertises a petting zoo for events and occasions.
Any person operating as an exhibitor must obtain a USDA license and be subject to inspection by an APHIS official.
Pony-To-Go must obtain an exhibitor license for its current business activity in accordance with the Animal Welfare
Act.
CONDUCTING REGULATED ACTIVITY WITHOUT A VALID USDA LICENSE IS A VIOLATION OF THE ANIMAL
WELFARE ACT.
