3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The kennel facility consists of one sheltered building where all contained animals have access to both indoor and
outdoor primary enclosure portions. On the interior and exterior of the shelter building there are twelve enclosure
portions. All of the enclosures need to be cleaned to remove the build-up of dark matter and hair on the walls,
floors, doors and divider panels. The dealer stated he cleaned every one to two weeks. Through out the common
areas of the kennel building there are accumulations of dead insects, spilt food, used syringes, dark matter under
the puppy stack cages and wall insulation material. Hard surfaces which the dogs come in contact must be
spot-cleaned daily to prevent accumulations of excreta and reduce disease hazards. All other surfaces of housing
facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices to protect the health and welfare of the animals.
