3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing a zebra gelding, Zig Zag, had several areas that were in disrepair and posed a risk of injury
to the animal:
**The cattle panel fencing on the west side of the enclosure had 2-3 broken and bent metal spanners with sharp
ends.
**The shelter structure had broken and unsecured wooden cross-supports and which exposed the sharp ends of the
wood screws.
**The shelter structure also had bent and unsecured metal with sharp ends exposed and two wires on one of the
support posts that had sharp ends protruding.
Broken supports may reduce the structural integrity of the fencing and shelter structure and sharp points pose a risk
of injury should the zebra come in contact with these.
Outdoor housing facilities for animals shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility does not have a perimeter fence that encloses the outdoor housing for zebra and camels. There is a 6
foot high fence that exists on the north side of these enclosures but the top wooden support is broken and
unsecured, which reduces the height to below 6 feet and is in disrepair. The licensee has placed posts on the south
side of these enclosures but no fencing material was attached and there was only a 5 foot high, 5 strand wire fence
between the east gate and these enclosures.
Incomplete fencing or fencing that is not maintained in good repair will not adequately prevent unauthorized persons
from entering the facility, may not prevent animals that could prey on or expose the exhibition animals to disease, or
function to contain the animals effectively should they escape from their primary enclosure.Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height and must be constructed
so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment
system for the animals in the facility.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee, AC VMO, and AC Intern.
