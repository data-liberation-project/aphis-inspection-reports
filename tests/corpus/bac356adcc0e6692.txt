2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:40 pm on
22-Feb-17. In addition to knocking on the residence door, honking the horn at the kennel and waiting 20 minutes, I
called the phone number provided and left a message.
This attempted inspection will be sent both regular and certified mail.
