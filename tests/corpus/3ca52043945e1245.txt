3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The humidity level before 11 am in the indoor dog and cat housing rooms was already over 70% (for example, the
digital readout in the large dog room was 76% and odors associated with the dogs/dog excreta appeared stronger
than would normally be expected based on the room conditions). Review of room logs for the past few days in June
2014 showed minimum humidity readings of 73-94% and maximum humidity readings of 96-98%. Review of room
logs for 17 days of Jan 2014 showed that the average minimum humidity level was about 20% with a range of
3-32% and the average maximum humidity level was about 47% with a range of 29-98%. Review of the last four
semi-annual IACUC facility inspection evaluations and reports showed that the humidity issues were noted as a
minor deficiency on three of the four evaluations. A note had been made in the corresponding documentation that
the odor was stronger in the rooms than usual in the most recent evaluation (May 2014). Humidiy levels of indoor
facilities should be able to be maintained between 30 and 70% and in accordance with generally accepted
professional and husbandry practices to provide for the health and well-being of the animals and to minimize odors,
ammonia levels and moisture condensation. Correct by 8/5/14.
