Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (e) Storage.
**** In the garage there are several bags of dog food sitting on the ground and one bag had been opened possible
by the cat. Food that is stored incorrectly allows the food to be contaminated and spoilage that reduces its
nutritional value. The licensee must store unopened bags of feed off the ground and away from the walls. Opened
bags must be stored in leakproof containers with tight fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.
