2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not address all species at the facility. Licensees' with part time
attending veterinarians must have a formal written arrangement with a veterinarian (PVC) that addresses the
preventive care for all regulated species. This is required so that USDA personnel can confirm that the licensee is
working with a veterinarian and is following the recommendations from that veterinarian.
A program of veterinary care needs to be developed for this facility by the attending veterinarian that includes
recommendations for all regulated species at the facility. Examples of topics to be covered in the PVC are:
*The veterinarian's schedule for visits to the facility.
*Parasite control program if appropriate for the species.
*Vaccination recommendations if appropriate for the species.
*Routine medical testing if appropriate for the species.
*Instructions on necropsies for unexpected deaths.
*Hoof trims for animals with chronic hoof problems.
*Any other medical/husbandry recommendations the veterinarian feels necessary for this facility.
*Emergency contact information.
The PVC must be signed and dated by the attending veterinarian. This document must indicate to USDA
representatives that the licensee and the veterinarian have an active working relationship. To be corrected by:
December 1, 2015.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several hoofed stock appear thin with prominent hip bones and ribs. The thin hoof stock include multiple white
tailed deer, one spotted deer, one zebu, several hog deer, one addax, and one lechwe. The licensee is responsible
for ensuring all animals receive adequate veterinary care in order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases
and injuries. These animals must be evaluated by a veterinarian to assess their body conditions and develop anappropriate treatment plan. To be corrected by: November 6, 2015.
One female zebu has front feet that are so long the hooves are curling upward. When she walks her gait is
adversely affected by these long front hooves. According to the licensee this animal has to be taken to the
veterinarian in order to adequately trim its hooves. The licensee is responsible for ensuring that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care in order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This animal must
be seen by a veterinarian and appropriate hoof care performed. To be corrected by: November 6, 2015.
3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of this inspection the licensee did not have a plan for environmental enrichment for the primates. An
enrichment plan approved by the attending veterinarian needs to be developed that includes specific provisions
such as appropriate social grouping and providing means of expressing species typical behaviors (such as swings
and perches). To be corrected by: December 1, 2015.
3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the central part of the ringtail lemur breeding building, there is an equipment storage area which has a lot of
clutter and debris laying on the floor such as empty plastic containers, metal barrels, pieces of PVC pipe, rusty
chains, and pieces of wire. Small pieces of Styrofoam-like material were noted in this equipment storage area by
the bottom of the overhead doors which may indicate a rodent problem in this area. Trash must be properly
disposed of and maintenance supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls to allow cleaning
underneath and around the supplies. Buildings for non-human primates must be kept clean and in good repair in
order to protect the health and well-being of all animals housed inside this facility. To be corrected by: October 30,
2015.
3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At the time of this inspection, there were three ringtail lemurs in one cage inside the pump house building. There
was evidence of rodent feces at the junction of the wall and floor in several locations in this building. Several small
wild birds were seen inside of this building at the time of this inspection. There was a significant accumulation of
bird fecal material on the wooden rafters directly above the primate cage in this building and on the concrete
flooring. Birds and rodents can transmit disease and other health risks to the animals. An effective pest control
program must be established and maintained to protect the health and well-being of the non-human primates in this
building. To be corrected by October 30, 2015.3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the front addax outdoor enclosure, there are several layers of fencing material along the bottom of the chain link
fence. There are pieces of wire protruding inwards along the bottom of this fence which could injure the animals.
These areas of broken fencing must be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by:
December 31, 2015.
The section of the chain link fence by the white tail deer runway is being held to the metal top rail by string. The
string could break allowing animals to escape or become entangled in the fence. This area of fencing must be
repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by: December 31, 2015.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are seventeen ibex housed together in one outdoor enclosure with one shelter. One piece of plywood
appears to have become detached from this shelter structure is laying on the ground. This shelter is not wide
enough to comfortably house all of the ibex during inclement weather. This shelter must be repaired and expanded;
or an additional outdoor shelter provided; in order to provide adequate shelter for all of the ibex. To be corrected by:
December 31, 2015.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
At the time of this inspection, the outdoor serval yard had a large accumulation of dried, white fecal material. Feces
must be removed from animal enclosures as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
Routine cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures must be done frequently to protect the health and well-being
of the one serval housed in this enclosure. To be corrected by: October 30, 2015.
