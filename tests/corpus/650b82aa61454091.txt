2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public barrier in front of the jaguar enclosures is inadequate. The public can make contact with animals while
they are in their primary enclosure. There is 1 enclosure housing 1 adult female and 1 adult male jaguars and an
adjacent enclosure housing 1 adult male jaguar. There is a stone barrier in front of these enclosures that is
approximately 3’ high and 4’ from the metal fencing, the area in-between contains thorny low growing plants. The
metal squares of the enclosure fencing have openings that are 2” x 4”. Members of the public are able to reach out
and touch the bars of these enclosures. A facility representative stated that 2 members of the public have leaned
over the barrier and were scratched by the 3.5 year old adult female jaguar ‘Sara’. One incident was in March 2019
and another incident occurred in the summer of 2018.
Failure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the viewing public may pose a risk of
harm to the animal and to the public. A sufficient barrier system must be in place to assure the safety of all animals
and the public.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals
and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
