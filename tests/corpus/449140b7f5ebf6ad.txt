Housing facilities, general.
The housing facilities for the nonhuman primates are in need of repair. The following issues were identified:
*Owl monkey sheltered housing: One wood beam used for perching in the outdoor portion of enclosure #2 has been
damaged and is deteriorating such that half the thickness of the wood is gone at one end.
*Capuchin monkey sheltered housing: The 'impervious to moisture' wall boards in the hallway near the entrance door are
loose and peeling from the walls leading to exposed bare wood. A section of linoleum flooring just inside the doorway was
damaged and removed leaving exposed bare wood. The sheet metal edge at the far end of the outside of the building is
damaged with multiple small sharp metal edges/pieces present. One capuchin in the adjoining enclosure (outdoor portion)
was seen touching the metal edges through the enclosure fencing.
Housing facilities that are not structurally sound may lead to injury of the monkeys and housekeeping issues.
The facility shall keep all housing facilities for the nonhuman primates in good repair. Correct by April 15, 2022.

Feeding.
The outdoor food receptacles for the ‘monkey biscuits’ are currently attached to the outside of the sheltered housing
enclosures and are open to the weather elements and to contamination by pests. The monkeys can reach through the


enclosure fencing openings to remove a biscuit and bring it into the enclosure to eat. No contaminated or wet feed was
identified today but it was a dry and clear day. Wet feed could potentially lead to deterioration of the nutritive value of the
feed and molding of feed not eaten promptly.
The facility shall ensure the food receptacles are located appropriately and measures are taken so there is no molding,
deterioration, caking or wetting of food placed in the feeders. Correct by April 15, 2022.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Two primary enclosures housing capuchins in the indoor capuchin building are in need of cleaning. The licensee reports
the enclosures are sprayed every morning to clean them and had been cleaned earlier in the day but cleaning issues
were identified in the afternoon. The enclosure housing the male capuchin itself was clean but there was an accumulation
of food waste and excreta underneath and behind the enclosure. Apparently these are difficult areas to reach. The floor of
the female capuchin's enclosure had a thin layer of smeared excreta covering the floor. It appeared as if water/fluids on
the floor wetted and spread the fecal material. The bars of the enclosure had material the color of the fecal material and
feed biscuits smeared on them. The bottom of the feet of the capuchin were soiled by the material. A few flies were noted
in the building. Accumulations of excreta and food waste can lead to soiling of the animals, attract pests and spread
disease/infection.
The facility must remove excreta and food waste from inside each enclosure daily and from underneath them as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the nonhuman primates from
becoming soiled and to reduce disease hazards, pests and odors. When water is used to clean the enclosure, nonhuman
primates must be removed unless the enclosure is large enough to ensure the animals will not be harmed, wetted or
distressed. Perches, bars and shelves must be kept clean. Correct by March 26, 2022.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The entire premises within the perimeter fence where the monkey buildings are located are in need of cleaning.
Accumulations of building materials, monkey enrichment items/toys, old nonworking equipment, waste/trash/broken toys
and discarded matter are present on the ground all around the monkey buildings and enclosures. Several items are
collecting rain water. These items may injure the animals if the wind blows them into the enclosures, interfere with
regularly husbandry/cleaning practices and provide breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests. Rodent holes
and ants were identified.
The premises where the housing facilities are located including buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept clean in
order to protect the nonhuman primates. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste and discarded
matter. Correct by April 30, 2022.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Evidence of both insect and mammalian pest issues were identified during this inspection. Ants were noted crawling on
the floor of the hallway of the inside portion of the sheltered housing building for capuchins. Rodent holes were noted on
the premises including under the outdoor portion flooring of the sheltered housing for both capuchin and owl monkeys.
Pests can spread disease, contaminate the animal areas and feed and negatively affect the well-being of the monkeys.
The facility shall establish and maintain a safe and effective program for control of insects, external parasites affecting
nonhuman primates, and birds and mammals that are pests. Correct by April 30, 2022.

This inspection was conducted with the licensee and his wife. The exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
