FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**The two enclosures that house the goats are constructed of a combination of wooden boards and wire mesh
fencing. In several of the areas the wooden boards are broken or have become rotted causing sharp edges and
exposing nails. There are also areas where the wire mesh fencing that is around the enclosure is not attached to the
wooden posts; the panels are tied together with binder twine. The panels were observed not to be secure with the
binder twine and there are wide gaps between the ends of the panels. Enclosures that are not properly maintained
could allow animals to escape or cause injury. Enclosures must be maintained so that they are structurally sound
and are free of sharp points, loose panels, and loose wire.
**The climbing structure that is in the larger of the two goat enclosures housing six goats was observed to have
several rotted boards, missing boards, and exposed nails on both of the ramps and the bridge connecting the two
ramps. Structures that are not properly maintained could cause injury to the animals. The climbing structure must be
maintained so that it is structurally sound and free of sharp points and missing boards.
