2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The Attending Veterinarian is not being given appropriate authority to ensure the well-being of animals at this facility. The
licensee employees a part-time Attending Veterinarian (AV) who has a written program of veterinary care (PVC). The
written PVC states that the licensee should be giving Frontline for control of ectoparasites. The attending veterinarian,
when contacted by phone, confirmed the use of Frontline and clarified it should be used during the summer months and
anytime issues are identified. The licensee stated that none of the animals are currently receiving Frontline because she
believed it stopped working. However, she did not address her concerns about Frontline with her AV prior to discontinuing
its use. During the inspection, inspectors saw a black and white colored female red fox scratching itself and a champagne
colored male fox biting at his front legs. When these behaviors were pointed out to the licensee, she indicated that they
were likely caused by fleas. She also stated that personal pets housed at the facility currently have fleas.
The attending veterinarian must be provided with adequate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care
and oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Failure to follow the direction of the attending
veterinary may lead to discomfort and unnecessary illness or suffering.
Correct by ensuring the Attending Veterinarian has appropriate authority and provisions are in place to provide adequate


veterinary care.

Time and method of identification.
The domestic cats maintained by the licensee do not have official identification as required by the Animal Welfare Act.
The licensee currently identifies 5 out of 6 adult domestic cats by name on the APHIS 7005 records, and none of the 6
adult cats have official USDA tags affixed to a collar or on their enclosure with a corresponding record book including
pictures. In addition, 1 out of the 4 adults housed outdoors is not currently identified on the APHIS 7005 records by any
form of identification.

Not having proper identification can cause misidentification of animals on inspections, veterinary care documentation,
acquisition and disposition records. In addition, it makes positive identification of medical treatment and sales impossible
to track.

The Licensee must ensure that an official USDA sequentially numbered tag is placed on the animal with a collar or kept
on the door of the animas cage or run, or an approved tattoo or microchip is used to positively identify the animals. In
addition, if tags are maintained on the enclosure (rather than a collar) then the licensee must also have a record book
containing each animal’s tag number, a written description of each animal, the information required by 2.75(a), and a clear
photograph of each animal. A duplicate tag must also accompany each cat whenever it leaves the premise.

2.75(a)(1)



Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Licensee is not keeping required acquisition and disposition records for the domestic cats. The Licensee is not
currently keeping an updated record of animals on hand (APHIS Form 7005) for any offspring born on the premise. During
inspection, a total of 10 kittens from 2 different litters are housed indoors with their queens. The licensee’s APHIS Form
7005 record on hand lists 5 adult cats and 0 kittens. In addition, the Licensee is not maintaining any disposition records
(APHIS Form 7006) for any adults or juvenile cats that are sold, transferred/exchanged or donated at this time. The
licensee confirmed that she fills out an APHIS Form 7006 during her sales but sends the only original copy with the new
owners.

Not having proper record keeping for the facilities does not allow for proper trace back of animals during a disease
outbreak and does not allow for proper accountability or identification of the animals during inspection.

The Licensee must ensure that she keeps and maintains records (including APHIS Form 7005 and APHIS Form 7006)
that fully and correctly disclose all information concerning each cat that has been purchased, or otherwise acquired,
owned, held or otherwise disposed of, in her possession or under her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or
otherwise disposed.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Licensee is not properly keeping acquisition and disposition records for the exotics/farm type animals. The Licensee
does not currently have a method in place for recording any acquisition of offspring born on the premise for these animals.


The records of animals on-hand does not match the current inventory at the facility. Specifically, 6 red foxes on hand with
4 red foxes on the inventory. In addition, the Licensee is not maintaining any disposition records for any adults or juvenile
animals that are sold, transferred/exchanged or donated at this time. The licensee confirmed that donated some red fox
pups from the last litter but did maintain disposition records. In addition, the licensee stated that all disposition records for
fox transfers are sent with the new owner.

Failure to maintain required records prevents trace back of animals during a disease outbreak and does not allow for
proper accountability or identification of the animals during inspection.

The Licensee must ensure that she keeps and maintains records that fully and correctly disclose all information
concerning each animal for which she has purchased, or otherwise acquired, owned, held or otherwise disposed of, in her
possession or under her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed.

Housing facilities, general.
The indoor facility has an excessive amount of clutter in the room and food/litter spilled on the floor. This portion of the
facility houses 2 of enclosures with 2 adult female domestic cats and 10 kittens. There are boxes and numerous other
items not used to facilitate husbandry of the animals stored in the room containing the animals.

Having excessive clutter prevents required cleaning and sanitation and spilled food within the facility can act as a food
source and nesting location for unwanted pests.



Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored
materials. Food, litter and materials used for maintaining, cleaning or care of the animals must be kept neat and tidy
within the facility.

3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The two outdoor enclosures, housing four adult domestic cats, are constructed with wood permeable to moisture and
cannot be properly cleaned or sanitized. One of the enclosures is constructed and framed with unsealed wood. The
enclosed shelter box, resting platform, and wooden ramp are also constructed out of unsealed wood. The second
enclosure with a corresponding shelter box and resting platform is constructed with a mixture of painted and unsealed
wood. Surfaces permeable to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and/or sanitized to meet the requirements set for by
3.11 of the AWA regulations. In addition, these structures and items are not designed or constructed in a way that they
can be easily removed once they become worn or soiled.

Having surfaces in contact with the animals that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can expose the cats to
unnecessary disease hazards.

The Licensee must ensure that all enclosures, den boxes and furniture type fixtures are designed and constructed of
materials that are impervious to moisture and able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they
become worn or soiled.

3.6(a)(2)(x)

Primary enclosures.
The outdoor enclosure housing two domestic cats (adjacent to the red fox enclosure) has flooring which does not protect
the animals’ feet and legs. The current design which includes wire overlaying dirt / compacted soil but includes significant
gaps between the wire and is unsafe and could easily lead to injury or entrapment. The licensee stated that this
enclosure was originally constructed with wire overlaying the ground to prevent escape. She stated that she planned to
bury the wire by adding additional soil, however, this was never completed. Instead, the cats have dug at the soil and
pulled at the wire causing several large areas where the wire is several inches above the soil. The wire has holes
approximately 2 inches wide by 3 inches long and these raised areas where the wire is no longer touching the dirt are as
large as 12 inches long by 6 inches wide. There are no litterboxes present in this enclosure which causes the cats to
continue to dig at the soil in attempts to bury their urine and feces. The size of these gaps is large enough to allow the
cats limbs to easily pass through the current condition is unsafe.

Exposed wire mesh with holes large enough for an animal’s extremities to go through are dangerous and can lead to
serious injuries, entrapment, and can cause discomfort when walking.
Correct by ensuring all floors are constructed and maintained in a manner that protect the cats’ feet and legs from injury.

3.6(b)(3)

Primary enclosures.


The outdoor domestic cat enclosures, housing a total of four adult domestic cats, do not have a litter box or other
designated receptacle for litter. The floor of both enclosures is comprised of dirt and a large amount of feces are present.
Lacking a litter box, the animals in these two enclosures urinate and defecate directly onto the soil. One enclosure has
exposed wire that appears to have been buried and dug up prior to the inspection, which impedes the removal of feces.

Receptacles containing clean litter are required for cats to engage in species-specific behaviors such as covering their
excreta and provide them the ability to avoid their own wastes. Failing to have receptacles for litter prevents appropriate
husbandry including removal of feces as often as necessary.

The Licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures containing cats have enough receptacles with sufficient clean litter
to contain excreta and body waste.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Enclosures for domestic cats are not being cleaned or sanitized often enough. The two outdoor enclosures housing two
domestic cats each are so contaminated with excreta that there is nowhere for the cats to go that is away from their feces.
The licensee stated that her current cleaning and sanitization protocol involves a “deep cleaning” of all indoor and outdoor
enclosures quarterly (every 3 months). Currently the licensee does not remove feces and food waste daily. Significant
accumulations of excreta are present as well as soiled bedding and other material in the outdoor enclosures housing adult
cats. The floor of these enclosures is comprised of dirt and there is no litterbox present, causing the cats to urinate and
defecate in the soil. Additionally, both outdoor enclosures contain a shelter box and resting platform containing old hay


that, according to the licensee, was added over the past winter. This hay appears dirty and soiled. In the cat enclosure
nearest the red foxes the food bowl is currently located on the raised platform and surrounded by dirty hay mixed with old
dry food and feces. There are also many small pieces of an old chewed Styrofoam box on the floor. According to the
licensee, the Styrofoam and hay bedding was placed in the enclosure during the winter for warmth.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from domestic cat enclosures daily and as often as necessary to prevent the
excessive accumulation of feces and food waste to reduce disease hazards, odors, and pests. Additionally, primary
enclosures and food / water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized by an approved method at least every two weeks
as required by section 3.11(b)(2). Infrequent cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures exposes the animals to
unnecessary disease hazards, odors, insects and pests.
Correct by removing excreta and food waste daily from primary enclosures and implementing a cleaning and sanitization
schedule in accordance with 3.11(b)(2).

Employees
There does not appear to be a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to carry out the level of husbandry
practices and care required by the AWA. There is one person solely responsible for the care of all 32 animals at this
facility. There are numerous non-compliances identified pertaining to the housing, cleaning, sanitation, record keeping,
and identification of domestic cats at this facility. Additionally, non-compliances for feeding, sanitation, drainage and
compatibility of other species were also identified at this facility. The licensee stated that she has significantly less time to
care for the animals due to schedule changes. The issues seen are consistent with shortages of personnel.
Insufficient personnel can lead to a failure in maintenance of the facility, delayed care of animals, and ultimately
unnecessary suffering.



The facility representative must ensure a sufficient number of adequately trained employees are utilized to maintain the
professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart and as required by section 3.132.

Feeding.
The dry food being offered to animals is not wholesome and palatable. The food bowls in both outdoor enclosures,
housing three fennec foxes and three red foxes, have large numbers of small black ants. The ants are in the bowl walking
on the dry kibble as well as forming trails leading to and from the food. The food receptacle for the Patagonian cavy
contains deteriorated/caked food at the bottom. The food is presented in a rubber-type feed pan that had tipped over at
the time of inspection. Large amounts of excreta are covering the majority of this enclosure, which caused the feed to
become contaminated with feces. The food receptacle for the three red foxes consists of small bucket suspended on the
enclosure. This receptacle is not being emptied and refilled, instead dry kibble is just added on top. There is feed dust as
well as deteriorated / caked food under the more recently added dry kibble. Additionally, this bucket has excessive rust
over nearly the entire interior surface (in contact with the food). The rust is to an extent that it can no longer be sanitized
effectively and could flake off into the feed. There are dry feces on top of the food in the silver and black fox enclosure.

Improperly cleaned receptacles can cause caking or contamination of the food, leading animals to consume less and/or
develop malnutrition and illnesses. Additionally, rusted food receptacles cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized.

Correct by ensuring all food receptacles are kept clean and sanitary at all times. In addition, adequate measures must be


taken to prevent molding, contamination, and deterioration or caking of food.
