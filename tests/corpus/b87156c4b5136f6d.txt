ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian has not made an inspection of this new site. Each site needs to have the attending
veterinarian make an initial inspection and at least an annual inspection each year there after. This assures that the
site meets the requirements agreed to in the program of veterinary care and that the attending veterinarian is
comfortable with the conditions and housing of all the animals at the site.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Rabbits housed outdoors did not have a roofed structure to protect them from inclement weather. Animals can
become wet and succumb to weather related illness if they do not have a shelter to get under. All animals housed
outdoors must have adequate shelter to protect them form inclement weather.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Four adult Cavies were in an approx. 6' x 6' enclosure. This space is too small for the four cavies and does not
allow each animal the ability to perform normal postural and social adjustments. These animals need to be moved
to a larger enclosure or the existing enclosure needs to be enlarged. Confining animals in too small of an enclosure
can cause stress and associated health problems. All animals at the facility need to have adequate space to
comply with USDA space regulations.
