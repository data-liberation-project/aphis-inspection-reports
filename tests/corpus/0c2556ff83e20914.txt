2.50(c)(2)(ii)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
At the time of inspection the licensee did not have a record book containing the required information for three
Bengal cats used for exhibition. Identification tags, written descriptions, and clear photographs of these animals
were not available. Appropriate identification of cats used in exhibition is necessary to ensure that animals have
been acquired legally and are able to be tracked to ensure humane care and use in regulated activities. A class "C"
exhibitor shall identify all cats under his or her control or on his or her premises, whether held, purchased, or
otherwise acquired with the required identification methods under this Section of the AWA regulations.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee acquired three Bengal cats in early March 2020. There were no Records of Acquisition (APHIS Form
7005) with the required information available at the time of inspection for these cats.
The acquisition form (APHIS 7005) is necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated
activities to ensure their humane care and use. Each dealer or exhibitor shall use the Record of Acquisition and
Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS 7005) and Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS 7006) to make, keep,
and maintain the required information.
