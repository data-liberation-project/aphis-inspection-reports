The use of expired medications is considered adulterated and is not an appropriate method to treat or control
diseases. Expired medications may be ineffective in treating disease or may turn toxic after the expiration date.
Expired medications cannot be given to any regulated mammal. Establish a system to ensure that expired
medications are not given to any mammal in the future.
