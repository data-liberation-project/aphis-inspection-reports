2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The current written program of veterinary care (3/16) has been signed by the attending veterinarian but has not
been signed by a representative of the facility. A signature represents an agreement to the formal arrangements
providing for regular veterinary care for the animals. The 2015 written program of veterinary care was also signed
by just the veterinarian.
*The current written program of veterinary care (3/16) needs more details. The facility has added the new lemurs to
the plan but has not addressed TB testing. The facility is currently administering Heartgard to the otters but the
parasite control section does not describe the regular use of this product. Lack of sufficient detail may lead to
confusion of care required by the attending veterinarian.
The formal arrangements between a consultant attending veterinarian and the exhibitor shall include a complete
written program of veterinary that includes all regular preventative care for all species at the facility and has been
agreed to by both the veterinarian and the facility. Correct by Nov. 14, 2016.
Inspection conducted with multiple facility/animal caretaker staff. Exit interview conducted with undersigned
Husbandry Registrar.
