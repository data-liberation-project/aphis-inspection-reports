Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
In late March 2022, one fox mother moved two fox kits out of the nest apart from their two siblings soon after having been
born. Licensee replaced the kits, only to have the mother remove them again. This was repeated for two days until the
two kits were found moribund and died despite resuscitation efforts. A veterinarian was not notified until after the kits had
passed. Additional life-saving information may have been provided had a veterinarian been contacted. Direct and
frequent communication with a veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The records are in disarray. The APHIS Forms 7019 do not include all of the required information such that it is
impossible to accurately determine when animals were born, died, or sold. For example, birth records do not indicate
when the animals were sold. Sale records do not indicate when the animals were born. It is impossible to trace an
animal from birth to disposition. Accurate records ensure traceability in the event of a disease outbreak. Licensee shall


make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information concerning all animals
purchased or acquired, owned, held, leased, or in their possession or under their control, or which is transported, sold,
euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by Licensee. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in
Licensee's possession or under their control.

Facilities, general.
Four den boxes are in disrepair. Gaps between walls and/or roofs are present exposing insulation. Gaps in some
instances create spaces large enough for significant drafts and/or inclement weather to enter the animal space. Animals,
especially the young and newborn, may be adversely affected by drafts and weather entering the den boxes. Housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals.

Watering.
One enclosure containing two foxes did not have water at the time of the inspection. It was a warm, humid day. The
foxes were without water for an unknown amount of time. When water was provided, the animals immediately drank for a
prolonged period of time. Without adequate water, animals may become stressed, perhaps even die. Potable water
must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals.
