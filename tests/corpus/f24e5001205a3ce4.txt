** An adult male tiger named “Waldo” appeared to have a noticeably thinner body condition since the last inspection
on 12/9/2015 his ribs were visible and hip bones were protruding. Waldo is being housed with another tiger and is
not being monitored to ensure he is getting his diet. Waldo has an abnormal gait affecting his right front leg which
was cited on the inspections conducted 9/9/2016 and 12/9/2016, A note made by the attending veterinarian on
11/17/2015 stated that it was a chronic limp and non-responsive to pain medications. Plan was to provide
glucoamine/chondroitin. There were no records available during this inspection showing that this animal is receiving
glucsamine/chondroitin, no monitoring the animal for change, and no plan to re-evaluate. Lameness and/or
abnormal gait may be indications of injury or underlying illness. Extremely thin body condition may indicate
underlying problems with nutrition or illness. This tiger needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to provide a plan for
diagnostics, treating and/or monitoring the condition.
**A male tiger named “ Toni” has an abnormal gait affecting his right front leg, which was cited on the inspections
conducted 9/9/2015 and 12/9/2015 When walking , his head bobs downward when placing his left front leg and
does not appear to bearing his full weight. A note made a veterinarian on 11/17/2015 on stated it was a chronic
limp, plan to provide glucosamine/chondroitin supplement. There were no records available during this inspection
showing that this animal is receiving glucosamine/chondroitin, no monitoring of the animal for changes, and no plan
to re-evaluate. Lameness and/or abnormal gait may be indications of injury or underlying illness. This tiger needs to
be re- evaluated by a veterinarian to provide a plan for treating and/or monitoring the condition.
**There were two tigers inside the enclosure housing three adult tigers named” Lazareth”, “Diablo” and “Twinkle”
that were observed fighting. Both tigers had open wounds, scratches along the shoulders and hindquarter. Staff
member accompanying the inspectors was unable to identify the two tigers. The wounds that are on the animals
can become infection and the fighting could potentially lead to the death of one of the tigers. A veterinarian needs to
evaluate these animals to determine if this is behavioral and provide a plan for treatment and monitoring for
resolution of this condition.
**An adult female tiger named “Spangles” was noted to be walking stiff, dragging leg on the right rear leg. This
condition had not been noted by any of the staff. No medical record available to indicate that the veterinarian hadbeen notified of this condition. Lameness may be an indication of injury or an underlying illness. This tiger needs to
be evaluated by a veterinarian to provide diagnostics, treating and/or monitoring the condition.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
**An adult female tiger named “Buffy” was noted to have fly strikes on both ears. Buffy has hair loss with redden
tissue. Fly strikes and redden tissue on the ears can lead to infection and possible necrosis of the tissues. This
tiger needs to be evaluated by the veterinarian to provide a plan on treating and monitoring this condition.
** In the dart gun case is an expired bottle of Xylazine (6/16/2016) and a Bottle of Ketamine (7/16/2016) that is
being utilized by the facility. In the veterinary clinic is an expired bottle of Calcionate Syrup, (12/2015) that according
to the staff member being given to a tiger cub named “Black Fire”. The use of expired drugs may not produce the
desired effect and may result in unnecessary pain or distress. Establish a program to monitor drugs for expiration

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility is allowing public to have direct contact with two 4 week old mountain lions without any means of
restraining the cubs during the photo shoots. Employee stated the cub is placed on the lap of the individual and a
baby bottle is fed to the cubs. The employee steps back to the camera and takes the photo while the other
employee stands behind the person taking the photo. There is a potential for the animals to become injured or the
animals injure the public during handling. These animals are out of the direct control of the trained handler during
these photo shoots. Ensure that during public contact there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public
safety and sufficient distance or barriers in place.

2.131(c)(3) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Two 4 week old mountain lions are being handled by the public during photo shoots. Employee stated that public
contact during photo shoots started with these two mountain lions at 3 weeks of age. At 3 week of age theseneonatal nondomestic cats are not able to thermoregulate and lack a fully functional immune system to fight off
disease and infection. Because of their limited immunity their health is at risk if they are exposed to other animals or
offered for public contact. Ensure that until these animals can thermoregulate and immunocompetent they are
housed in a control environment and handle these animals in a manner that does not expose them to any form of
public contact, to include public feeding.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The plan for the environmental enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of the nonhuman primates, 2
ring- tailed lemurs acquired in July 2014, was not available for review at the time of this inspection. The plan, at a
minimum, must address social grouping, environmental enrichment, special considerations, if applicable, and
restraint devices and their use. The plan and environmental enrichment must be approved by the attending
veterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to the animals on the environmental enhancement plan. There
was nothing documenting (i.e notebook, calendar) that enrichment is taking place. The animals have different items
in their enclosures, but there is no schedule of rotating or changing the items in the pens. Nonhuman primates have
complex social and intellectual needs that need to be addressed when in captivity. A written plan that is directed by
the AV, guided by current professional standards, and available for review by APHIS officials is required to ensure
that the psychological well-being of these animals is being appropriately addressed. Must develop, document, and
follow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement of nonhuman primates that is in accordance with
currently accepted professional standards and as directed by.

Inadequate protection from direct sunlight has the potential to cause eye damage and may affect an animal's ability
to thermoregulate without the ability to access shade. In addition, inadequate shade may restrict the animals from
utilizing the full enclosure space. Shelter from sunlight is required when overheating or discomfort of the animals is
likely.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelter structure in the outdoor enclosure #35 housing an adult leopard, Selbit, is not adequate to protect this
animal from the local area's climatic conditions (eg. rain, wind, snow, hail). This enclosure previously housed
bobcats, a much smaller animal than an adult leopard, and the shelter structure entrance is too small for a leopard
to enter this structure or to have adequate room to make normal postural adjustments if able to gain access.
Animals housed outdoors should have appropriate shelter, natural or artificial, where they can escape adverse
climatic conditions and stay warm and dry.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for
all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
**According to the diet plan observed by the inspectors it calls for “Added Calcium supplement for the cubs”. The
plan liss two calcium supplements to be give, Primal Cal 2 scoops of supplement per pound of meat and Calcium
Citrate 4 scoops of supplement per pound of meat. Presently, Primal Cal and one expired bottle of Calcionate Syrup
was found during the inspection. Lameness and joint swelling in young, growing cubs may be caused by inadequatecalcium in the diet and can lead to serious injury and health consequences. Ensure that the calcium supplements
are being given as directed by the AV
**The food and receptacle inside the enclosure housing two bears named “Cody” and “Pebbles” was not wholesome
or free from contamination. The receptacle had a black grime with caked food particles around the inside where the
food is coming into contact. The food inside the receptacles was rotting and had an excess amount of flies in and
around the food. This poses a risk to the animal’s health from bacteria growth and flies can transmit an infectious
organism to the food.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination, and the diet shall be prepared with
consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.

WATERING.
**The following enclosures had horse trough provided for the animals to soak and cool themselves in contained
brown to black or green water with noticeable hair, leaves, dirt and other debris. Several of the animals were
observed drinking from the water trough. These water troughs are not being kept clean and sanitary and pose a risk
to the animal's health should they choose to bathe or drink this water due to bacterial contamination.

**Excess building materials that is not being uitlized is being stored next to the enclosure housing two tigers, "Buffy,
"Spangles" and three bears near the side gate on north east side of the facility. The piles of excess building material
can harbor pests which pose a risk to the health and well-being of the animals.
**Stored on the top of a plastic carrier in the indoor enclosure housing two 4 week old mountain lion cubs named
"Louisa" and"Marissa" is a plastic container of wipes and 2 bottles of baby formula. In the veterinary clinic in the
enclosure housing one tiger cub named "black fire" sitting on the window sill is a plastic container of wipes. The
animals can gain access to these items, or fall and could pose a risk to the health and well-being of the animals by
ingesting these items. This was corrected during the time of inspection.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals and facilitate the prescibed
husbandry practices.

SANITATION.
Excess flies were noted throughout the outdoor facilities, particularly the bear enclosures, inside and outside the
commissary. The flies were numerous enough that the buzzing was audible while conducting the inspection. Fly
strips and containers with fly bait are being utilized, but are ineffective because they are either full of flies or
containers were empty except for dead flies and debris. Flies and other pests may carry and transmit diseases to
the animals and a more effective method of monitoring and preventing their presence in/around enclosures, food
storage/preparation should be implemented.
Establish and maintain a safe and an effective pest control program which should include reduction of flies,particularly around food and food preparation areas.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The licensee is not regularly involved in the day to day care of the animals and facilities. Facility staff stated that
they have 2 full time employees able to work directly with the animals and 2 other employees who are being
trained. The employees who are living on site have not been adequately trained for emergency situations. This was
evidenced by not being able to explain the protocol in an emergency or escaped animal. This facility currently has a
total of about 111 animal, including 12 different species. These species have complex medical, behavioral,
nutritutional and other husbandry needs. Conditions at the facility currently do not meet the professional level of
husbandry practicies described in the regulations and standards. Young animals at the facility were being hand
raised and require around the clock specialized care and feeding. A total of 32 enclosures, affecting 64,had no
shade. This has been an ongoing problem that has been cited since May 2009. At least 4 enclosures were in vary
degrees of disrepair that was cited on 12/9/2015 inspection. The excessive number of animal welfare concerns
indicates that there is not a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain a professionally
acceptable level of husbandry practices and lack in emergency procedures. Facilities are required to utilize a
sufficent number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professional husbandry standards described in
the regulations and standards to ensure that the animals are appropriately maintained, sanitary facilities and receive
appropriate monitoring, veterinary care, feeding and watering.
License must evaluate the current work load and staffing level to ensure that a sufficient number of adequately
trained employees are utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable leve of husbandry practices described in
the regulations and standards.
3.133 DIRECT
SEPARATION.
Two adult tigers were observed fighting in the enclosure housing three adult tigers named "Lazareth, "Diablo" and
"Twinkle". Staff member was unable to identify which two tigers were fighting and inspectors were told fighting only
occurs when they are being fed. No food was present at the time and both cats were observed multiple times
fighting with visable wound marks on shoulders and hindquarters. The continutally fighting could interfere with their
health, cause undue stress or potentially lead to the death of one of the tigers. This could possibly be a
behaviroral/dominace problem and should be observed, evaluated and recommendations being provided by a
veterinarian.

Animal housed in the same enclosure must be compatible.so it does not interfere with their health or causesdiscomfort or distress.
Ensure that all animals housed in the same enclosure are compatible.
