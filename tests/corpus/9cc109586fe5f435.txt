2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There were 6 dogs over 16 weeks of age that did not have any means of identification on the animals or enclosures
such as a collar and tag, tattoo, or microchip.
Lack of appropriate identification can result in a failure of animals to be tracked, maintained, and treated on an
individual basis and an inability to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, and healthcare
documentation.
A class A dealer (breeder) must identify all dogs on the premises by an official tag and collar, tattoo, or microchip.
