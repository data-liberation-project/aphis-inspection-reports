2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A pig in the domestic interactive area walked with an abnormal gate. It did not walk with a smooth motion, but
instead appeared to drag its hind limbs each time it stepped with either leg. The hooves on both front and hind legs
were excessively long, extending out three to four inches to the point that they were curling causing the toes to
rotate up and heel to drop. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could
be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must
ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
To be corrected by 11/11/16.

structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals,
and to restrict the entrance of other animals.
This was corrected during the inspection.
