ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee recently dismissed his attending veterinarian and plans to use one closer to his location however a
formal arrangement and program of veterinary care have not yet been completed with the new veterinarian.
Licensees with part time attending veterinarians must have a formal arrangement that includes a written program of
veterinary care from the veterinarian in order for USDA representatives to consider the facility to be receiving
adequate veterinary care. A program of veterinary care needs to be developed with the new attending veterinarian
that includes recommendations for regularly scheduled visits, deworming protocols, vaccination protocols, and any
other routine medical care the veterinarian feels appropriate for each species.
To be completed by: Sept 25, 2014

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The older camel and the reindeer do not have barriers in front of their stalls to prevent the public from having
physical contact with the animals. Currently the public can stick their arms through the wire almost to their elbows.
The camel and reindeer could injure a person from a bite or by trapping an arm through the wire.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public
with sufficient distance/barriers between the animals and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of the
animals and the public. Barriers adequate to prevent the general public from having direct contact with these
animals need to be installed. If barriers are not possible at their current location these animals need to be moved to
an area where contact with the general public is not possible.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Two camels and a reindeer are being kept in horse stalls with solid walls along the bottom 3 or 4 feet. The barn
these animals are in has open doors but very little natural air movement. The outside temperature at the time of the
inspection was approximately 94 F with a heat index of 99 F. There was a fan over the reindeer(cid:25)s stall however it
wasn(cid:25)t turned on at the time of this inspection. The reindeer was obviously uncomfortable based on his panting.
The licensee(cid:25)s employee commented that one of the camels liked to dump his water and lay in it. Both of these
behaviors are consistent with excessive heat exposure or stress.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal(cid:25)s health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken
to alleviate the impact of those conditions. A method for adequately cooling the enclosures for the 2 camels and 1
reindeer needs to be implemented whenever temperatures are causing these animals excessive discomfort. If
adequate cooling cannot be provided in their current housing then these animals need to be moved to housing that
can provide more comfortable temperatures for the animals.
To be completed immediately.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
