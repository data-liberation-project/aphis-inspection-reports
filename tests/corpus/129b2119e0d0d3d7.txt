CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Accumulations of feces, dirt, food waste and grime was seen on the floor, interior walls and in the dog door
entrances of 8 enclosures housing 22 dogs. A build up of dirt and grime was noticed along the lip of the water catch
buckets and there is a slick oily type material in the bottom of the bucket that the dogs have access to.
Accumulations like these indicate lack of cleaning, and can increase living and breeding grounds for pests, soil the
dogs, and enhance disease hazards by preventing proper sanitization to occur. Proper routine cleaning must be
done to prevent accumulations and to allow for complete and successful sanitiztion of surfaces using one of the
methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3). All surfaces must be maintained through a regular routine of cleaning and
to include sanitzing at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent accumulations and minimize
disease hazards.
