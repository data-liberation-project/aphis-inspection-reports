2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is still a bottle of injectable Telazol and a bottle of Zetamine (Ketamine) in the medication area of the storage
building. The licensee stated this medication is used to sedate the animals but had no documentation showing
written instructions from the attending veterinarian on its directions for appropriate use, the indications for its use, or
precautions needed to be taken during its use. The licensee must ensure that all medications are used in a manner
consistent with the provision of adequate veterinary care to protect the health of the animals and ensure drugs are
used in an appropriate manner. The licensee must obtain written approval from their attending or prescribing
veterinarian if they wish to continue to use Telazol and Zetamine to sedate animals. This documentation must
minimally contain information regarding exact indications and situations for use, dosing instructions for all specific
animals for which these drugs may be used (route, concentration, dose, etc.), and guidance regarding appropriate
monitoring and recovery of animals. All medications must be labeled and administered properly as part of the
facility's programs of adequate veterinary care.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The resting surfaces, climbing ladders, and some spots on the walls in two sheltered capuchin enclosures were
visibly soiled. The licensee states that these were last sprayed clean about 2 weeks ago. There was also an
accumulation of feces in the indoor section of another sheltered capuchin enclosure. The licensee states the feces
were last removed from this enclosure two days ago. Failure to clean hard surfaces with which nonhuman primate
come into contact can result in odors, attraction of pests, and general unsanitary conditions and can also play a
role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces that nonhuman primates come into
contact with are spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.84 of subpart F to prevent accumulation of
excreta or disease hazard. If species scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or replaced at regular intervals as
determined by the attending veterinarian in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry
practices. Correct by 3 December 2015
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL. The wooden lower front section of a shelter used for 2 addax has several sections missing. Some of these sections
are approximately 10(cid:29)X12(cid:29). In another enclosure housing 2 addax there is a section of fabric fence material that has
come loose from the wire enclosure fence. Housing enclosures that are not kept in good repair can result in injury
to the animals. All building materials must be constructed of materials that are structurally appropriate for the
animals and must be maintained and kept in good repair.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The area around the water receptacles for the zebras and for the deer has mud and standing water. These animals
cannot approach the water receptacles without walking through the mud and standing water. Standing water and
mud can also attract pests and can lead to an increase in disease transmission. A suitable method must be
established to rapidly eliminate excess water.
This routine inspection was conducted on 2 Dec. 2015 with facility representatives as well as Dr. Margaret Shaver,
VMO and Kendall Lundy, ACI.
The exit interview was conducted with a facility representative on 3 Dec. 2015.
