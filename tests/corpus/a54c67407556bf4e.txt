3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Bird droppings were observed next to a wall within one enclosure, as well as on the lids of feeding receptacles, and
toward the top of an inside wall and on an outside wall of an uncovered feeding receptacle in the long kennel building.
Rodent droppings were additionally observed in the south kennel building alongside an interior wall outside of the
enclosures. Birds and rodents can transmit diseases to the dogs and contaminate the areas. An effective pest control
program must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in animal areas.
