2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
One pig on an approved protocol had ulcerations of the skin along the dorsum of the animal with redness and
hyperpigmentation above and below the ulcerations. The facility representative stated the lesions developed in response
to thermal injury due to electric warmers used during surgery to support temperature regulation. The facility representative
stated to avoid direct contact, pads and blankets were used between the patient and the electric heating pad. A water
circulating heating pad was initially used but began to leak and was replaced with the electric heating pad. Once the skin
ulcerations were observed, the veterinary staff was notified, and the pig was treated and given supportive care. The
principal investigator has been advised by the veterinary staff to use water circulating heading pads on animals for heat
support. The use of an inappropriate heating source may result in unexpected pain and distress to the animals.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
To be corrected for all future inspections.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
