2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the refrigerator that contains medications for the dogs there is a bottle of Penicillin that expired in November 2007
and a bottle of Oxytocin that expired in September of 2013. The use of expired medical material is not considered
to be acceptable veterinary practice and is not consistent with adequate veterinary care required by regulations
under the Animal Welfare Act. Expired medications may lose their effectiveness causing the health of the dogs to
suffer. The license must either properly dispose of all expired medications or segregate them in an appropriately
labeled, physically separate location from non-expired medications. Licensee must ensure that all medications
used for the care of the dogs have not expired.
A male Shih Tzu (USDA tag# 10) was observed to have cloudy eyes. Closer examination revealed a brownish,
crusty material surrounding the upper and lower lids of both eyes. There was a small amount of liquid discharge
along the bottom of the right eye. The licensee thought that this dog was blind. This dog has not been evaluated
by a licensed veterinarian.
Poor eye health can cause pain and discomfort to the dog. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian
by end of business on August 27, 2015 for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment
plan must be documented and available to the inspector upon request.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
This inspection contained a follow-up of the male Maltese (USDA tag #35) that was cited on the previous inspection
report under 2.40 (b) (2) and dated March 26, 2015. This dog was no longer at the facility. The licensee said the
dog was given away to someone. The inspector asked for the name of the person the dog was given to and the
licensee did not know it. Accurate and appropriate documentation is essential for the tracking and identification of
each animal.
Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records for each dog that is owned, acquired or otherwise held. Theserecords must fully and accurately disclose the name and address of the person the dog was sold or given to.
Licensee must ensure that all records fully and completely maintain all required information.

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are four enclosures, containing ten dogs, which have a buildup of dirt and grime on their walls. The licensee
said that the dirt and grime are scrubbed off the walls every spring and fall. The buildup of dirt and grime can
increase the risk of health hazards towards the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all used primary enclosures
are sanitized once every two weeks, or more often if necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt, grime and any other
disease hazards.
