3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the building housing the adult dogs there were three enclosures housing three dogs with three food receptacles
with organic buildup. The two stainless steel bowls had a buildup of greasy brown sticky residue on interior sides
and bottoms, and the one plastic feeder had a buildup of food debris in the bottom, in addition to the greasy buildup.
The licensee stated that the bowls get washed approximately once a month.
The accumulation of dirt, debris, and food waste can cause disease. The licensee must sanitize all used primary
enclosures and food receptacles at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph
(b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta
and other disease hazards.
