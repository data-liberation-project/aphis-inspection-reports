The following dogs were found to require veterinary care
A two year old female miniature schnauzer ( ID # 003 795 863 ) whose bottom jaw appears longer than the top jaw
has a firm, thick material encasing nearly the entire surface of part of the upper and lower front teeth and nearly all
of the upper and lower cheek teeth. The gums appear somewhat swollen and red.
A female shih tzu ( ID # 003 546 354 ) has a slight amount of clear fluid discharge from the right eye and the blood
vessels in the white of the eye appear slightly enlarged. There is a dull white color to approximately the top one third
of the area of the surface of the normally clear center portion of the right eyeball.
The licensee must have these dogs examined by a licensed veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented in writing and provided to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals are provided adequate veterinary care at all
times.
