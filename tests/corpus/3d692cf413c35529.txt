3.56(b)(1)
SANITATION.
*** The rabbits in the contact area are housed directly on concrete in a stall during the warmer months. The
concrete is no longer sealed and impervious to moisture. This does not allow the enclosure to be effectively cleaned
and sanitized every 30 days as required. The floor should be made impervious to moisture to facilitate cleaning of
these enclosures.
