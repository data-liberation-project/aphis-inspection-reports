2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee is missing address information for the buyers of three foxes and one mink. The foxes were sold on
8/13/17, 8/19/17, and 9/20/17. The mink was sold on 7/8/17. The buyer's name was documented, but the
addresses for those animals was absent. Not documenting all of the required information does not allow for proper
tracking of the animals by an APHIS official. Addresses or at the very least license plate numbers of the buyers
must be documented for all sales.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure for the foxes is not completely enclosed by a perimeter fence. One section has about four feet where
the fencing for the enclosure is not enclosed by the perimeter fence. Another section has the perimeter fence only a
few inches away from the primary enclosure. Not having the perimeter fence completely enclose the primary
enclosures with at least three feet between the primary enclosures and the perimeter fences doesn't ensure that the
animals contained within their enclosures can't escape from the perimeter fence if they somehow escaped from
their primary enclosures.
No regulated activities may take place at the new site until it has passed inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
