FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The Rhino barn, housing one (1) Rhino, has several stand alone posts. These post go from the ground to the roof
of the open front barn, serving as the structural stabilizers for the front of the barn. Several of these post have been
chewed and rubbed by the Rhino to the point of being almost chewed in half. This is weakening the structural
strength of the posts creating an unsafe environment for the Rhino. The outdoor housing facilities shall be
structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the drive through park, where the water buffalo are located next to the dam, there is a drainage hole in the
ground. It is about 2 to 3 feet in depth and does not have a cover or barrier around it to prevent animal access. The
sides of the hole are steep which would hinder a juvenile animal from being able to climb out. It also has a large
metal drain pipe sticking out of the dirt that is rusty with sharp edges exposed. The location of the hole was marked
by a piece of white PVC pipe that has fallen into the drain hole. Should a juvenile or small animal fall into the large
hole, or a larger animal stumble on it they could potentially become injured from the fall, or become injured by the
metal pipe edges. Any man made structure, or situation created, within the animal areas, shall be made safe to
protect the welfare of the animals exposed.
The entire surface area of the small pen attached to the left side of the main enclosure for the lions has standing
water and mud. This pen is lower then the other attached enclosures which allows the run-off water from the other
enclosures to flow into it. There are no drainage pipes and the water is unable to drain freely from the sides
resulting in standing water and mud. Poor drainage can lead to an increase in disease hazards, poor pest control
and cause contamination of animals exposed to it, resulting in illness. Adequate drainage shall be provided to allow
rapid removal of excess water and prevent accumulations thereby protecting the lions from disease hazard and
contamination.
The dirt and sparsely grassed enclosure containing two (2) Tigers appears to be holding moisture in the front of andaround the pool area. The ground is very wet an appears to have algae growing on the surface. Poor drainage, and
the exposure to the constant dampness, can result in the animals becoming ill. Adequate drainage must be
provided to maintain safe, dry areas for the animals and to prevent disease and illness.
