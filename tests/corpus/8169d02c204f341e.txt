ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Boxer ("Nellie", tag #122) appears extremely emaciated and her flanks are sunken behind her rib cage.
Physical inspection of the dog revealed there is very little fat covering her body frame. Her shoulders, back bone,
ribs and hip bones were easily felt and her ribs were clearly visible beneath her hair coat. This dog has a litter of 8
two week old puppies that she is nursing. The licensee stated that he has not consulted with a veterinarian about
this dog(cid:25)s condition but has increased her food rations. An emaciated body condition could be an indication of an
underlying health condition and if left untreated could be detrimental to the dog.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis of her condition and to develop an
effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

A bottle of expired Vetericyn pink eye spray was found in the medicine cabinet within the dog kennel. The Vetericyn
had expired February 2015 and the licensee stated that it had been recently used to treat a dog. Expired
medication may lose their effectiveness and the health of the dog could suffer.
The use of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be
acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The licensee must either dispose
of the expired Vetericyn, remove it to a location separate from the current medications or appropriately label the
Vetericyn that it is expired and not to be used on the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all medical material used
for the dogs is current and has not expired.
To be corrected by: The licensee removed the expired Vetericyn at the time of the inspection.
