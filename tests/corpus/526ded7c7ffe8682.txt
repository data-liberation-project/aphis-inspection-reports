3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the sheltered building there are four enclosures with painted wood supports in one corner that are
excessively chewed and roughened and exposes the underlying bare wood. There is also one enclosure with
plastic paneling covering one wall that has been chewed and has a large portion torn away that also exposes the
underlying wood. One plastic feed bowl is also excessively chewed to the point there is a hole in it.
Chewed, roughened surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized to prevent disease hazards, and bare
wooden surfaces are no longer impervious to moisture.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis. All surfaces that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized must be repaired or replaced when worn or soiled.
To be corrected by August 28, 2015
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the sheltered building a majority of the enclosure walls have brown colored grime covering at least thirty
percent of the surfaces.
Dirty, grimy surfaces can cause disease hazards.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and
sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b) of this subpart to prevent an accumulation of excreta and reduce disease
hazards.
To be corrected from this day forwardThis was a kennel inspection only, as the licensee was unavailable. A records inspection will be conducted at a
later time.
Inspection and exit interview conducted by Lynn Clarke with facility representative.
