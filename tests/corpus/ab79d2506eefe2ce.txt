2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Facility permits public feeding of lions through a clear sheet of plexi-glass approximately 3ft.X4ft in size with a 2inch
X 2inch hole (the same size as the cyclone wire fencing holes) cut in the center panel. The panel is hung on small
hooks on the outside of the cyclone fencing. The keeper stated that thawed meat is rolled into a tube-shape and
the customer is instructed to push the meat with a flattened hand to the lion through the opening in the plexi-glass
cutout. The keeper also stated that the public may experience a brief moment where the lion(cid:25)s tongue may come in
contact with the palm of the hand of the feeder. This public feeding activity may allow for brief contact with the lion(cid:25)s
tongue and poses the risk of the public potentially extending a finger past the plane of the lion(cid:25)s primary enclosure
fence. Sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the public so as to assure the safety of the
animals and the public must be in place.
Correct for all future inspections.
