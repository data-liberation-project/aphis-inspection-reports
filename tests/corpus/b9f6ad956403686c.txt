2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At a public petting zoo event held outdoors at a public library there were 5 collapsible play pens set up under a very
large shade tree on grass. 3 pens contained regulated species: a single rabbit, two guinea pigs, and a mini-pig.
There were also 3 goats staked and tethered with a leash and collar under the shade tree. The event began as
scheduled at 11am and approximately 27 children were present with approximately 10 adults at this time. Only one
attendant was available and she was still busy setting up the animals. During this period of time the inspector
observed two different children using sticks to poke the rabbit and the guinea pigs, one adult picking up a guinea pig
and holding to her face to be photographed, and children using too much force when petting the animals. The
attendant was not present to observe these events as she was back and forth to her vehicle collecting supplies.
Once the animals were completely set up the attendant was continually present within the area however she was
also displaying a snake and so frequently was unable to adequately visualize or hear what was occurring in all of
the animal pens. The attendant was notified by a child that a goat had tangled its leg in its leash and that one goat
had pulled out its stake. During the course of an hour the inspector counted two additional groups of children, 17
and 27, with approximately 15 adults, coming to visit the petting zoo. This is a substantial number of people for one
attendant to adequately oversee to ensure animals are handled carefully. An appropriate number of facility
attendants must be present at all times during periods of public contact to ensure the safety and behavioral
well-being of the animals.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection was conducted with the facility representative at the Blyden Branch Library in Norfolk, VA.
The exit interview was conducted with the licensee by phone.
