FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following structural concerns were identified in the enclosures containing cattle at the farm:
*P1 - One shelter's back wall contained exposed hardware cloth with sharp points at approximately 6" off the
ground. Sharp metal points can cause injury to the animals.
*P2 - There was an approximately 30" wide by 10-12" high gap between the fence and the ground. This fence
section bordered unfenced fields adjacent to the enclosure.
*P5 - Sections of the chain link fence along the front of the enclosure were unsteady and there was an
approximately 30" wide by 10" high gap between the bottom of the fence and the ground.
Per this section of the regulations, outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and prevent entry by unauthorized people or
animals.
Although several areas of the fence were already under repair prior to the conclusion of this portion of the
inspection, all items must be corrected January 15, 2018.
This inspection (Nov 30 - Dec 1, 2017) and exit interview (Dec 1, 2017) were conducted with facility representatives.
