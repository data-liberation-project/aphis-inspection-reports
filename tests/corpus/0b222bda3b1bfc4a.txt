3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
Licensee is using Clorox to disinfect guinea pig enclosures, but is not using a detergent solution first to remove
organic material and residue. Lack of an effective sanitation program exposes the animals to potential disease
hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks or as necessary with proper agents to sufficiently clean and disinfect all surfaces that the guinea pigs may
come in contact. Licensee must follow one of the three methods described in section 3.31(a)(4) to ensure that
enclosures are adequately sanitized to minimize the risks of disease to the animals housed therein. Correct by
ensuring a sanitation program is put into effect. Correct by October 31, 2015.
