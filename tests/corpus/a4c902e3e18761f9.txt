3.75(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
The langur primary enclosure contained multiple rusty drains. Rust can prevent proper sanitization of surfaces and lead to
build-up of excreta and food materials. The sifaka enclosure has flaking baseboards. All surfaces that come in contact
with nonhuman primates should be free of excessive rust to maintain structural integrity of the surface. Surfaces should
also be free of jagged edges to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 01/04/2023.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Several enclosures had various forms of disrepair. The red panda and snow leopard enclosures contained flaking paint.
The kudu enclosure had metal mesh with sharp points. Damaged primary enclosures can present various hazards to the
animals contained within them. All enclosures should be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
