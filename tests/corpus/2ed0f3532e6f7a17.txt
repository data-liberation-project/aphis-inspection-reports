2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Santa Cruz ram was observed to be limping during inspection. We closely observed him to be walking and
eating and found him to be bright and alert but that a portion of his left hind leg was missing. The area where the
leg would be was covered with wool so outward signs of infection or any existing wound could not be ascertained
from the distance during inspection. The licensee reported that all hooves of the herd were trimmed this past
November or December and that all sheep's legs were fine then, but that they were not aware that this sheep had
lost a portion of its leg sometime between then and today. Adequate daily observations are needed to recognize
animal injuries such as this so that the problem could have been communicated to the attending veterinarian in a
timely manner.
Non-critical:
-An opossum's lower right gum line had a lesion. The licensee wasn't aware of this particular wound but reported
that it had been fighting with it's cagemate a while back. The wound is scabbed over and an area under two teeth in
the same area is pale in color. Observation reveals this wound is deeper than just a scratch and needs to be
reported to the attending veterinarian so that a treatment plan can be developed.
Note: The licensee called the attending veterinarian prior to the exit interview.
Develop and maintain routine daily observations so that health conditions can be communicated to the attending
veterinarian in a timely manner.
Correct from this day forward.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
In the Santa Cruz sheep enclosure, there is a large build up of soiled material along the back fence. The soiled
material has partially buried a metal hay feeder and the back fence. The top of soiled material is approximately twofeet from the top of the fence. The animals could potentially escape from the enclosure at this area of the fence.
Additionally, soiled material can attract pests and vermin.
Remove the soiled material and repeat often enough to prevent excessive build up.
