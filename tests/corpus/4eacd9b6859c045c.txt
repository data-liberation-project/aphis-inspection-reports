INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A macaque was found to have necrotic lesions at three of six subcutaneous injection sites of an experimental
substance. The facility(cid:25)'s follow-up to this incident determined that the animal received a series of six subcutaneous
injections instead of a single intramuscular injection as was described in the approved protocol. An additional
departure from the approved protocol was that the injection sites were not shaved. Shaving the area was to allow
observation of the site post-injection.
The protocol also states that the clinical veterinary staff was to be notified when the injections were given and the
IACUC was to be notified regarding the results of the study at 72 hours post-injection. A facility representative
stated that the veterinary staff was not notified until 3-4 days post-injection and the IACUC was not notified until four
days post-injection.
This incident resulted in injury to the animal and delay in evaluation and treatment.
The facility must ensure that from this day forward all significant changes to protocols are reviewed and approved
by the IACUC prior to implementation by the Principal Investigator and research staff.
Correction date: The facility corrected the NCI prior to the time of inspection by retraining all personnel involved in
the incident on the importance of following a protocol exactly, as well as on the chain of communication for working
within and between departments to ensure all experimental procedures are conducted according to approved
protocols.
This adverse event was self-reported to OLAW.
A high incidence of alopecia was reported on a previous inspection report. The facility's alopecia incidence was
reviewed as well as supporting documentation regarding their extremely comprehensive investigation into potential
causes and, therefore, remedies for the cases of alopecia at the facility.

The inspection was conducted on March 24-26, 2015, accompanied by facility representatives.
The exit briefing was conducted on March 26 with facility representatives.Additional Inspectors
