ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 6 year old bobcat "Sissy" went into labor in April 2015. One female cub was born; however the second cub was
observed stuck in the birth canal. According to the licensee, the paws were visible in the birth canal but after 2 days
there was no further effort to expel the cub. The licensee darted "Sissy" with ketamine twice and hand injected the
bobcat one final time before she was able to get close to the bobcat. The licensee pulled the dead male cub the rest
of the way out of the birth canal and observed it was quite large. No attempts were made to contact the veterinarian.
The licensee noted it was the weekend and even if she had called the vet and managed to get through to someone,
it was unlikely the veterinarian would have come out.
Not calling or contacting the attending veterinarian put the mother's and cubs' lives at risk and caused unnecessary
suffering to the mother. There is potential that the male cub could have been saved if intervention had occurred
early, when it was first noted the mother was not progressing in labor. Without the benefit of veterinary care,
complications arising from the difficult birth could have caused infection and death to the mother.
Ensure the veterinarian is contacted in all medical conditions pertaining to the bobcat(s) so that appropriate
methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Additionally, ensure that a
veterinarian is available for emergency, weekend and holiday care as described in the regulations. All veterinary
medical documentation shall be maintained and available to APHIS officials upon request.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Three bobcats being housed in an enclosure identified with a green metal frame and located outside the main
housing units is constructed of wire cages supported by metal tubing. The metal tubing runs along the bottom front;
in three different spots the tubing has completely rusted through, leaving a gap in the support approximately four
inches wide each, weakening the supporting structure. In the main housing unit, on the very northwest cage housing a bobcat, the wire feed portal is rusted through
exposing jagged edges and allowing an opening of approximately three inches in circumference. This could easily
allow for the paw and/or a face to protrude and become injured.
A program of maintenance must be implemented to quickly identify and correct maintenance issues on a routine
basis; to provide structurally sound enclosures, to keep the facility maintained in good repair and to protect the
animals from injury. Steps must be taken to ensure these items do not repeat.

FEEDING.
In the food preparation area, a knife used to cut meat for the bobcats, was observed to have old and fresh dried
meat pieces left on its blade and handle.
Outside the food preparation doorway, is a table where the meat grinder's internal mixing parts are laid out. This
table has feathers and white flakes mixed in around the grinder parts, consistent with the owner's free ranging
chickens.
A method of cleaning and providing a sanitary environment for the food preparation equipment is required to reduce
disease and bacterial contamination on all food equipment. The food preparation equipment must be kept clean and
sanitary to maintain all animals in good health. Steps must be taken to ensure these items do not repeat.

SANITATION.
All of the pens housing the bobcats and the lynx have a putty like brown and black buildup of old and recent urine,
scent marking, food waste, hair and debris. This buildup of debris is thicker along each of the pen's bottoms and
corners.
A method of routine cleaning must be scheduled as often as necessary to clean this substance from the enclosures
in order to prevent contamination of the animals and to reduce disease hazards. Steps must be taken to ensure this
item does not repeat.To be corrected by: December 4, 2015
