ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult black female pug with no microchip number has an abnormal left eye. The left eye has a protruding
"bubble-like" bulge in the center on the eye. According to the licensee the attending veterinarian has evaluated and
provided a treatment plan in the past. It was unclear at the time of inspection how long ago the treatment was
administered. The licensee found an expired medication bottle containing a mixture of a steroid and antibiotic
solution from 2011 that was used for treating the eye after it was evaluated by the veterinarian. The inspector called
the attending veterinarian for additional information. The veterinarian stated it had been awhile since she had
examined the eye on this dog. The veterinarian also stated she recommended the dog be seen and a treatment
plan be administered. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, trauma, etc and can
be painful. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian an appropriate treatment plan administered.
Documentation should be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must
be part of this documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all
times.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There is a black adult female pug that does not have an official form of identification. The owner stated that they use
microchips as a form of identification. Upon inspection of the Dogs on Hand record 7005, a microchip number was
not listed with the dog on record. The inspector requested the owner scan the dog with a scanner device. No
microchip was found. Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with
certainty and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are officially identified by
collar, tattoo or microchip.
