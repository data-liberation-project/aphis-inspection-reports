2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
During the inspection the licensee did not have any APHIS form 7006s documenting the disposition of puppies being sold
since the last inspection. Failure to provide the disposition information interferes with the ability of APHIS officials to
identify dogs and trace their movements. Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records documenting the
disposition of all dogs and puppies that are sold.
