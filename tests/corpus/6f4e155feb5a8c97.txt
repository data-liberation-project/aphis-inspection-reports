FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**There was a missing horizontal board in a small section of the fence for the alpaca enclosure. This produced a
2-2.5 ft gap which could be large enough to allow an animal to escape. Sections of the fencing were also leaning
(around a 20-30 degree angle towards the ground) which could compromise structural strength.
As animals that escape an enclosure may become injured or cause injury to other animals, outdoor housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect and contain the animals.
