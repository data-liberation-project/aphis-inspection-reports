Housing facilities, general.
In the kitchen food preparation area, there is a refrigerator/freezer unit used to keep food for non-human primates (two
marmosets, one capuchin, one African green monkey and three lemurs). The unit contains a plastic bag of moldy
cherries that is leaking dark fluid onto the inside of the refrigerator. Other food is uncovered and/or not stored in
leakproof containers. The inside of the refrigerator and freezer have a dried material and food debris in numerous places.
The refrigerator does not radiate cold as expected when the door is opened. Storing food in unsanitary locations
compromises the palatability, quality and nutritive value which can lead to animal illness.
Supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage or contamination, and food requiring
refrigeration must be stored accordingly and in a manner that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive
value. When not in actual use, open food must be kept in leakproof containers.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the enclosure of the three lemurs there is a plastic trash bag in the rubber tire which is used as an enrichment item. In
the enclosure of the one African green monkey there is a plastic bag in the corner. The facility representative mentioned


these items are likely blown into the enclosures from the parking lot. Trash and debris in enclosures can cause
entrapment or injury to the animals if ingested.
Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in
good repair in order to protect the nonhuman primates from injury and to facilitate the husbandry practices required in the
regulations.

Facilities, general.
***In the kitchen food preparation area, there is a refrigerator/freezer unit used to keep some of the food for all of the
animals at the facility. The unit contains a plastic bag of moldy cherries that is leaking dark fluid onto the interior door
shelf of the refrigerator. Other food is uncovered and/or not stored in leakproof containers. The inside of the refrigerator
and freezer have dried material and food debris in numerous places. The refrigerator does not radiate cold as expected
when the door is opened.
***In the kitchen food preparation area, there are bags of potatoes used to feed animals stored on shelving alongside
cleaning products containing bleach and other chemicals.
Storing food in unsanitary locations compromises the palatability, quality and nutritive value. Storing food in close
proximity to chemicals can contaminate the food. Inappropriate storage can contaminate or spoil food, which can lead to
animal illness.
Supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage or contamination, and food requiring
refrigeration must be stored accordingly and in a manner that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive
value. When not in actual use, open food must be kept in leakproof containers. Chemicals must be stored away from


food and food preparation surfaces.

Feeding.
In an enclosure housing two camels, one zebra, one zedonk and one llama there is a large metal food trough with
produce to feed the animals. The food trough is dirty with caked on decomposing food from previous feedings. There is
also an accumulation of flies on the food and swarming above the trough.

Food receptacles should be kept clean and sanitary at all times to maintain the health and well-being of the animals and
prevent harboring of insects. Adequate measures should be in place to prevent molding, contamination, and deterioration
or caking of food.

Sanitation.
***In an untidy storage shed containing grass hay used to feed two camels, one zebra, one zedonk and one llama, there
is an accumulation of trash (empty chemical containers, cardboard boxes, empty bags and an open trash can with
miscellaneous trash) in the corner on the floor, a few inches from the bales of hay and the entire floor is covered in
several inches of old, loose hay.

***In an enclosure housing two camels, one zebra, one zedonk and one llama there is a broken portion of a fence that
was no longer in use and laying on the ground on the right side. This is a hazard since the animals can come into contact


with it and it can cause injury. Premises shall be kept clean and free of debris that have sharp points and protruding
edges in order to protect the animals from injury.

***In the two enclosures of one coati and one grey fox there are pieces of plastic and paper trash debris. The facility
representative mentioned trash items are likely blown into the enclosures from the parking lot. Trash and debris in
enclosures can cause entrapment or injury to the animals if ingested.

A system of facility monitoring should be in place and to ensure all enclosures are in good repair and accumulations of
trash and/or debris shall be in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
Accumulation of trash, debris and unnecessary items creates places for vermin and pests, which can contaminate food.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in the
regulations; trash and debris should not accumulate near food.
