CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The majority of the floor of the sheltered portion of one enclosure of the long kennel building housing 3 adult dogs is
covered with feces. The three dogs in this enclosure cannot access the sheltered portion of their enclosure without
coming into contact with the feces-contaminated floor . Excessive feces can soil the dogs, spread diseases and can
prevent a clean surface on which the dogs can walk and lie down. Feces must be removed at least on a daily basis
or more often to prevent the soiling of the dogs. Correct by close of business today.

Rodent droppings were observed on the concrete ledge in the indoor portion of the long sheltered building.
Rodents can transmit diseases to the dogs and contaminate the dogs' areas. An effective rodent control program
must be established and maintained so rodents are controlled. Correct by 18 March 2019.
