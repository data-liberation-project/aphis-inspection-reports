Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Upon IACUC investigation of the injured pig incident, they determined that the laboratory staff did not provide the
analgesia to pigs as prescribed by the protocol. According to the laboratory technician, recovery from anesthesia was
better for pigs without the use on analgesia. The Principal Investigator had not submitted an amendment to the IACUC
for this change in procedures and did not consult the Veterinary Staff.
Proposed activities and proposed significant changes in ongoing activities that have been approved by the IACUC may be
subject to further review and approval. Any changes in activity that involves the care and use of animals must be
approved by the IACUC.
This has been corrected by the IACUC through a corrective action and retraining of laboratory personnel.

Personnel qualifications.
The IACUC protocol PRA after an investigation revealed that 50% of the cranial implants performed by the principal
investigator had a negative outcome resulting in euthanasia due to infection from environmental contaminates. Three
Rhesus macaques had surgical implants performed by the principal investigator and the surgical sites subsequently
became infected despite daily cleaning of the site post-operatively. Samples of the implants and margins were taken, and


laboratory results revealed various environmental contaminates. Other study animals that had established head implants
also had a history of chronic implant infections.
Upon further investigation by the IACUC and veterinary staff, it was determined that there was a consistent break in
aseptic technique when the surgeries were being performed. The principal investigator had an improper understanding of
how to maintain a sterile surgical field. This resulted in chronic antibiotic resistant infections of the surgical sites and
significant neurological symptoms that required the animals to be euthanized.
The research facility did not have appropriate procedures in place to ensure the principal investigator was adequately
trained in aseptic surgical methods and procedures. The research facility must conduct training and reviews that provides
guidance that will ensure all person conducting surgeries are able to appropriately perform aseptic technique.
The facility implemented an appropriate corrective action plan that included training of all study personnel on aseptic
techniques and suspending surgical privileges until demonstrated ability to perform such procedures.



During the inspection of the Traylor Laboratory, expired compounds were noted. The compounds identified were
approved for use in the protocol, but they were expired. There were two bottles of Heparin that expired in 2017 and 2018
in a container on the workbench. There were also two bags sodium chloride on the workbench that expired in 2019. The
lab technician voluntarily informed the inspector that the Heparin and the sodium chloride were currently being used for
the two study rabbits in the laboratory.
The use of expired compounds several years out of date should not be used. All expired drugs shall be discarded or
marked 'expired' and stored separately from in date drugs. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure all


scientist, research technicians, animal technicians and other personnel involved in animal care are qualified to perform
their duties. The research facility must conduct training and reviews that provides guidance that will ensure all person are
able to appropriately use study compounds.

Miscellaneous.
On March 3rd, 2021 a pig was used in a cardiac study procedure. The pig’s recovery from anesthesia was monitor by two
laboratory technicians and a post-doctoral fellow. According to the laboratory technician, the anesthesia recovery was
difficult. The animal was checked on by the Principal Investigator multiple times. The pig was transported from recovery
to its home enclosure at 8:15pm by the Senior Lab Technician. The pig was checked on by the Senior Laboratory
Technician at 12:00am.
On March 4th, 2021, the pig was identified as injured during routine observations performed daily by the Research Animal
Resource Veterinary Staff. The pig was not able to stand on its own. The pig was immediately euthanized by Veterinary
Staff and a necropsy was performed. The necropsy identified the pig sustained two broken elbows.
The IACUC completed an investigation with the Principal Investigator and laboratory technicians. According to the Senior
Laboratory Technician, the pig injured itself when transitioning from the transport cage to the home enclosure. The Senior
Laboratory Technician decided to leave the pig after injury was sustained without communicating any of the concerns of
animal health to the Veterinary Staff.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma
or physical harm.
This has been corrected by the IACUC suspending the protocol and a corrective action plan.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
