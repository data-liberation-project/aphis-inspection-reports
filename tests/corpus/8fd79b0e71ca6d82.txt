ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the kennel there are two bottles of Specto-Gard that is labeled for use in pigs. The licensee stated she uses it on
the puppies when they have loose stool.
This drug is not labeled for use in dogs, and the licensee did not have the dosing instructions from a veterinarian
concerning the safe use of this medication in dogs. There must be a clear understanding between the attending
veterinarian and the licensee about the medications that are being used in the facility to ensure they are being
utilized correctly.
The licensee must obtain dosing instructions from a veterinarian for all medications utilized in the kennel that are not
labeled for use in dogs, to ensure that the medications are dosed safely and to protect the health of the animals.
To be corrected by July 31, 2014.
The exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
