INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In the most recent semiannual evaluation by the IACUC, minor facility deficiencies are noted; however, the report
does not contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.
Completion of this report allows for IACUC oversight and planning to ensure the health, safety and humane care
and use of the animals utilized at the facility.
Correct from this time forward.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In room 5, the woodchuck floor pens have rust present at the base of the galvanized steel sides. Rusted surfaces
are difficult to properly clean and sanitize, and rust can compromise the strength of the metal surfaces. The facility
has an appropriate plan to address this issue.
