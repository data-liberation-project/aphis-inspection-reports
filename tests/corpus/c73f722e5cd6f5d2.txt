2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An expired bottle of sterile water for injection and an expired bottle of Cydectin Pour-On are in the zoo barn
pharmacy and stored with medications available for current use. The use of expired medications is not considered
an appropriate method to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Expired medications may have
lower efficacy or become contaminated, and therefore using expired medications may be ineffective or unsafe in the
treatment or prevention of disease and injury. The licensee must ensure that all medications used on regulated
animals are within expiration dates.
