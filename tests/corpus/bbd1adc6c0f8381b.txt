Facilities, general.
The panels used as walls for the enclosure housing the oryx were not adequately secured, creating an enclosure that was
not structurally sound, which may allow the oryx to become injured should they fall. The enclosures must be constructed
of appropriate materials and strength for the animals housed within.
