ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog #319 (female poodle) received a C-section on 4-14-2014. This dog was noticed to be wobbly when moving
around and appears to be weak and lethargic. License's wife stated that she has tried several different vitamins
and foods to encourage the dog to eat and become stronger. However; it has been 10 days since the C-section
and the dog has had no signs of improvement. Licensee must have methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat
all health issues to ensure the health and wellbeing of the animals. This dog must be seen by a licensed
veterinarian. Documentation of examination, diagnosis and treatment must be maintained and made available for
further inspection.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog #319 (Female poodle) was noticed, by the Licensee's wife, to be weak after receiving a C-section on
4-14-2014. Although the facility has tried several foods and vitamins to strengthen the dog, the attending
veterinarian has yet to be consulted on the dogs' condition. Not having frequent communication with the attending
veterinarian can cause this dog unnecessary pain and discomfort. Licensee must have frequent communication
with the attending veterinarian for all health issues that are observed within a timely manner.
Correct By: From this day forward
Inspection and Exit conducted with Licensee's Wife.
