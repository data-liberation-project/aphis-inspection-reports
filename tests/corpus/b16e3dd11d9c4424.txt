FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some areas in enclosures had sharp/rough edges and loose wire that are in need of repair:
-The southeast corner of the fallow deer shed has a hole in it with rough sheet metal exposed to the deer.
-The shed entry for the brown swiss calf has a broken wire panel exposing sharp points and the ends of the cut
panels for that entry expose sharp points to the calf.
-The pen for the nanny goats has loose wire fence along the back west side of the pen.
Animals could get injured on sharp/rough edges and loose wire. Ensure that enclosures and fixtures such as
shelters inside of enclosures are maintained structurally sound and free of sharp points for the safety of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the unopened feed bags stored for the white-tailed deer in the barn had an inch-sized hole in it with rough
edges around it and around that hole was spilled feed with rodent droppings. The feed storage shed also had some
spilled feed in the northwest corner with rodent droppings in the same area. These are signs that some kind of
vermin is getting into the whitetails' feed and the feed shed. Rodents can contaminate feed and cause animals to
get sick that eat rodent-contaminated feed. The facility must maintain animal feed storage areas clean, implement
safe and effective pest control measures, and ensure storage methods protect animal feed supplies from rodent
access.

Shelter from inclement weather.
A llama is housed with a bison and it was observed that the bison took up most of the shed for shade and the
llama's minimal shade was provided by tires hanging on two elevated posts. The facility representative reported
that the bison and llama don't bother each other but they also don't really get close to each other and don't share
the roofed shelter in the enclosure. In inclement weather, the llama's area of minimal shade under the elevated
tires would not provide much shelter from inclement weather. Lack of access to shelter can cause animals
unnecessary discomfort. An additional shelter that the llama is free to use must be provided so that both animals in
the enclosure have free access to protection from inclement weather.

WATERING.
The prairie dogs' water bowl was soiled and had soiled water in it. It had a dark build-up of material and loose
leaves in it. Also, the sow with piglets had little water left in a soiled watering pan and was reported to have been
watered in the morning but that she plays in the watering pan and splashes it out. It is good that she can play in
water as this is a species-typical activity, but either additional clean water should be provided more frequently or
better yet secure a watering receptacle in a manner that she can't play in it addition to the one that she plays in so
that adequate clean drinking water is available throughout the day. Soiled water can cause animals to get sick.
Ensure that all animals are provided with adequate clean drinking water to maintain them healthy.
