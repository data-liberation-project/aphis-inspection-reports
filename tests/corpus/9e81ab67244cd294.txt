2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The elephant husbandry staff employs two dogs to watch the elephants and alert the staff to elephants' behavior
while the handlers are in free contact. Due to weather on the day of inspection, only a limited interaction between
dogs and elephants could be observed by APHIS officials. The manager was asked to demonstrate an example of
this type of interaction, and so he called one of the dogs to create a barrier between the husbandry staff and an
elephant which had reached its trunk through the enclosure bars. The dog showed aggressive behavior, growling
and lunging at one elephant and entering its enclosure before being called by the manager. The manager also
reported the dogs' having bitten the elephants during the course of their work. Furthermore, a CBS News clip from
May 13, 2014, which was verified by the facility representatives, showed the elephants exhibiting signs of distress
when charged by one of the dogs, including ear flapping, trumpeting, and turning and running away. The manager
was clear that the dogs are not herding the elephants but are protecting the keepers during free contact. Having the
dogs interact with the elephants by unrestrained lunging and biting may cause undue stress to the elephants. All
animal handling must be done in a manner that does not cause behavioral stress.

WATER QUALITY.
There is one female sea lion (Maggie) with significant blue discoloration affecting both eyes, and a prolonged history
of corneal edema flare-ups according to the keepers and the attending veterinarian. Also in discussion with the
veterinarian it was discovered that most of the marine mammals have had issues with corneal disease. Upon
inspection of water quality records both from the past month and some from ~6 months ago, it was noted that the
chlorine levels (especially in the sea lion pools) have been elevated. The chlorine level had reached as high as 8
PPM, and was over 2 PPM on 5 separate days during December 2014. Excessive chemical additives like chlorine
can cause ocular problems in these species. Levels of chlorine in marine mammal enclosures must be maintained
so there is no detrimental effect to the health of the animals contained therein.
