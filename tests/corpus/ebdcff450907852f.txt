FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The walk in refrigerator has maintained consistent temperatures above 40 degrees since January 2014. The floor
of this refrigerator also has an area in the back right corner where the paint has worn away and has exposed the
underlying rock matrix. This area can no longer be cleaned & sanitized due to the porosity of the exposed concrete
floor in this area.
The current temperatures and condition of the floor in this refrigerator prevents proper cleaning of this unit and does
not adequately protect the food from deterioration & spoilage
