ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The current plan does not individually address the singly housed vervet, spider monkey, capuchin or
chimpanzee. Non-human primates known to exist in social groups in nature must have their specific needs
addressed in the written plan to promote their psychological well-being. The plan must be updated to address the
specific needs of each singly housed primate. It shall be reviewed and approved by your attending veterinarian.
