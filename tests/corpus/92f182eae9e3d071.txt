2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An eye ointment (Vetropolycin HC) that was being used to treat eyes in the male building expired 07-16. Expired
medications may not be effective for the condition being treated and some medications become toxic once expired.
Ensure that expired medications are not used on animals at the facility.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure, containing two dogs, there is a piece of carpet for the dogs to sit on. The edges of the carpet
have been excessively torn and shredded by the dogs. The damaged areas of the carpet can not be readily
cleaned and sanitized which could increase the risk of disease.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must
be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace the damaged carpet or alter it in a manner that allows
for the proper cleaning and sanitizing of the surface to occur.
3.6(a)(2)(x) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "Male Building" one male Shih tzu was observed to be walking back and forth in the outdoor portion of his
enclosure in a hesitant manner. This section of the enclosure has raised tender foot flooring, and the inspectors
observed the dog's feet pass through the openings in the flooring at least four times. Openings in the flooring large
enough to allow the animals' feet to pass through could cause injury.
Primary enclosures must have flooring constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury and
does not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any openings. The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that
does not allow the dog's feet to pass through the flooring. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures
keep the dogs safe from injury at all times.The inspection was conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell, VMO Scott Welch, an IDALS representative and the facility
representative.
The exit interview was conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell, VMO Scott Welch, and the facility representative.
