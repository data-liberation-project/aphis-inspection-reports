2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a 15 year old Barbados-cross black and white colored, female sheep which appeared to have a loss of
vision indicated by the animal bumping into various objects during inspection. This sheep displayed abnormal
behaviors including head twitching as well an occasional circling type of gait. Upon closer inspection, the sheep
also showed an irregular type of eye movement. The facility representative stated he noticed the apparent
blindness approximately three days ago and isolated the animal in a barn; however this animal has not received
veterinary care at this time. The abnormal behaviors exhibited by this animal may be a sign of infection, injury, or
other disease process. Additionally, these abnormal behaviors by the animal may cause the animal to experience
pain, stress and or discomfort.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian that can give an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for the problem cited above. The
licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries.
This animal was evaluated and treated by a veterinarian during this inspection.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure housing six goats had an approximate 20 ft section of chain link fencing that is in disrepair. The lower
edges of the metal fence were bent inward with sharp points protruding into the enclosure. Additionally, this has
created a gap large enough for the animal's limbs or head to become stuck and therefore poses the risk of injury to
animals in this enclosure.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, holes, and gaps/openings in
order to protect the animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to
ensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to containthe animals.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
An approximate 8 ft long section of perimeter fence in disrepair at the south end of the facility has a measured
height of 5 ft 4 in. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals, such as, but not limited to, large
felines (e.g., lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, etc.), bears, wolves, rhinoceros, and elephants, or less than 6 feet high
for other animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The perimeter fence also acts as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility. Some of the regulated species of animals at this facility are
required to have at least the 6 foot high perimeter fence surrounding their enclosures. This facility must ensure the
required 6ft. minimum height is being maintained.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
