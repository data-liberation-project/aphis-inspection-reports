****Elective and pre-shipment physical exams were performed on 11 wallabies on 15 Oct 2015 in the wallaby barn
area. The wallaby identified as (cid:28)"White Left"(cid:29) stopped breathing while anesthetized with isoflorane via a mask. The
veterinary staff attempted to resuscitate the animal but she and her joey eventually died. While attempting
resuscitation on this animal, the veterinary staff did not have emergency drugs or an ambu bag available in the
barn. Endotracheal tubes were available but a fully functional laryngeal scope with which to place the endotracheal
tube was not. In addition, the (cid:28)"bag"(cid:29) on the isoflorane machine fell off at some point in the process, preventing staff
from assisting with respiration for the animal. The absence of emergency drugs and appropriate equipment hinders
the ability to respond in case of a medical emergency. The facility must use appropriate methods to diagnose, treat
diseases and injuries, and provide emergency care. To be corrected by 29 October 2015.
****Two separate enclosures housing the four Lar (white handed) gibbons contained loose-watery stool. One singly
housed female Lar gibbon was observed expelling watery stool during the inspection. When asked, a primate
keeper and interim superintendent stated that it is normal for white handed gibbons to have loose stool. They also
stated that these animals have always had loose stool since arriving at the facility. As part of the facility'(cid:25)s
preventative program of veterinary care, the animals undergo parasite screening via fecal exams twice per year.
However, these exams have not been done recently, to screen for potential causes of the watery stool. Additionally,
no other diagnostic tests have been done in order to determine the cause of the on-going current problems.
Watery stool is abnormal and may be an indication of an underlying health issue including bacterial or parasitic
infection, increased stress or inappropriate diet.
As part of the programs of adequate veterinary care, the facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs
of health problems are evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner, including appropriate diagnostic tests, in
order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
****The male singing dog (ID 13M016) was observed to persistently pace in a circular pattern within his enclosure.
The AC personnel observed the animal two different times, for approximately 10 minutes each, while the animal
nearly continuously paced in the circular pattern. No notations were present in the animal's veterinary medicalrecord regarding this abnormal behavior. When asked about this abnormal behavior, the attending veterinarian
stated to the VMOs that she was aware that the animal paced but had not been consulted regarding the behavior by
the zoo staff. This abnormal behavior suggests that the animal may be experiencing psychological stress. The AV
must evaluate the animal and be involved in the development of a plan, implementation and follow-up of that plan,
to minimize the stress and abnormal behavior of this animal.
As part of the programs of adequate veterinary care, the facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs
of veterinary medical problems, including abnormal behavior, are evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner in
order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
****Several expired medications and suture material were found intermingled with current drugs in the storage areas
during this inspection: Rimadyl expired 12/2012, Artificial Tears expired 2012 October, PDS II expired Jul 01, and
Vicryl expired Jan 07 and Jul 00.
The use of expired medications is not considered to be safe or appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose,
and treat diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience
pain and distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects.
The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. To be corrected by 11 November 2015

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Elective and pre-shipment physical exams were performed on 11 wallabies on 15 Oct 2015 in the wallaby barn
area. All of the animals were reported to be stressed to some degree and not easily corralled during the capture
process according to facility representatives. Two of the wallabies ("yellow right" and "white right") were showing
signs of significant stress and/or medical problems as a result of the capture procedure.
The wallabies were recovered from anesthesia in crates in the barn area and allowed to return to the exhibit when
they were ambulatory. All animals, including those with veterinary medical problems, were left in the multi-species
exhibit (swans and emus) with access to the outdoor yard and heated barn overnight. The animals were monitored
until the close of business at 5pm. According to the weather history on the Weather Undergound website, the low
temperature the night of 15 October was 36 degrees F. This facility did not have or arrange to make available an
appropriate space suitable for housing of the compromised animals following the procedures for monitoring and
treatment consistent with veterinary medical and nursing care. "Yellow right" was found dead in the enclosure
upon start of business on 16 Oct 2015. "White right" died during the day on 16 Oct 2015. Another wallaby identified
as "left blue" and her joey died on 16 Oct 2015.Failing to separate compromised animals from the multi-species exhibit and allowing the animals with known stress
and medical issues to remain in the exhibit overnight subjected them to the possibility of exposures to cold
temperature, compatibility issues with other animals, and physical exertion that could exacerbate the underlying
conditions. The facility must ensure that pre and post procedural care is provided in accordance with established
veterinary medical and nursing procedures. To be corrected by 29 October 2015.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***On 10/15-10/16/15, four red-necked wallabies died during or shortly after capture for physical exams. On
10/15/15, the facility'(cid:25)s 11 adult wallabies were scheduled to undergo capture for routine physical exam processing.
During the capture process, several of the wallabies became stressed and sustained injuries which ranged from
superficial abrasions to a maxilla fracture. Although signs of behavioral stress, distress, and injuries were observed
by several staff members, including management and the attending veterinarian, the capture and exam process
was continued. Four adults and 2 joeys subsequently died or were euthanized from what the attending veterinarian
stated and diagnosed as "(cid:28)capture myopathy"(cid:29).
The handling of these animals to facilitate physical exams was not conducted in a manner that prevented trauma,
behavioral stress, and physical harm. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as
possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm,
or unnecessary discomfort. To be corrected by 29 October 2015
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public viewing area of the lion exhibit is above the enclosure and overlooks the animal area. The distance
between the base of the enclosure below the viewing area to closest public space is 8 feet 5 inches on one side and
8 feet 7 inches on the other. This distance is not sufficient to prevent contact between the public and the animals
under all circumstances. The facility must ensure that there is sufficient distance and and/or barriers between the
animals and the general viewing public so as to ensure the safety of the animals and the public. To be corrected by

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the zebra barn, a bottle of comet cleaning powder with a shaker style top was found stored on a wire shelf
above two buckets of feed without lids. Storing cleaning supplies/chemicals above food for animals poses a risk of
feed contamination. Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored adequately to protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding or contamination. Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***There is a large accumulation of building materials and recycling near the back part of the enclosure housing 4
guanacos. The VMO noted that the accumulation was approximately 10 ft. from the animal enclosure, was wet from
recent precipitation and included cardboard boxes that likely were contaminated with food materials.
Accumulation of debris near animal enclosures can lead to pest infestation, disease transmission and reduced
health of the animals. Accumulations of debris shall be cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. To
be corrected by 4 November 2015.
Inspection was conducted on 10/27/15 and 10/28/15 with the interim superintendent, Veterinary Medical Officer
Margaret A Shaver and Supervisory VMO Kate Ziegerer.
Exit briefing was conducted on 10/28/15 with facility representative, Veterinary Medical Officer Margaret A Shaver
