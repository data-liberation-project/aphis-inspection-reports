2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The facility has an incomplete written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) approved by the attending veterinarian. A
part-time attending veterinarian is employed by the facility and visits weekly. Only the front page of the program of
veterinary care was provided as last signed on 8 August 2014.
The written PVC for this facility lacks specific guidance for the care of animals. Specific guidance from the attending
veterinarian is required for all medications and testing(i.e. blood parasites and infectious/zoonotic disease) by the
registrant. Programs such as body condition scoring and enrichment should be further discussed and assessed by
the attending veterinarian.
The written PVC requires additional guidance for the method of euthanasia to be used by the facility for animals and
the personnel trained and authorized to perform the euthanasia . This guidance and training in the procedure for
euthanasia by the attending veterinarian is required to ensure animals are humanely euthanized according to the
latest AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2013 edition).
Additional specific guidance is required for the Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate
guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does
not
ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by
developing and implementing a complete and accurate Program of Veterinary Care for the care and use of the
animals housed at the facility.
