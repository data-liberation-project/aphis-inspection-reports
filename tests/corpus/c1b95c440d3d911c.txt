2.40(b)(3) Critical Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult tri-color (brindle, tan, and white) male guinea pig was identified during an inspection that occurred on October 27,
2021 as having multiple open wounds and hair loss. During a follow-up inspection, when the licensee was asked about
this specific guinea pig, she responded that the animal had not been seen by the Attending Veterinarian and instead had
been euthanized by a family member in a manner not in accordance with the Program of Veterinary Care, which states
that all euthanasias need to be performed by the Attending Veterinarian.

Also during the previous inspection, the following animals were identified as needing veterinary care:
- An adult black and white guinea pig in enclosure #15 with hair loss on the right side of the nose
- An adult brindle guinea pig in enclosure #15 with hair loss around the left eye
- An older weanling tri-color (brindle, tan, and white) male guinea pig in enclosure #59 with hair loss on the nose
- An older weanling tri-color (black, tan, and white) guinea pig in enclosure #59 with hair loss on the nose

When observing these animals, it was noted that the animals were still housed with other guinea pigs, even though the
Program of Veterinary Care states that animals identified with ringworm must be removed immediately from enclosures so
as to limit spread. The licensee also stated that while the Attending Veterinarian had visited the premises the previous

day, she did not specifically look at these guinea pigs and therefore there are no treatment records to review for these
animals.

When the licensee was asked about treatment of these animals, she stated that all the guinea pigs were being treated
with a topical orange-colored liquid that was in a used peanut butter pretzels container but the Program of Veterinary Care
states that ringworm should be treated with a Miconazole nitrate 2% cream.

A failure to maintain direct communication with the Attending Veterinarian can result in a delay of care provided to animals
and can prolong animal health problems. Furthermore, utilizing a method of euthanasia not authorized by the Attending
Veterinarian can lead to further suffering of the animals. Correct by maintaining a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the Attending Veterinarian and following the Program of Veterinary Care to ensure animal health and
well-being. This remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
