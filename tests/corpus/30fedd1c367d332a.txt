ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30 PM on
15-Apr-19.
Arrived at facility and called the contact phone number (on the East Coast) and left a message. Security directed
me to their veterinarian, no covered species at the facility for two years. Spoke to the licensee the next day - this
site is not active and has no covered species.
