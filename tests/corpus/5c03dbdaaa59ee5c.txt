Female chocolate poodle (#354) is underweight. Physical inspection of the dog by a Veterinary Medical Officer (VMO)
revealed the spine is prominent and there is little fat and muscle covering the dog's frame. The VMO found the hind legs
of the dog were most affected by muscle wasting and the upper leg bone was easily felt. The dog has a litter of two
puppies. The facility representative has not noticed the animal's condition and the dog has not been evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian.

Poor body condition could indicate an underlying health issue and could lead to serious health issues.
