A black and white male pomeranian microchip# 961001200049590 had complete hair loss on his tail, dry flaky skin
on his torso, and numerous hair mats all over his body. The dog also had severe accumulation of dental tartar and
inflamed gums with ulceration over some teeth. Hair loss and dry skin are indications of potential skin disease.
Hair mats can cause discomfort and lead to underlying skin infection. Mats should be removed or brushed out as
needed. Dental disease causes significant pain and discomfort, affects the ability to eat, and can lead to a variety of
health problems.
Following the inspection, USDA inspectors met with the attending veterinarian for this facility. He confirmed that he
had not seen or consulted about the dog in question. This dog should be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian
within 5 days, and treated appropriately.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- One building had a Husky female with 4 pups. Inside the building one wall was covered with sheets of particle
board, at least half the 4 foot by 8 foot sheet was chewed away. Chewed wood in primary enclosures could lead to
possible injury or health risks for the dog. Open holes left from chewed wood could allow the dog access to
insulation creating potential health problems if the dog swallows exposed insulation. Exposed insulation can also
provide easy access for and could be used as a living area for any vermin or pests that might be living with the
dogs. Repairing or replacing the chewed wood will help to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.
- In the outdoor enclosure housing three labradors and one husky, there is a gap in the top right corner of the pen
gate with exposed metal points. Two strands of hot wire run along the top of the fence, but the hot wire was not
functional. This is a potential injury or entrapment risk to the animals. The gate should be reset to eliminate the
gap, and metal fence points removed. The hot wire should be functional, or removed.
There is also a sheet of metal siding leaning against the inside back fence of this enclosure. This serves no useful
purpose and should be removed from the pen. Next to this sheet of siding is a gate leading to an enclosure with amother husky and puppies. The gate is horse panel fencing covered by a sheet of smaller gauge wire, but the
sheet of wire is peeling down from the top leaving a loose rolled section of wire. This is a potential injury risk and
needs to be repaired or removed.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The three outdoor enclosures all had an accumulation of fecal matter, old soiled bedding and other debris scattered
on the ground. Waste material must be removed from the enclosure as often as needed to protect the dogs from
environmental contamination. The dogs were observed by inspectors walking around and in the fecal matter. Daily
removal, or more often if required removal of the waste helps to ensure the health and well-being of the dogs. To

3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor enclosure housing a mother labrador and four puppies has standing puddles of dirty, murky water in
holes around the water tub. The mother labrador has to stand in or wade through this contaminated water to reach
her drinking water. Enclosures must have adequate drainage to prevent the accumulation of standing water. The
facility should eliminate any holes or low areas in the ground, and ensure the animals are able to freely access
clean food and potable water.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two litters of puppies were being kept in outdoor housing. Both litters were approximately 1 week old, per facility
representative. Temperature for the region at the time of inspection was 36 F. The low temperature in the region
for the previous night (October 30) was 32 F. The litter of Labrador puppies were held in a shelter in an outdoor
pen. The inner wall of the shelter was measured by IR at 40 F. The litter of Husky puppies were held in an
unheated room and located in a corner of the room next to an exposed metal wall with no insulation. All puppies in
both litters were tightly huddled together.
Following the inspection, USDA inspectors met with the attending veterinarian to discuss this housing situation. The
attending veterinarian was not aware that puppies were being housed in these conditions, and stated that he did not
approve of puppies at that age being kept outdoors since they could not appropriately thermo-regulate until they
were a few weeks older.Cold weather can have a severe impact on the health and welfare of young dogs. Puppies cannot be housed
outdoors unless specifically approved by the attending veterinarian. The outdoor housing of these puppies must be
approved by the attending veterinarian or they must be moved to an indoor or appropriate sheltered housing facility.

3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The enclosure containing the Labrador Retrievers and Husky had plastic barrels for the shelter. None of the barrels
had adequate bedding in them. There was hay or straw scattered in the enclosure with little or none left in the
barrels. Owner explained that bedding was put in the barrels but the dogs drag it out. The temperature for the area
according to local weather reports was 32 degrees F.on 10-30-2019. Additional bedded should have been added
to the shelters in the enclosure. Licensee must provide bedding for the dogs in the outdoor enclosures and when
temperatures are below 50 degrees F and additional bedding for the shelters when the temperature falls below 35
degrees F. Inadequate bedding can cause stress and discomfort for the dogs. Owners son advised inspectors that
straw/bedding would be put in the plastic barrels after inspection was completed.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One outdoor enclosure with three Labrador retrievers and a Husky had plastic barrels for shelter. The barrels being
used by the facility are too small to serve as adequate shelter for any of the dogs kept in this enclosure. Each dog
must be able to enter a shelter and make normal postural adjustments, such as siting, standing and turning freely.
There must be sufficient number and size of shelters for each dog to use at the same time. Not having an adequate
size shelter may cause stress and discomfort for the dog. Providing adequate shelter during the cold wet weather
can help to protect the health and well-being of the dogs. To be corrected by 11-07-2019.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The premises around the kennel building has numerous piles of old fencing, old enclosures, building material, and
trash. There are areas next to the kennel building that are overgrown with brush and weeds. These areas can
harbor breeding of vermin or other disease hazards that can adversely affect the health and well being of the dogs.
Owner must organize the building materials and enclosures and other items so that the area can be properly
maintained. Owner must trim and remove overgrown weeds and grasses away from the fences so they can
routinely maintain the grounds around the kennel. To be corrected by 11-12-2019Additional Inspectors
