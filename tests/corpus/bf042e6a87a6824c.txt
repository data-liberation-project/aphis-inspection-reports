2.50(a)(2) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***In the broker area there were two Shih Tzu puppies and one Beagle puppy housed in the same enclosure and in
the whelping area, there were ten puppies. None of these puppies had individual identification. There were two
plastic type collars laying in an empty cage in the whelping area, yet both of these collars had the same numbers
listed on them. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory,
disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must identify all puppies that are less than 16
weeks old. Acceptable forms of identification include a microchip, a collar and tag, a plastic-type collar with the
required information legibly written, or a cage card as long as all the puppies in the enclosure are from the same
litter.
This inspection began at 1035.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative, Konnie Plumlee, VMO and
Beverly Hicks, ACI.
