FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The entire length of metal wire fencing along one side of the enclosure with eight goats, three sheep, and one
llama, was in disrepair and not structurally sound.
Many of the wooden posts supporting the fence were unstable and leaning at odd angles. Portions of the barbed
wire fencing were loose, creating gaps in the fencing. There were sharp points on several of the metal wires holding
the fencing to the posts, which pointed into the enclosure.
There was a large gap between the metal gate and the fence post. An additional gate had been placed into this
gap, however the gate was not tethered to anything and was unstable.
A portion of the metal fencing had old farming equipment, including metal feeders and gates, pushed up against it.
This equipment had created gaps and sharp points in the wire fencing. The animals within the enclosure were able
to make contact with this equipment due to the holes in the fence.
***A portion of the wire fencing surrounding the primary enclosure of three horses and eight cows was in disrepair.
The fencing was leaning in an outward direction from the enclosure. There were several sharp points created by the
wiring that attached the fencing to the metal posts.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
