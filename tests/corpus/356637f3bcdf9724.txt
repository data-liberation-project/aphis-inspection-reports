2.8
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The Inspector arrived at the facility for a routine inspection at 2:30 pm on October 12, 2017. The licensee was
contacted by phone and stated to the Inspector that he had moved from this address several weeks ago. He stated
that no animals were at this site. Failure to promptly notify Animal Care (AC) of changes in operation does not allow
officials to inspect for the health and well-being of the animals. The licensee is required to promptly notify the AC
Regional Director by certified mail of any change in the name, address, management, or substantial control or
ownership of his business or operation, or of any additional sites, within 10 days of any change.
