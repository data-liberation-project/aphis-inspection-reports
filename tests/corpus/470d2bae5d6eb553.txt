2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:15 AM on
09-APR-19.The State of MA Dept of Ag Inspector and USDA official were on the premise at ~11:15 AM on 4/9/19.
No one was present at this address. I called the licensee to ask him if he could meet us at the property. The
licensee said that he was in CT and could not do an inspection. I asked if there was someone else in the area that
could do the inspection with us. He again told me that he was in CT and not available. I explained that I would be
writing this up as a "repeat" attempted inspection because of our attempted inspection on 9/12/18.
We decided to go to his other place of business, that is approximately 5 miles away, in Athol, MA. As we entered
this place of business the licensee was present. We again asked him to accompany us, or provide us a responsible
adult to accompany us, to complete an inspection. Licensee declined again.
Each exhibitor shall allow APHIS officials to enter their business, inspect the facilities and the records for
compliance.
