FEEDING.
***There were self-feeders within at least five enclosures housing dogs that had a build up of food debris and grime
along the inside surfaces of the feeders. The accumulation of grime and debris on the self-feeders increases the
risk of feed contamination and may decrease the palatablity of the feed. The licensee must ensure that all food
receptacles are kept clean and sanitized at least every two weeks. TO BE CORRECTED BY: July 29, 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
