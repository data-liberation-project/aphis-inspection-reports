2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 pm on
19-Jan-17.
I called the owner when I was 20 minutes away from the facility because there was no cellular service beyond that
point. I arrived at the facility at 12:00 pm and no one appeared to be on the premises. I waited for 30 minutes and
then left the facility. Once I obtained cellular service again I attempted to contact the owner for the second time. The
owner answered and stated that he was unable to conduct an inspection at that time. I informed him that this was
the 2nd attempted inspection and to forward me some optimal time frames in which he would be available. I also
included my business card along with the attempted inspection report.
