FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The animal haul-out areas in the outdoor marine mammal pool have multiple locations with crumbling/cracking
concrete and deteriorating fiberglass. Pieces of broken concrete/fiberglass could potentially fall into the pool and be
ingested by the animals or an animal's skin could be injured by the rough surfaces as they are pulling themselves
up out of the pool. Repairs must be made to all of the deteriorating pool surfaces in order to maintain the structural
strength of this facility and to prevent injury to the 3 Harbor seals housed in this enclosure. To be corrected by:
