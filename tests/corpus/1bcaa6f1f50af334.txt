2.40(b)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Yorkshire terrier (#3961) has a thick buildup of dark brown colored organic material on the upper and lower
canine and cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth. The gums are red and slightly inflamed above the upper right canine
tooth. The licensee stated that he cleaned this dog's teeth on June 21, 2021.

Female mixed breed grey colored dog (#2842) has a thick buildup of a dark brown colored organic material on at least
half the surface of the upper right and left canine teeth. The entire surface of the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the
mouth are covered in a greyish-brown colored material. The licensee stated that he cleaned the dog's teeth on June 07,
2021.

Male Maltese (#4044) has a buildup of a dark brown colored organic material covering the majority of the surface of the
upper canine teeth and cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth. Areas of grey material are located along the gum line of
the upper canine and cheek teeth. The lower left cheek teeth are entirely encased in a thick dark brown material. The
gums are slightly inflamed and reddened.

Male Yorkshire terrier (#4067) has a thick buildup of a dark brown to black colored material covering the majority of the

surface of the upper canine teeth and front teeth and completely encasing the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the
mouth. The gums are reddened and inflamed along the upper right cheek teeth and canine tooth. The licensee stated he
cleaned this dog's teeth on June 14, 2021.

Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. The licensee must
have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

The licensee is performing the euthanasia of his dogs. The Program of Veterinary Care indicates the licensee will
perform the euthanasia, but the method of euthanasia to be performed is missing. Failure to document the method of
euthanasia interferes with APHIS officials ability to determine if the method meets the definition of euthanasia in the
Animal Welfare Act and that it is being properly performed.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee, in
consultation with their attending veterinarian, must document on the Program of Veterinary Care the method of
euthanasia that will be performed. The licensee must ensure the Program of Veterinary Care is complete at all times.

The licensee is conducting the euthanasia of the dogs himself. The licensee stated that he is given a syringe containing a

drug, which is thought to be Beuthanasia-D, from the attending veterinarian. He then injects the drug through the animal's
abdominal wall and into the stomach. He then places the dog back into its enclosure and returns later to ensure it has
died. The instructions for Beuthanasia-D are to administer it as an intravenous injection which will result in rapid and
painless euthanasia.

A Veterinary Medical Officer spoke to the Attending Veterinarian who stated that he did not give the drug to the licensee
and did not authorize euthanasia with an intraabdominal injection.

Failure to have the method of euthanasia approved by the Attending Veterinarian, as well as injecting a drug
inappropriately could result in a prolonged and/or painful death which is not compliant with the definition of euthanasia in
the Animal Welfare Act.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Licensees, in
consultation with their Attending Veterinarian, may use methods of euthanasia that meet the definition of euthanasia in the
Animal Welfare Regulations, which allows for the use of humane methods that either:

o produce rapid unconsciousness and subsequent death without evidence of pain or distress, or
o utilize anesthesia produced by an agent that causes painless loss of consciousness and subsequent death.

The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian to determine a method of euthanasia that is appropriate and
meets the definition of euthanasia in the Animal Welfare Act and is documented on the Program of Veterinary Care.

3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
One enclosure, containing one adult dog, has a plastic resting board. All four edges of the board have been excessively
chewed and worn by the dog. The damaged edges of the board cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized which could
increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities - including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility - that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when
worn or soiled. The licensee must alter the resting board in a manner that eliminates the damaged edges. The licensee
must ensure that all surfaces are in good repair at all times.

3.3(e)(1)(iii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The facility provides the dogs with wooden resting boards and at least four of these boards, accessed by a total of four
dogs, are no longer impervious to moisture. Each of these boards has been scratched, chewed, or damaged by the
animals. One board was located beneath a dripping waterer and it had become fully saturated and the inspector was able
to use her ink pen to leave a depression in the board after applying gentle pressure. Wood that is not impervious to
moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized which could raise the risk of disease towards the animals.


Areas in sheltered housing facilities must be impervious to moisture including all walls, boxes, houses, dens, and other
surfaces in contact with the animals. The licensee must either remove the wooden boards or alter them in a manner that
will make them impervious to moisture. The licensee must ensure all surfaces are properly maintained at all times.

3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility no longer uses the metal self feeders attached to the front gates of the enclosures, but the dogs still have
direct access to them. At least three metal feeders, accessed by a total of four dogs, have a buildup of spiderwebs, dirt,
and hair inside of them. One of the feeders also has old, dried, fecal material inside it.

One enclosure containing two dogs has a thick, dark brown buildup of organic material and hair coating the lower metal
bars of the front gate.

Buildup of organic material, dirt, hair and other disease hazards could have a negative impact on the health and well-
being of the dogs.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
The licensee must sanitize the metal feeders and gate front in order to reduce the risk of disease.

3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee had the attending veterinarian physically examine each dog on 06/07/21, but there is no medical record
documenting the exams and the results of the exams. Failure to document the exams interferes with APHIS officials
ability to determine if the dog is receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. The
licensee must document all required information for the physical examination of each dog. The licensee must ensure
medical records are kept for each animal.
