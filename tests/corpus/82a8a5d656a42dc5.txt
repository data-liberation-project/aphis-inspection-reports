ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1130 on
11-Apr-18. We went to the front office of the campground. I knocked on the door and no one answered. We did
not see anyone around so we went to the licensee's house. I knocked on the front door and no one answered. I
called the licensee and left a message. After 30 minutes of waiting, we then left the property.
End of report.
