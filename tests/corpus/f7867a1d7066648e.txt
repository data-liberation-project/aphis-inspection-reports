3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. A skunk escaped from its enclosure and was never found or recovered by the facility staff. The skunk repeatedly
escaped from inside of its enclosure that was located in the baby barn area of the facility per the head animal
caretaker. The skunk was placed into a different enclosure after the initial escape per the head animal caretaker,
however; the animal escaped from that enclosure. Animals must be housed in enclosures that properly contain
them to prevent escapes.
Assure all animals are housed in species appropriate enclosures that contain them.
2. An area of exposed insulation, approximately two feet high by three feet long, is located on a wall adjacent to the
food preparation area. Additionally, there were boxes of various fruits and vegetables being stored on a table
adjacent to the exposed insulation. The insulation could potentially contaminate the animals' food and/or food
preparation surfaces.
Repair, replace, or cover the exposed insulation to assure that the animals' food and food preparation surfaces do
not become contaminated.
3. A roll of previously used fencing and pieces of scrap fence are located within the enclosure housing twelve goats
and two llamas. The roll of used fencing and the scrap fence both have sharp points that are accessible to the
animals. The sharp points could potentially injure the animals.
Remove the used and scrap fence to prevent potential injury to the animals.
