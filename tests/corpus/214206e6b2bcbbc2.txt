MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
1. On 11/9/12 husbandry staff found a loose hamster on the floor of the dirty side of the cage wash room.
Veterinary staff assessed the hamster and humanely euthanized the animal. Upon being notified and in response
to this incident, the IACUC determined that the hamster had been administered an experimental agent on 11/7/12
and further concluded that a member of the laboratory staff was responsible for the events that led to the hamster
being found loose in the dirty side of the cage wash room.
Per this Section of the Regulations, handling of animals by all personnel, including laboratory staff, shall be done as
carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause behavioral stress or unnecessary discomfort.
The IACUC acted promptly to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW, and
swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents.
Item has been corrected.
NOTE - This was a focused inspection. Exit interview held 2/26/15 on-site with facility representatives.
