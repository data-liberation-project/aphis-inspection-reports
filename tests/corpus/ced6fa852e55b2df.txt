ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One white colored adult male Standard Poodle (microchip number 985121007730713) was visualized shaking its
head during the facility inspection. Examination of the underside of the ear revealed a blackish looking substance
was covering the underside of the ear. The tissue on the underside of the ear was moist, reddened and thickened in
appearance. In addition, a foul odor coming from the ear was detected by the inspector. The licensee stated they
first noticed the condition on 12/29/15. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted nor had any treatment
been provided at the time of inspection. The licensee did call the attending veterinarian during the facility
inspection. Head shaking and thickened tissue in the ears may indicate infection, parasites, or chronic inflammation
which can cause discomfort, pain, and possible hearing loss if left untreated. The licensee must have this animal
examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be
documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by the end of business 1/5/2016.
