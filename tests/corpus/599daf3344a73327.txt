FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The three newly arrived rabbits are living in a wire mesh sided hutch with a roof placed next to a barn. Three sides
are open to the rain and wind. It was raining during today's inspection. If windy, the rain can blow into the enclosure
making it difficult for the rabbits to stay dry. There is currently no shelter structure within the enclosure for the rabbits
to seek shelter from the elements. The rabbits housed outdoors shall be provided with access to shelter. Correct by
9/24/17.
3.53(a)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The rabbit water and food containers in the bunny village are exposed to the weather elements. The water bowl
surfaces are coated in green algae growth and the pelleted rabbit feed is no longer in pellet shape but has
deteriorated to a mushy powder like substance. It was raining during the inspection and the feed/water containers
had no protection from the rain. There is currently nothing constructed as part of this outdoor enclosure to protect
the feed receptacles from the elements (such as sun, rain etc). Deteriorated feed and contaminated water may not
be palatable to the rabbits and may lose nutritional value. The enclosure must be constructed and maintained to
ensure the rabbits have convenient access to clean food and water. Correct by 9/30/17.
3.55 REPEAT
WATERING.
The sides and bottom of the water receptacle for the five rabbits in the bunny village are coated with green algae
and require cleaning and sanitizing. Drinking contaminated water can lead to disease and illness or may cause
animals to stop drinking leading to dehydration. All water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized (detergent
followed by disinfectant or detergent/disinfectant combo) when dirty and at least once every 2 weeks.
3.125(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two areas of the racing pig area require repair.
*The 2x4 acting as a support beam for the back of the wire fencing part of the back wall of the housing structure has
been chewed/scratched by previous occupants and is very thin in places. Any pressure or further chewing of this
wood may lead to the wood beam breaking which will lead to structural strength loss of the wire fencing. Correct by
10/7/17.
*The area where the pig racing grass surface meets the porch (requires the pigs to leave the ground and step up
onto the porch) has two areas that need repair. There is a large hole/opening under the porch that the pigs could try
to escape into or injure themselves stepping into the hole. The surface of the porch is extremely slippery when wet
(rained during inspection) such that the inspector and facility representative both slid when they stepped onto the
porch. This slippery footing may lead to slipping and injury of the pigs as they come racing up onto the porch.
Correct prior to any racing of the pigs.
The brown and white goat cited on the previous inspection has been evaluated by a veterinarian; haircoat looks
good today.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
