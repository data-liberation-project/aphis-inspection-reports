ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several of the guinea pigs appear underweight, with thin hair coats. A number of them have chewed ears. Though
noted by facility staff, a veterinarian has not been contacted nor have treatments been initiated. Animal welfare is at
risk. Direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Consultation with a licensed veterinarian
is needed for diagnosis and treatment.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Several enclosures are wet and/or heavily soiled. Shelves closer to the floor seem to be most commonly affected.
Though they were cleaned and sanitized just three days ago, affected enclosures remain too dirty. A dirty
environment contributes to animal stress and disease. Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris. A program must be developed and maintained which
provides effective cleaning and sanitation.
