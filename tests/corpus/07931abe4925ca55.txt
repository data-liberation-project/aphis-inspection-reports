2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for animals at hand containing required information on acquisition/disposition information of these were
found to be incomplete and/or inadequate. Specifically, disposition records for puppies born at the premises were
incomplete. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose
information on purchased or otherwise acquired animals, owned, held, or otherwise in possession or under control,
or any animal that is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of. The records must include any
offspring born of any animal while in the licensee's possession or under her control. The licensee must use the
Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) and the Record of Disposition of Dogs and
Cats (APHIS Form 7006) to make, keep and maintain the information required by federal regulations under this
section.
