3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In September, 2016, a pig was found loose in a housing room. This pig had damaged its exteriorized arterial and
venous catheter lines and was actively bleeding. These lines were damaged when the pig escaped its enclosure by
lifting a panel that was not appropriately secured due to a damaged locking mechanism. When the pig was
discovered, these lines were immediately clamped off but the pig had already experienced a severe amount of
blood loss and the decision was made to humanely euthanize the animal. Enclosures housing animals should be
kept in good repair to contain the animals and protect them from injury. Since the time of the incident all similar
enclosures have been reviewed by the facility and have been repaired if needed. No other incidents of escape have
occurred.
