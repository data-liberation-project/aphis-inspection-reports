HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On December 13, 2016, approximately at 2:00 pm, and during a training session, one of three keepers assigned to
the Sumatran tiger exhibit was bit by an adult male tiger named "Berani." While conducting training, the keeper was
hand/palm feeding pieces of meat to the tiger through the mesh barrier. Unfortunately, the keeper's left index finger
slipped through along with meat, and consequently the tiger bit off the tip of the finger. The keeper did not follow
established safety and hand-feeding procedures and policies. The facility's established policy is for keepers to not
hand-feed carnivores; keepers must use tongs and/or other tools to feed carnivores.
Even tough the tiger was always contained and was not physically harmed, the used training protocol (painting) may
have caused unnecessary behavioral stress to the animal. Officials at the facility communicated that safety,
hand-feeding and training protocols/policies will be re-examined, and to prevent similar incidents, if needed, these
would be amended.
This was a focused inspection limited to the tiger incident, the associated tiger's primary enclosure, housing areas
and exhibit.
The particulars that led to the incident and interaction between the tiger and keeper are currently under internal
review by officials at Zoo Miami.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Mr. Matthew James, Chief of the Animal Science Division at
Zoo Miami.
