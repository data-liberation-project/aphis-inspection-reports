2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A spider monkey escape was documented on records after the Attending veterinarian was contacted and different
attempts to capture the primate in different ways were unsuccessful.
The primary cause of the escape was human error by the primate keeper. The end result of the escape was a dead
primate after it was darted.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
I was corrected after the incident by removing the employee from the facility.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
