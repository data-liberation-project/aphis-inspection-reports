2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
According to the Executive Director (ED) and documents provided, Jag, a 22yo male bottlenose dolphin died after an
accidental submergence with inspiration of salt water.
The dolphin was undergoing treatment in the medical pool for a health condition and animal care staff, including trainers,
were present to assist. Jag was voluntarily trained for the treatment and had received them in this pool previously without
incident. The ED stated there has not been a malfunction of the restraint system of the medical pool during the 10 years
of its use. Due to the frequency of the treatments, manual restraint was now required for Jag. While being handled for his
therapy, Jag pushed through the trainers and swam beneath the false bottom of the pool enclosure. Despite immediate
attempts to direct him out of the enclosure by opening the gates to adjacent pools and cutting the net of the false bottom,
the animal expired. Corrective action has since been implemented to minimize the risk of animal injury while handled for
medical treatment. The presence of animal care staff and trainers may not be sufficient to restrain a dolphin, especially
under stressful conditions. A system should be in place to ensure safe handling of animals, especially while undergoing
medical treatments. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does
not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.



Correct from this time forward.
