FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Two sheep had very long wool, and over the rump area the wool was stained and damp. The sheep are housed in a
barn at night where the run-off from other animals flows into their section of the enclosure, and staff reports that it is
difficult to keep their area dry.
Drainage in the indoor housing enclosure must be adequate to facilitate good husbandry. Animals should be
maintained well-groomed, clean and dry, in order to ensure their comfort and good health. Measure should be taken
immediately to address the needs of these sheep.
To be corrected immediately.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
