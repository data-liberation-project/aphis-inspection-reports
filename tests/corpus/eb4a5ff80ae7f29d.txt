3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There were approximately ten hedgehog cages which had an excessive accumulation of excreta on the cage
flooring and mixed within the animals' bedding material. Additionally, there was a thick buildup of excreta on
several of the exercise wheels within these cages. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained and to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of
the enclosures should be more frequent and effective to prevent the buildup of excreta.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility owner.
