Structural strength. The enclosure housing the two tigers had chain-link fencing pulled away from the bottom and
top of one post by the shelter. There was some chain-link fencing bent inward along the top wall of the enclosure
above the roof of the shelter. In the lower section of the enclosure the chain-link fencing wrapped around two posts
was pulled away at the top. The tigers may be injured on the damaged fence wire. The chain-link fencing on the
tiger enclosure must be repaired to protect the animals from injury and to contain them securely. During the
inspection facility personnel repaired the chain-link fencing on the tiger enclosure.
