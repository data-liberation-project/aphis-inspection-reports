3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several of the lixit tips for the automatic water drinkers in the enclosures were rusted. Once these become rusted
they can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized and can cause health issues for the animals. These need to
be maintained and kept in good repair for the health of the animals.
A section of the metal kennel doors were also rusted and the seal on several sections of the wood frame have been
scratched and chewed on, which makes it now no longer impervious to moisture and cannot be properly cleaned
and sanitized. Routine maintenance and repair of the rust and wooded areas in the kennel are necessary to
maintain the structure and sanitation of the dog housing facility. Proper cleaning and sanitation prevent the spread
of disease.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an accumulation of feces and urine soaked shavings in several of the new pens that are on the ground.
These enclosures are being cleaned weekly, but per this regulation, fecal and food waste must be cleaned daily to
prevent soiling of the dogs. These enclosures must be spot cleaned daily for the health and comfort of the dogs.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The primary housing facility where the dogs were kept needs to be addressed. Throughout the area, there were
excess items, trash, debris and dust. Dust was covering the kennel cages and counter tops where dental
instruments and medications were kept. On one kennel door, there were used syringes covered with safe-guard (a
canine dewormer) which were not being cleaned between use. To maintain the health of the dogs and prevent
disease transmission, it is important to make sure there are proper housekeeping practices of the overall facility andthat instruments (dental or syringes) are cleaned and sanitized to prevent cross contamination when treating
animals.
