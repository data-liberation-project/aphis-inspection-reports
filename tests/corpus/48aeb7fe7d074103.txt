Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
At the time of inspection, the USDA inspector observed enrichment items within enclosures; however, the environmental
enhancement program was not available for inspection. An environmental enhancement plan that documents the
appropriate provisions to provide enrichment and special considerations (such as single-housed non-human primates and
infants) must be directed by the attending veterinarian and available for inspection. This is necessary to ensure the
psychological well-being of the animals. Ensure that a documented plan for environmental enrichment that addresses the
required elements is maintained and available for inspection.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Two enclosures housing 2 and 7 common marmosets respectively had an accumulation of feces on the benches
underneath the feeding and water bowls. The different colors and textures of feces (soft and light brown vs hard and
black) indicated that the feces had not been removed in several days. Excessive build up of feces can be a disease
hazard and attract unwanted pests. Excreta and food waste must be spot cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all
animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta or as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and


odors.
