FEEDING.
* Bird droppings were observed collecting on dog feed being offered to five dogs. The affected food is located in
the food receptacles located on the outdoor flooring that is attached to the sheltered building. Contaminated feed is
not healthy to be consumed and could lead to health issues. The nutritive value of the feed being fed could be
affected when it becomes contaminated. The licensee must ensure that all food must be uncontaminated,
wholesome, palatable and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the normal condition and weight of
the animal. Correct by 12/14/16.

FEEDING.
* Bird droppings were observed collecting on the exterior of four food receptacles. Five dogs are in contact with
the affected receptacles located on the outdoor flooring that is attached to the sheltered building. Food receptacles
not being kept clean could harbor bacteria and other disease-causing agents affecting the health of the dogs. The
licensee must ensure all food receptacles must be located so as to minimize contamination by excreta and pests.

3.10 DIRECT
WATERING.
* Bird droppings were observed collecting in the frozen water and on the exterior of five water receptacles. Five
dogs are in contact with the affected receptacles located on the outside runs that are attached to the sheltered
building. Contaminated water is no longer considered to be safe for the dog to drink and could lead to potential
health risks. It indicates a lack of cleaning and sanitation is occurring to prevent the water from becoming
contaminated. Despite freezing temperatures all animals require potable water to support their health and
well-being. Pregnant or nursing females, young dogs or dogs with medical conditions may need more access to
potable water. Insufficient water can lead to dehydration which reduces the dog’s ability to maintain normal body
functions and could lead to further health risks. The licensee must ensure that water receptacles are kept cleaned
and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b) of this sub part. In addition, the licensee must ensure that potable water
is offered to the dogs as often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being. Correct by 12/14/16.3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The facility has no current effective pest prevention program in place. Bird droppings were observed
accumulating on the outside frame boards of the sheltered building housing 10 dogs. Lack of an effective program
that controls birds can create unsanitary conditions and lead to potential health risks. No means to control or
eliminate the birds were viewed during the inspection. The licensee must establish an effective program for the
control of birds and mammals that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and
well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in the animal areas. Correct by 12/26/16.
* The facility inspection done on 12/12/16 and the exit briefing done on 12/13/16 were conducted with the licensee.
