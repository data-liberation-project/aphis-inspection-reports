ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care did not have complete instruction for the use of Uniprim despite the veterinarian
having previously conveyed the instructions to the facility. Clear instructions are needed to assure that medications
are given in a safe and effective manner. Correct by assuring the attending veterinarian provides adequate
veterinary instructions in a written program of veterinary care (PVC) for all medications in common use. To be

3.31(b)
SANITATION.
The floor of the facility had accumulations of forage and feces of sufficient quantity that they were not the result of
the recent cleaning of primary enclosures. These accumulations outside the primary enclosures can attract pests
and harbor disease that can affect the health of the animals. Correct by assuring premises (buildings and grounds)
are kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in The Code of Federal Regulation 9 (9CFR).
