2.31(e)(3) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
An animal received dermatologic burns due to the use of a heating device during surgery. The device was not approved
for use on the IACUC approved protocol. Lesions on the hindlimb and flank were treated successfully.

An animal died due to the use of a dosing chart not approved for use on the IACUC approved protocol. The approved
chart in the protocol was not used. The unapproved chart resulted in administration of an anticoagulant overdose. The
animal was treated, and appeared stable at the final evening check, but was found dead in the morning.

Deviation from IACUC approved protocols may result in animal injury and death. A proposal to conduct an activity
involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed animal use.
