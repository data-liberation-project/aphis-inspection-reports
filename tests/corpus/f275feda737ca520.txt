3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two primary enclosures on the whelping side of the kennel that have a runner located under the door flap
that is broken and need to be repaired or replaced. These broken plastic runners have one sharp edge that is
exposed that is not held to the wall and is lying upright with a screw in it, and could be an area where the puppies
could crawl between or fall into when trying to climb out the doorway. There are three broken feeders that need to
be replaced, where the long side along the seems are pulled apart. There is a plastic runner along the fence bottom
of the first enclosure holding a Dalmatian female, that is broken at both ends, and there are several plastic
stabilizers' securing the middle fence to the cement that have been broken and are hanging on the fence.
Broken materials inside of the enclosures can be a source of potential injuries due to sharp edges and points from
the pieces of plastic or exposed screws.
The licensee must repair and/or replace any broken structures in the enclosures, including any food receptacles'
being used.
