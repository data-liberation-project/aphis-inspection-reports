** In the pasture that enclosed the cattle and horses there were several piles of discarded bedding that had many
orange strands of hay bale twine and netting mixed in it. In another location where a hay receptacle had been
replaced there was an old broken hay receptacle adjacent to it that needed to be removed from the pasture. There
shall be provisions made to remove and properly dispose of animal waste, bedding, trash and debris from the
general facilities for the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by March 23, 2018.
