HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** One enclosure at the top of the hill housing two hybrids needs to be addressed. The chain link mesh on the
ground of the enclosure is protruding up significantly due to ground erosion in this area. This section of mesh could
be a potential hazard to the animals and needs to be covered over to prevent injury. This needs to be corrected for
the safety of the animals.
