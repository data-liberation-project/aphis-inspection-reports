2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Swine #43-3 was noted to have a very thin body condition. The dorsal spinal processes of the thoracic and
lumbar vertebrae as well as the pelvic bones were very prominent; however the animal’s behavior and level of
activity were similar to the other pigs housed in the same room. Although the pig had eaten all of its food that had
been given earlier that morning, the animal immediately began to eat when additional feed was provided. The
licensee (who is also the AV) confirmed that the present condition of the pig had not been previously recognized
and the animal was not currently under any special treatment.
Per this Section of the Regulations, each dealer shall maintain a program of veterinary care that includes use of
appropriate methods to prevent, diagnose, and treat any problems of animal health. The very thin body condition
observed in this pig is not normal for this species and can indicate an underlying health problem.
The Licensee/AV needs to assess the health status of this pig and address the thin body condition of this animal.
Correct from this date 2/23/18.
