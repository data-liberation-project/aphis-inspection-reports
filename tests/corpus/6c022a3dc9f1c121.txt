ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:45 pm on
02/27/2014. A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection
process.
I attempted to conduct an unannounced inspection and found no one there. I attempted to make contact by phone
but left a message. Please contact me at (240) 731-4240 and update facility status. Thank you.
