SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
At 5 pm, the temperature during the inspection outside of the kennels was 92 deg F. The temperature inside of the
whelping kennel was 89 deg F, with a Heat Index of 103 deg F. The whelping kennel had one small window
(approx. 6in x 12) open and there were no fans turned on to move air. The temperature inside of the second kennel
was 93 deg F, with a Heat Index of 108 deg F. There was no air moving in this second kennel. There was one fan
facing the inside of one primary enclosure containing one dog. The fan was on low, and neither inspector could feel
air movement when they placed their hands in front of the fan. This second kennel had only 1 small window open
(approx. 6in x 12in). The dogs in both sheltered kennels, were panting heavily throughout the inspection. This is a
‘short nosed’ breed that has difficulty moving air and are very susceptible to respiratory distress from heat stress
when environmental temperatures are high. There was a female nursing her pups, who was lying flat out and
panting heavily (signs of heat stress). The neighboring enclosure contained 8 pups that were lying on their back and
side, separated from each other and panting, so they were also showing signs of heat stress.
There were no temperature measuring devices located in either kennel to monitor and keep the temperatures at
their required levels in a sheltered facility according to AWA standards and regulations.
The temperatures for the past several days have been in the upper 80s, low 90s, and will continue to be in the low
90's for the next 7-8 days. We were at the facility at 1130am where the ambient temperature was 92 deg F, no one
was home. When we returned at 4pm, the ambient temperature was still 92 deg F, with no one home until 5pm
when we conducted the inspection.
High temperatures can be a source of discomfort and possible health issues, especially in short nosed breeds, if left
uncontrolled. It is important to have temperature measuring devices in order to monitor the heat/cold in the kennels
for proper regulation of the temperatures.
The sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities for dogs must be sufficiently heated and cooled when necessary to
protect the dogs from temperature or humidity extremes and to provide for their health and well-being. The ambient
temperature must not rise above 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C) for more than 4 consecutive hours when dogs are present
in a sheltered housing facility. There should be a temperature measuring device available to monitor the kennel
temperatures.To be corrected by: September 24, 2017

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an excessive buildup of brown dirt/grime on the vertical bars on the primary enclosures inside, and on the
bars in the outdoor run areas of the whelping barn. This grime could be scratched off of the bars during the
inspection, and needs to be properly cleaned in order to provide a surface that can be sanitized. At this time, the
bars have a coating of dirt that does not allow for proper sanitization.
The buildup of dirt and grime on any surface that comes in contact with the regulated animals can be a possible
source of bacteria and possible health issues if left unclean.
The licensee must clean all of the surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals thoroughly enough to
allow for the enclosure, floors, bars, walls and feeders to be sanitized. All surfaces must be sanitized at least once
every 2 weeks, or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt/grime.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were an excessive amount of flies that were covering all surfaces and animals in the outdoor run area on
both sides of the whelping kennel. The fly tapes under the roof outside on both sides of the barn were completely
full, and there was no other form of fly control being used at this time that is controlling the fly population. There
were multiple fly eggs in the feces in one of the runs.
Excessive numbers of flies can be a possible source of disease and possible health issues if left uncontrolled.
The licensee must provide as much pest control as necessary to prevent the excessive buildup of flies or any pest
that has contact with the regulated animals. When fly tapes are full, they must be removed/replaced as needed to
continue to provide protection for the regulated animals.

Inspection and exit interview was conducted with licensee. The licensee refused to sign the inspection report.
