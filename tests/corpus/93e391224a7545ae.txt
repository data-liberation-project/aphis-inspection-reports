2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:05 am on
18-DEC-17. The gate was locked and no one answered the primary phone number. When I dialed the secondary
number I spoke with an unidentified facility employee who said he would call licensee and have him call me back.
No one called back and several more attempts were made calling both numbers. Only recorded messages were
heard and I left my contact information and reason for calling on both voicemails. We left at 11:45 a.m.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
