ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The male Snow macaque is kept separate from the Celebes male macaque because they don't get along. There is
a female macaque in the enclosure in between the two males.
This type of groping and switching between enclosures is not written and specified in the Environmental Enrichment
plan and at some point one animal is left by himself.
In order to comply with this section of the regulation social grouping has to be addressed in the Environmental
enhancement plan.
To be corrected by 8-30-2016.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
