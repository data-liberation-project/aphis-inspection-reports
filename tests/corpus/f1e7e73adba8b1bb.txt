COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
During a focused inspection conducted August 24, 2017 a puppy was observed drowned in its water bowl. This
small, eight week old, female, American Eskimo puppy was observed singly housed yesterday. Today, it shared an
enclosure with a fully grown, approximately 35 pound, female Shiba Inu mix. The puppy was fully submerged in
blood tinged water, eyes bulging, with agonal convulsions when this inspector pulled her out of the water bowl. It
was too late, she was dead. The puppy had bloody bite wounds on her head and body. The Shiba Inu had blood
on its chest. It is unknown exactly how the puppy ended up in the water bowl, or if she was alive prior to entering
the water. Regardless of these details, clearly this young puppy was attacked by the older adult dog resulting in
her death. Puppies four months of age or less may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs,
other than their dams or foster dams, unless permanently maintained in breeding colonies.
