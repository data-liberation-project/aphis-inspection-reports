ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:54 PM on
19-Mar-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I rang the doorbell of the house located at the facility site. When there was no answer, I
called the business phone number and left a voice mail at 1:54 PM. I honked the horn twice. After waiting for 30
minutes, I left the facility.
