ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:56pm on
07-Oct-19.
The store was locked and no one answered my knocking at the front door. The store appeared to be vacated.
When I attempted to call the licensee, the call goes instantly to a recording that states "I'm sorry, the person you are
trying to reach has a voicemail box that has not been set up yet." It disconnects after the message plays.
