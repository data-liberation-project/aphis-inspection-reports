FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Approximately 30 feet of zoo perimeter fence along White Sands Boulevard was recently damaged by a vehicular
impact. A minimum of ten feet of concrete block was broken and has been removed. Several of the decorative
metal rail sections of the fence were broken or bent in this area as well. A welded wire panel has been temporarily
placed in the perimeter fence gap. At the time of the inspection, it was also noted that there was a minimum of four
fence posts to the north of this damaged section of perimeter fence that were extremely rusted. In the area where
these four decorative metal fence posts attach to the concrete block, much of the metal was rusted away entirely.
The structural integrity of this section of the zoo perimeter fence along White Sands Boulevard has been
compromised to the point where it can no longer function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
zoo. The perimeter fence must be constructed and maintained so that it protects animals in the facility.
To be corrected by: September 30, 2016.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
