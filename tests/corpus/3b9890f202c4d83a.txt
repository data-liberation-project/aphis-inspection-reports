CARE IN TRANSIT.
During this inspection an adult dog identified as a yellow lab in route to London was housed in a primary enclosure
constructed like a kennel run at a holding facility. The dog had been removed from a primary enclosure used for air
transport and placed in the kennel run at IAH while waiting transfer. A horizontal metal support bar at the base of
the kennel door was broken and accessible to the dog. One end of the broken bar had jagged, sharp edges that
could cause injury to the animal.
During transportation in commerce a dog must not be removed from its primary enclosure unless it is placed in
another primary enclosure that meets the requirements of 3.6. under the Animal Welfare Act. Section 3.6 (a)(2)(i)
states that primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that
could cause injury to the dog. Dogs should only be placed in primary enclosures that are maintained in good repair.
This non-compliant item was corrected during the inspection by moving the dog to an alternate run that was
structurally sound and maintained in good repair.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the kennel tech.
