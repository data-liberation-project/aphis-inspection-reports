2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The current written program of veterinary care signed by the attending veterinarian on 6/26/15 is incomplete. It
does not list/include all species currently at the facility (exhibit goats, kinkajou, marmoset). There is a lack of detail
in regard to the preventative care recommendations for all species. For example, for ectoparasite and internal
parasite control for wild/exotic animals it simply states "2x a year". For domestic species there are no
recommendations for external parasite control and for internal parasite control it states (cid:28)2x a year(cid:29). It is unclear as to
whether this refers to treatment and if so with what medications/dosages or if it refers to sampling/testing
recommendations. The euthanasia recommendations are also incomplete: for wild/exotic species it states "injection"
but does not state what type of injection and for the domestic species there are no recommendations. There are
also no vaccination recommendations for the exhibit animals.
*In addition, the veterinarian has not made been to the facility for a regularly scheduled visit since June 2015. The
written program of veterinary care states the veterinarian will visit three times a year. Animals in need of veterinary
care and appropriate husbandry care have been identified.
Lack of detail in the written program of veterinary care can lead to lack of adequate veterinary care for the animals.
The facility shall, with their attending veterinarian, complete a written program of veterinary care that includes all
aspects of veterinary care needed for the animals at the facility and the veterinarian shall make regularly scheduled
visits to the facility.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The facility houses four prairie dogs. At least three are missing hair in patches. One has hairloss over its shoulder
area, along its right side and around its tail area. One is missing hair on its tail. A third is missing hair over its lower
back/tailhead area.
The veterinarian has not yet been contacted regarding the prairie dogs and their haircoat issues. To ensure
appropriate diagnosis and treatment, the veterinarian needs to be involved in diagnosis and treatment
recommendations. The prairie dogs shall be examined by a veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. 2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*There were no records of acquisition for the kinkajou and marmoset acquired since the last inspection.
*The disposition records reviewed were missing the date of sale/disposition for several hedgehogs.
Complete acquisition and disposition records are required to allow legal and medical tracking of the animals. The
facility shall make and keep complete acquisition records for all mammals and complete disposition records for all
the exotic mammals species. Correct by April 1, 2016.

2.131(e) DIRECT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
One adult grey rabbit in a wire and plastic enclosure the outdoor "rabbit greenhouse type building" was noted to be
breathing rapidly and shallowly. Its nostrils were flaring during the respiration. The temperature was measured
inside with Kestrel at 87 degrees F. The building felt warm and stuffy with no ventilation. The door was opened and
just the breeze through the open door appeared to help improve airflow immediately. Rabbits are very susceptible to
overheating. A temperature of 87 with lack of ventilation appears to be too high for this rabbit leading to a threat to
it's well-being. The facility shall take measures immediately to ensure that climatic conditions present are not a
threat to the rabbit's health and well-being.
3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One of the rabbit enclosures in the 'rabbit house structure' is showing significant amounts of rust along the metal
wire sides and/or floors of the enclosure. It houses one adult rabbit. The enclosure is made of a solid plastic bottom
piece with white coated wire sides and top. The white coated wire sections closest to the junction with the plastic
bottom are affected the worst. One corner is broken and has been repaired with wire. Rusty wire cannot be
adequately cleaned and sanitized. Rusty wire also becomes a hazard to the rabbits leading to potential injury when
the rust leads to structural instability of the wire. Enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to protect the rabbits.
3.53(a)(5) DIRECT REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES. Two rabbit enclosures in the "rabbit green house structure" contain recently born young rabbits. Each has three
offspring. One group was born on 3/3/16 and the other was born approximately 2/25/16 according to the calendar
record. In both cases the young rabbits are huddled in one corner of the enclosure on the wood shavings. There is
no nest box in the enclosures for the mother rabbit to use to build her nest. Nest boxes are necessary to provide the
young offspring a clean and sheltered environment for the first month of their life. A suitable nest box containing
clean nesting material shall be provided in each enclosure housing a female with a litter less than a month of age.
3.56(c)
SANITATION.
The screens above the concrete rabbit enclosures and the areas around these rabbit enclosures in the "rabbit green
house structure" building need to be cleaned. There is old dry rabbit excreta present on the screens and around the
enclosures. Old accumulated excreta can lead to spread of disease, odors and attract pests. The screens and areas
around the rabbit enclosures shall be cleaned and all debris removed. Correct by March 21, 2016.
3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The facility has acquired a marmoset since the last inspection. The enclosure currently housing the marmoset was
not designed specifically for a marmoset. There is wire with openings approximately 1 inx1in making up a portion of
the ceiling over two light/heat bulbs. The marmoset was noted placing her hand through the opening toward the
bulb. The two bulbs are immediately above the wire and within reach of the marmoset. The marmoset may be
injured by touching the bulbs and if the bulbs explode/break glass shards may fall on the marmoset.
The enclosure is accessed by employees from the front via a full size sliding window. Food is placed in the
enclosure and the enclosure is cleaned via this window. The window is large enough that the marmoset could
escape while it is open to allow for cleaning and feeding.
Enclosures for non-human primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the
species contained in them including protecting the animals from injury and escape. Correct by April 1, 2016.
3.80(a)(2)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosure currently housing the marmoset was made by the facility of a gunnite like material. The walls are
made to look rocklike/natural. There are many tiny cracks and crevices. in the walls. One section on the upper half
of the wall on the left side has hundreds of tiny "bumps" in its surface. This area is not easily cleanable/sanitizable.
In addition, all surfaces need to be impervious to moisture to allow cleaning. Regular cleaning and sanitization is
necessary to prevent accumulation of debris, odors and pests and to help with disease prevention. Primary
enclosures for non-human primates must be constructed such that all surfaces in contact with the animals can bereadily cleaned and sanitized in accordance with 3.84(b)(3). Correct by April 1, 2016.
3.81 DIRECT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility acquired a marmoset approximately a couple of weeks ago. The facility representative states they have
not yet read the regulations regarding non-human primates and have not developed a plan of environmental
enrichment. The marmoset is currently a singly housed non-human primate with no visual or auditory interaction
with any other non-human primates or any other animal species. The enclosure does include climbing structures
and a mirror. The facility representative states the owner interacts with the marmoset in the evenings. Non-human
primates are extremely social animals, especially the marmoset who live in multi-animal groups. The facility needs
to develop a plan for how they are going to meet this animal's needs for social and environmental enrichment using
currently accepted professional standards and with the direction of their attending veterinarian. This plan must be in
accordance with currently accepted professional standards and must be in writing and must specifically at a
minimum address social grouping, environmental enrichment and all special considerations. Correct by April 1,
2016.
3.82(d)
FEEDING.
The marmoset food receptacles and food are currently fed on the lower floor levels of the enclosure. Marmosets are
arboreal species and do not eat on the ground. In addition, when the marmoset urinates and defecates while in the
upper parts of the enclosure, the waste may fall into and onto the food contaminating the food. Food and food
receptacles must be located so as to minimize any risk of contamination by excreta. Correct by April 1, 2016.
3.130
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the prairie dogs needs to be cleaned. The water Is discolored brown with brown and white
debris floating in it. The debris almost has a white moldy appearance to a part of it suggesting it has been there for
several days. The receptacle itself also is dirty. Clean water receptacles with potable water are necessary to ensure
the animals have access to potable water. Correct immediately and from this day forward.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
