ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current written program of veterinary care signed by the attending veterinarian on 6/26/15 is incomplete. It does
not list/include all species currently at the facility (exhibit goats). There is a lack of detail in regard to the
preventative care recommendations for all species. For example, for ectoparasite and internal parasite control for
wild/exotic animals it simply states "2x a year". For domestic species there are no recommendations for external
parasite control and for internal parasite control it states (cid:28)2x a year(cid:29). It is unclear as to whether this refers to
treatment and if so with what medications/dosages or if it refers to sampling/testing recommendations. The
euthanasia recommendations are also incomplete: for wild/exotic species it states "injection" but does not state
what type of injection and for the domestic species there are no recommendations. There are also no vaccination
recommendations for the exhibit animals. Lack of detail in the written program of veterinary care can lead to lack of
adequate veterinary care for the animals. The facility shall, with their attending veterinarian, complete a written
program of veterinary care that includes all aspects of veterinary care needed for the animals at the facility. Correct
by 12/23/15.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One black micro pig housed in the rabbit house is missing hair over its lower back and has large flakes of skin
present in this same area. No documentation of veterinary care was available for review. Facility representative was
unsure if the pig had been seen by a veterinarian but the pig is not currently on any treatment. Hairloss and flaking
skin can be signs of disease or nutritional deficiencies. Untreated skin problems can progress and lead to more
severe infections and can cause discomfort to the animals. A veterinarian needs to be consulted to obtain a
diagnosis and treatment plan for the pig's skin problem. Correct by 11/30/15.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The "rabbit house structure" consists of rounded plastic type material stretched over a frame. This provides shelterfrom wind, rain and direct sunlight. Nine rabbit enclosures are in this structure. There is no working heater or
alternative heat source. None of the rabbit enclosures has any shelter structure provided to help keep the rabbits
warm by preserving body heat. Seven of the enclosures house a single adult rabbit. The other two enclosures each
house two rabbits and young baby rabbits one of which appear to be newly born. The local temperature last night
was 28.5 degrees F. Temperatures below 40 degrees F for rabbits can lead to discomfort and hypothermia. This is
especially true for the young and newly born rabbits. Shelter shall be provided for all rabbits kept outdoors when the
temperature falls below 40 degrees F. Correct by 11/24/15.
3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Four of the rabbit enclosures in the 'rabbit house structure' are showing significant amounts of rust along the metal
wire sides and/or floors of the enclosure. Each houses one adult rabbit. One enclosure is made of a solid plastic
bottom piece with white coated wire sides and top. The white coated wire sections closest to the junction with the
plastic bottom are affected. The other three enclosures are made of uncoated metal wire. The wire bottoms and
corners of all three enclosures are pitted with rust. The left side enclosure, when standing at the front, has wires that
have been eaten away from the rust creating sharp rusty metal points on which the rabbit can injure itself. Rusty
wire cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Rusty wire also becomes a hazard to the rabbits leading to
potential injury when the rust leads to structural instability of the wire. Enclosures shall be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits. Correct by 11/30/15.
3.53(a)(5) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One rabbit enclosure in the 'rabbit house structure' houses two adult rabbits. In the far back corner, on top of the
dirty shavings, is a new accumulation of plucked hair made by the adult female for her offspring. There is no nest
box in the enclosure for her to use to build her nest. Nest boxes are necessary to provide the young offspring a
clean and sheltered environment for the first month of their life. A suitable nest box containing clean nesting material
shall be provided in each enclosure housing a female with a litter less than a month of age. Correct by 11/24/15.
3.56(a)(2)
SANITATION.
The rabbit enclosure in the 'rabbit house structure' housing two adults and six young rabbits is in need of cleaning.
The litter in the back portion of the enclosure is visibly soiled. It is wet and has accumulated fecal material. One of
the rabbits was sitting in this wet area which will lead to soiling of the rabbit's haircoat. There is a strong rabbit urine
odor noted when standing in front of this enclosure. The facility representative states that the enclosures arecleaned out every 2-3 weeks with soiled litter occasionally spot cleaned inbetween as the enclosure is difficult to
reach to clean the way it is designed. Soiled litter shall be removed and replaced with clean litter at least once each
week. Correct by 11/25/15.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Two new exhibit goats are in an outdoor enclosure. There are some trees/shrubs in the rocky sloped enclosure but
leaves have fallen so they do not provide adequate shelter from rain, storms, wind or cold and there is no artificial
shelter structure provided. The temperature last night dropped to 28.5 degrees F. Shelter from inclement weather
appropriate to the local climatic conditions shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection
and to prevent discomfort to the animals. Correct by 11/30/15.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The facility currently houses two goats in a small outdoor enclosure. The ground is bare and rocky and little to no
natural browse is present. No hay was noted in the enclosure. The facility representative stated that the goats were
fed goat feed. The feed inspected was stored in a lidded trash can and appeared to be an all stock type pelleted
feed. The inspector asked if the goats were fed hay and was told that the employees hadn't fed them any hay today
but the owner might do it when she was there. The owner was off yesterday and is off today. Goats require
adequate fiber/roughage levels to maintain their health. All food shall be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain the animals in good health. The diet shall be prepared with consideration for age, species, condition, size
and type of animal. The facility shall consult with their attending veterinarian to ensure that the diet fed to the goats
is appropriate for maintenance of good health. Correct by 11/30/15.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
