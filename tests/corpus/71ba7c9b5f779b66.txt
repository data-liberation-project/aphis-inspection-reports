Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult white, tan, and brown guinea pig was observed to have a right eye that is markedly shrunken to the extent where
it is approximately 50% obscured by the third eyelid. The portion of the eye that is still visible was opaque and discolored
red/yellow with an opaque white center. Abnormalities of the right eye of this guinea pig were initially observed during a
previous inspection that occurred on May 20, 2021. At that time, the licensee was instructed to have the Attending
Veterinarian examine the guinea pig.

In a separate pen, an adult black, tan, and white guinea was observed to have a right eye that is markedly dry and thick,
green mucous is observed both on the eye and the eyelids. The upper eyelid of this eye has a large patch of ulcerated
skin and is markedly swollen in appearance. Abnormalities of the right eye of this guinea pig were also observed on the
May 20, 2021 inspection and the licensee was likewise instructed to have this animal examined by the Attending
Veterinarian.

The licensee stated that following the May 20, 2021 inspection, he did contact the Attending Veterinarian regarding the
guinea pigs' eye issues but did not have the Attending Veterinarian examine the animals. No further attempts were made


to discuss the need for a veterinary exam or the continuation of the eye conditions.

Licensees are required to have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with their Attending Veterinarian so
that timely and accurate information on animal health issues can be addressed. Failure to do so can cause the animals
pain or even lead to death when conditions are left untreated. Correct by having both animals examined by the Attending
Veterinarian so that proper treatment can be administered and by maintaining communication with the Attending
Veterinarian regarding all future animal health concerns.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
