2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There are 205 adult dogs present at the facility with only 155 adults dogs listed on the APHIS Form 7005 (Record of
Acquisition and Dogs on Hand). Of the 50 dogs missing from the Record of Animals on Hand, twenty-eight are present at
the facility for breeding purposes. The facility has not been maintaining a Record of Disposition (APHIS form 7006) for any
of the dogs that it has been acquiring short-term for breeding. Incomplete or inaccurate records do not allow for APHIS
officials to assess the welfare of animals being cared for at the facility. The applicant must ensure that records or forms
fully and correctly disclose all animals acquired, transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or
exhibitor. The records must include all animals that are owned, held, or otherwise in the possession or under their control
including those that are only present at the facility for a short time for outside breeding.

Housing facilities, general.
There are several areas with excessive chew damage on the resting platforms and the step to the flap style metal doors
on the inside of the kennel. There is chew and scratch damage on the concrete floor paint on the inside of the primary
enclosures resulting in peeling and bubbling. There are also areas with excessive chew damage to the vinyl siding on the
inside portion of the outdoor runs Areas containing chew and scratch damage are not able to be properly cleaned and
sanitized and can lead to disease or injury. Correct by ensuring that all surfaces in the housing facility including houses,

dens, and other furniture-type objects within the facility that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced
when worn or soiled.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is conducting progesterone testing and Artificial insemination procedures on dogs that are owned by the
facility and that come in for breeding purposes. The progesterone testing and Artificial insemination protocols are not
outlined in the program of veterinary care. Conducting veterinary procedures without oversight by the attending
veterinarian can cause a threat to the welfare of the dogs. The applicant must ensure that the attending veterinarian has
authorized, developed, and document in writing all requirements for adequate veterinary care.
3.13(b)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The 28 dogs at the facility for breeding purposes do not have medical records. The applicant stated that the animals are
only at the facility for a short time to breed and that he was unaware of the requirement to have medical records on dogs
that he does not own. Missing or incomplete medical records on dogs housed at the facility does not allow for APHIS
officials to ensure that the dogs have received proper veterinary care and can subject the kennel to disease exposure.
Correct by ensuring that a medical record including vaccinations, preventative medical procedures, and treatments are
kept for all dogs housed at the facility.
