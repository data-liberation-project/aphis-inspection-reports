2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
There are no public barrier fences to prevent the public from having direct contact with animals in some of the enclosures
at the facility:
The primary enclosure containing one camel, one Asiatic water buffalo, four goats and one yak is built of fencing through
which the public can insert fingers, hands or arms to touch or feed the animals inside. There are pens and an alley
(across a large open area from the Camel pen) to which multiple other animals have access (including a zebra) which
also are constructed with openings that would allow human-animal contact and with no public barriers to prevent such
contact. The lack of public barriers in these areas poses a risk of injury for humans and animals.
During public exhibition, the licensee must ensure that there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of
animals and the public.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.


There is no true perimeter fence for part(s) of the facility because the outermost fence intended to serve as the perimeter
fence (along the shoulder of NM State Highway 130) is also the back fence of the primary enclosure containing one
camel, one Asiatic water buffalo, four goats and one yak. Lack of a true perimeter fence cannot prevent the public from
having direct contact with the animals, which poses a risk of injury for both people and the animals inside the enclosure.
Additionally, this fence cannot serve as secondary containment for escaped animals.
The licensee must ensure that a perimeter fence or fences of at least six feet in height (for the species inventoried at the
time of inspection) is/are in place around the facility, at least three feet in distance from the walls of any primary
enclosure. The perimeter fence(s) must be constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals and the public by
restricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the
animals in the facility.
