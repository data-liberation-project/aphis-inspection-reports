PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Currently the dogs traveling with the show are housed in enclosures that for some of them based on size do not
meet the primary enclosure requirement. The enclosures for the standard poodles are 12 square feet (48 in X 36.5
in). Dog # 9704 or “Dastin” is 38 in X 33 in and requires a primary enclosure that is 13.4 square feet. These
enclosures need to be addressed to meet the required space per the mathematical calculation in this section of the
regulations for each dog listed on record. This needs to be addressed for the comfort of the dogs.
