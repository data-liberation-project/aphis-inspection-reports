ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:20 pm on
06-Oct-16.
In addition to waiting 30 minutes, I called the phone number provided, knocked on the door and honked my vehicle
horn to see if a responsible adult was available.
