ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Brown male Cocker Spaniel with USDA tag #114 has a hazy left eye. The eye appears larger than the right and
protrudes. A light grey/blue haziness makes examination of the deeper structures of the eye difficult. Eye
conditions are painful and if untreated may affect the dog's vision. Licensee must use appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian
for diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and plan shall be
maintained for examination by APHIS officials.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Carpets in the whelping room are worn and soiled. The edges of the carpets are frayed such that long strings are
exposed. Shorter pieces of the carpet are loose in the enclosure. If ingested, these strings may cause serious
health complications. The stainless steel bowls in the whelping room are bent with sharp edges. The sharp points
may cause injury to the animals. Several of the feeders in the outdoor housing area are chewed. The edges are
frayed such that pieces of plastic have frayed off and the edges are rough. These rough edges may cause injury
and cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized. The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in a manner
and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed/replaced when worn or
soiled.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Hair and organic debris is accumulated underneath the suspended floor of the outdoor kennel. Also, the wash
down is stained and has multiple mineral deposits. These accumulations harbor bacteria, create strong odors and
attract pests which is detrimental to the health of the animals. Surfaces of the facility must be cleaned and sanitizedwhen necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The back wall of several of the outdoor enclosures including the dog door that separates the den box from the dog
run is coated with a layer of dark brown organic material. There are also dusty cobwebs in the corners of some of
the den boxes. Dirt and organic debris may harbor disease hazards. Primary enclosures must be cleaned and
sanitized as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease
hazards.
