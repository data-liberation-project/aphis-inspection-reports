2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The inspector acquired information that the licensee was housing the regulated dogs at an address other than what is
documented on the application for license and/or is an approved site. Upon arriving at the new address the inspector
spoke to the facility representative who stated the dogs were removed from "Site 001" around 24-January-2022 and were
then housed at multiple locations. The dogs were moved to their current location approximately six weeks prior to 26-
July-2022 . The licensee has not provided APHIS officials any of the locations where the dogs have been housed since
their removal from "Site 001" in January. The facility representative stated that the current address has not been provided
to APHIS as the facility is not compliant and would not pass an inspection. Per the facility representative, thirteen adult
French bulldogs and 15 puppies are housed at the location.

Failure to provide addresses of locations housing regulated animals interferes with the ability of APHIS officials to locate
the animals and to enforce the Animal Welfare Act which could result in animals housed and/or subjected to non-
compliant conditions.

A licensee shall notify Animal Care no fewer than 90 days and obtain a new license before any change in the name,
address, management, substantial control or ownership of his business or operation, locations, activities, and number or

type of animals. The licensee must provide to APHIS officials the address of the location(s) that all regulated dogs are
currently housed and maintained.

To be corrected by: From this day forward all locations housing regulated animals must be provided to APHIS officials.
