FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***From the parking lot of the facility, a goat was noticed sticking its head through the space between barb wires
located above the perimeter/primary enclosure fence. It was determined that a climbing structure had been built
against the inside of the fence. The height of the platform was such that a goat could extend its head over the fence
and possibly escape from the enclosure. There is also a potential for injury from the barb wire. A primary enclosure
should be constructed in a manner that prevents escape and injury. Modifications must be made to the fence or
climbing structure to prevent an animal from extending its head over the perimeter / primary enclosure fence to
contain the animals and prevent injury. Correct by May 31, 2014.
This is a focused inspection to evaluate veterinary care.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
