SANITATION.
Large amounts of several kinds of trash was observed in all of the savannahs. This trash was confined to the areas
adjacent to the Animal Kingdom Lodge guest rooms that overlook the savannahs. This trash appears to have been
dropped/thrown off from the guest balconies onto the ground underneath.
This trash consisted of: pieces of gum, many cigarette butts, a cigarette, plastic bags and other plastic wrappers,
and a ink cartridge from a pen.
This types of trash can pose a risk of ingestion & injury to the animals in these savannahs. Additionally, a lighted
cigarette that is dropped/thrown to the ground can also pose a risk of fire & smoke from the grass, trees, &
vegetation; and places the animals that are in these areas in danger of fire and smoke inhalation.
All cigarettes shall not pose a risk of fire and smoke, and smoking shall not be done in close proximity to the
animals areas or flammable materials. All trash shall also be quickly picked up and removed so as not to pose of
risk of ingestion and injury. Premises shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury.
