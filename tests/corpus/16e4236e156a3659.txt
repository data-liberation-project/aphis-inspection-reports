ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Inspector arrival to premise at 1310 hours. I called the primary contact number and left a message. I honked the car
horn several times. I then went to the kennel office building and knocked on the door. After no answer, I went back
to the car, honked the horn, and moved the car to southwest side of house area to wait the designated time. At
1323, I saw a kennel employee walking from another kennel building toward the kennel office. I drove over to the
kennel office and asked the employee if the licensee was there, The kennel worker affirmed the licensee was
inside. I identified my self and asked the kennel employee to please let the licensee know I was outside waiting to
do a facility inspection. Gary (licensee) came from the kennel office and spoke with me at approx 1325. Licensee
was cordial and stated that he did not have time for an inspection today and had a lot of work to do in the kennel.
Licensee further stated that they had a lot going on and he did not know when they would be available again to do
an inspection. I explained to the licensee that not allowing an inspector to conduct an inspection could be
considered a refusal to allow inspection. Licensee stated that he did not like the refusal terminology but that he
could not do an inspection. I repeated my request to do an inspection and the licensee stated he could not do an
inspection. I told the licensee that I would have to consider his answer as a refusal to allow inspection and asked if
he understood that I would be issuing a non-compliance for not allowing for inspection. Licensee acknowledged that
he understood that I would be issuing a citation due to refusal of inspection by the licensee.
I left the premise at 1329.
