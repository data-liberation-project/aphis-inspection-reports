***** At time of inspection the white female pig in the third pen from the west end of the pig enclosures had injured
her left rear leg. She was reluctant to put her full weight on it when walking and had a noticable limp to her gate.
She also had several abrasions on her left flank which may be from rubbing or could have been sustained at time of
the injury to her left leg.
This animal needs to be taken to a veterinarian by close of business tomorrow for an evaluation and treatment
recommendation from the veterinarian. A line of communication to keep the veterinarian appraised of the animals
recovery progress should be established and followed until the animal has recovered.
