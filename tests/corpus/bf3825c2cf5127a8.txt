3.127(d) Critical Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
On the night of December 28th or morning of December 29th at least three stray dogs managed to gain entry to the park
and attack and kill a total of four facility animals. Three barbary sheep and a single wallaby died from the attack. One
male barbary was in a quarantine pen well separated from the remainder of the zoo animals. The other barbary sheep
were in their regular primary enclosure, and the wallaby was in its primary enclosure near the center of the facility. No
other animals appear to have been injured during the attack.
There appear to be several potential areas on the perimeter fence which might have been used by the dogs to gain entry.
Two accessory gates on the west side of the facility next to the concrete drainage ditch have small gaps at the bottom
which could likely be used by canids. There was also a freshly dug hole under the fence next to the drainage ditch on the
southeast side of the facility close to the quarantine pen large enough to admit a medium or large dog.
The quarantine pen itself had several spots that showed fresh digging underneath the enclosure fence. The main barbary
sheep pen also had a fresh dig spot into the enclosure. The fence at this point was bent upwards as well. There were no
obvious entry points into the wallaby enclosure, and it is likely that the dogs scaled the fence, which is chain link several
feet high topped with several strands of thick braided wire.
The dogs were seen in the facility by at least two employees arriving for morning feeding. One keeper spotted at least


one dog in the wallaby area between the enclosure fence and the public barrier. She reported that the dog jumped or
climbed over the public barrier fence and the group ran towards the western border of the facility. She did not see how or
where the dogs escaped from the premises.
A perimeter fence must prevent people and animals from going over or under it to gain access to the facility. The fence at
this facility is chain panel topped with strands of barbed wire, likely sufficient to prevent climbing. Given the presence of
several possible entry routes under the fence, its likely the dogs entered and exited under the fence. The facility must
ensure the perimeter fence is adequately designed to prevent unwanted access by humans and animals and must
regularly inspect the perimeter to identify and address potential problem areas.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
