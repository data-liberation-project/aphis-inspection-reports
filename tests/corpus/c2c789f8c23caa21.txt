09-May-18.
On Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at approximately 11:30 am, a responsible person was not available to conduct an
inspection. Inspector spoke to Mrs. King at the facility. Mr. King was not at home and she was unable to
accompany inspection today due to out of town visitors expected to arrive within an hour. We established optimal
hours of inspection as Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday afternoons. Please call inspector's cell phone if availability
changes. This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this day forward
