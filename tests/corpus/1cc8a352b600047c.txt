2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
Two employees were observed handling rabbits to remove them from their enclosures and to weigh them. One
employee held the rabbit by the ears when carrying the rabbit and was observed picking the rabbit by the skin on
the back No support was given to the rabbit when picking it up and placing it on the scale. A second employee
placed a rabbit on a small table and briefly left the room .Holding the animal by the ears and by the skin on the back
is not a proper way to handle a rabbit. Rabbits are known to kick violently which may result in a severe back injury
when they are not supported propely while being carried or handled. A rabbit left alone and loose on a table is at
risk of jumping off the table . Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort . All employees who work with the animals must be instructed in proper handling
techniques to avoid causing unnecessary discomfort or harm to the animals.
