ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:55 PM on
04-FEB-20.
Arrived at facility and called contact number, left a message. Saw facility personnel and talked to them - in the
process of canceling, will not renew AWA license with only domestic farm animals. Received a call back from
licensee, discussed attempted inspection for today and how to cancel the exhibitor license.
