ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1322 on
01-Nov-17. I went to the licensee's house. No one was home. I contacted the licensee by phone and she informed
me no one was available for inspection. She gave me her optimal hours. I told her I would try back another time.
End of report.
