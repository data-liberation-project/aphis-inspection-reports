3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the two small dog buildings the enclosures are framed in wood and there are at least nine enclosures, containing
fourteen dogs, which have the sharp ends of screws penetrating through the wood framing and into the dog
enclosures. The screws are located in the wood that is framing the top of the enclosures and the dogs could come
into contact with the sharp points.

Multiple sharp points are located in at least three outdoor enclosures, containing four Golden retrievers. The sharp
points are found at the level of the dogs and are created by the ends of wires that are used to attach buckets and
feeders to the fence and along some of the enclosure fence panels. Sharp points can cause injury to the dogs.
Housing facilities for dogs must be free of sharp points and jagged edges that could injure the animals. The
licensee must remove the sharp points from the dog enclosures in order to eliminate the injury risk towards the
dogs. The licensee must ensure that all housing facilities remain safe for the dogs at all times.

3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the two small dog buildings there are at least sixteen enclosures, containing twenty dogs, that are framed in wood
and the wood along the tops of the enclosures has been chewed and shredded by the dogs.

The outdoor enclosures housing the Golden retrievers have shelters with flaps over the doors that act as wind and
rain breaks. At least three of the flaps have been shredded and torn by the dogs. At least three dogs are housed in
these enclosures.
The outdoor enclosures each contain a shelter for the dogs. In one enclosure, containing two Golden retrievers, the
floor of the shelter is constructed of wooden boards and the dogs have damaged the wood resulting in a large holein the floor.
The damage to the wood and the shelter flaps does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of these surfaces
to occur and could increase the disease risk towards the dogs.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must
be replaced if worn or soiled. The licensee must replace the damaged wood and shelter flaps or alter them in a
manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces
of housing facilities are maintained and kept in good repair.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is one outdoor enclosure, containing one Golden retriever, which has no wind and rain break at the entrance
to the shelter. Another enclosure, containing one Golden retriever, has just one small strip remaining of the flap that
covers the entrance to the shelter. Wind and rain breaks located at the shelter entrance are necessary to ensure
that the dog can adequately escape uncomfortable weather.
All outdoor housing shelters must be provided with a wind and rain break at the entrance. The licensee must add a
sufficient wind and rain break to the front of the shelters. The licensee must ensure that all outdoor shelters have a
wind and rain break at all times for the health and well-being of the dogs.

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In at least two outdoor enclosures, containing three Golden retrievers, there is a thick buildup of dirt on the interior
walls of the shelters. In the enclosure containing two young adult Golden retrievers there is also a buildup of dirt on
the wooden floor of the enclosure. The buildup of dirt could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures for dogs must be sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more often if necessary to
prevent the buildup of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The licensee must remove the
buildup of dirt from the interior surfaces of the shelters. The licensee must ensure that the buildup of dirt on the
surfaces of all used primary enclosures is eliminated for the health and well-being of the dogs.
