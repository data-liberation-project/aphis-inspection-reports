3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
There were 4 guinea pig pens that did not provide the required amount of floor space. There was one pen with 17 adult
guinea pigs and 3 pens with 23, 25, and 26 weanling guinea pigs. The pens measured 48 by 24 inches or 1,152 square
inches of floor space. Each adult requires a minimum of 101 square inches of floor space and each weanling requires a
minimum of 60 square inches of floor space. Total floor space required to house 17 adults is 1,717 square inches and
total floor space required to house 23, 25, and 26 weanlings is 1,380, 1,500, and 1,560 square inches respectively. There
cannot be more than 11 adult and 19 weanling guinea pigs housed in an enclosure measuring 48 by 24 inches.
Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, and aggression in animals.
The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs are provided with the minimum amount of floor space in order to avoid
overcrowding and to support the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.
