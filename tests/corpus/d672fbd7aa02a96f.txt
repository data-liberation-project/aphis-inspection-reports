A brown goat that was noted by the inspectors on the inspection of 12-16-14 as lame and having difficulty moving
still appeared to be having difficulty walking. The goat moved stiffly and seemed hesitant to move or place weight
on its right rear leg. This goat had been seen by the attending veterinarian according to the facility president. It was
diagnosed with arthritis and given an injection of cortisone according to the facility president. This had helped the
goat according to the facility president. This goat requires evaluation by the attending veterinarian and additional
treatment to alleviate its pain and suffering. This goat is to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian by close of
business on 2-11-15.
The tiger known as Sher Kahn was very hesitant to stand. When he did stand the muscles of all of his legs were
trembling and the tiger appeared to be very weak. The tiger moved very slowly and stiffly. The tiger had not eaten
any of its food from the night before. The facility president was aware of this animals condition and stated that the
animal was old and had arthritis. This tiger was not on any treatment according to the facility president. This tiger is
suffering in its current condition. This tiger requires evaluation by the attending veterinarian for treatment to
alleviate its pain and suffering. This tiger is to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian by close of business on
2-11-15.
The macaque known as Huey had a wound on the tip of its tail. This lesion was about 1/2 inch long and was red
and raw. Tail wounds of this nature can spread rapidly if not treated in a timely fashion as the animal will continue
to pick at this area. This can lead to infection which can ultimately require tail tip amputation. Wounds must be
treated promptly to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering. This monkey requires evaluation by the attending
veterinarian for treatment. This monkey is to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian by close of business on
2-11-15.
Documentation of the veterinary evaluation for these animals with treatment recommendations and records must be
maintained and available for review by APHIS officials.2.40(b)(3) REPEAT

The macaque known as Huey had a wound on the tip of its tail. This lesion was about 1/2 inch long and was red
and raw. Tail wounds of this nature can spread rapidly if not treated in a timely fashion as the animal will continue
to pick at this area. This can lead to infection which can ultimately require tail tip amputation. No one at the facility
had noticed the condition of this monkey. Failure to observe health issues and promptly report them to the
attending veterinarian will lead to unnecessary suffering and in extreme cases even possible animal death.
Thorough daily observations of all animals should be made. Animals with known problems should receive extra
scrutiny. Report all health issues promptly to the veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Oranges with white mold spots, deteriorating radishes, softening
apples, molding ginger, molding cheese, deteriorating squash and peppers along with other spoiling produce were
all present in the produce cooler. Spoiled produce must be removed promptly to prevent contamination of food
intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce promptly. This cooler needs to be cleaned and
have spoiled and deteriorating items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will be fed to the
animals.
The produce sorting area of the produce cooler contained two chainsaws that had been used to butcher the
previous day. These saws were covered in blood and tissue. These saws must be cleaned and sanitized promptly
after use. They should not be stored in the produce cooler where it is possible for the material on them or the gas
and oil in them to contaminate produce intended for animal feed.
The meat cooler had a horrible ammonia like odor mixed with the odor of rotten and decaying meat. This odor
makes it very hard to determine if the meat items stored in this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the
cooler, identify the source of the odor and eliminate it.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelter for the enclosures housing the three alpacas has no bedding. The enclosure for the shelter housing the
lama has no bedding. The enclosure for the shelter housing one sheep and four goats has no bedding. The
enclosure housing the white tiger has very little bedding. The expected low temperature in the area is 12 degrees
tonight. Adequate bedding must be provided to keep these animals from experiencing unnecessary discomfort.
Provide these animals with bedding in their shelters.3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The enclosure containing the three alpacas and the enclosure containing four goats and one sheep each had a
large pan of dog food in them. Feeding a diet not intended to be fed to these animals could lead to digestive issues
or nutritional deficits. Feed a diet that is adequate to meet the nutritional needs of these animals. Consult with the
attending veterinarian if needed.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The enclosure housing three alpacas contained excessive fecal material in its shelter. The shelter for the cougar
enclosure contained a large amount of food waste. Some of this food waste had been pulled down into the rodent
holes in this shelter. The white tiger enclosure contained excessive food waste. These enclosures need to be
cleaned on a more frequent basis. Uneaten food must be removed in a timely fashion. Food debris can
contaminate the animal enclosures and serve to attract rodents which are numerous throughout the facility. The
fecal material and food waste present in these animals'(cid:25) enclosures can contaminate these animals as they lay in
their enclosures. The animals can ingest this material when they groom themselves. Ingesting this fecal and food
waste can lead to potential health problems. Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of fecal
material and rotting food waste to minimize odors and prevent potential health problems.

SANITATION.
The butcher area had been used yesterday and was not cleaned. The floor was covered with blood and cow feces.
The band saw was covered in animal tissue. The counter was covered in blood. A knife and cutting board were on
the counter and also covered with blood. The facility president stated that no hot water was available as it was
frozen. Fix the water supply and clean the butcher area or bring in water to clean and sanitize it. This area must be
cleaned promptly after use. The animal tissue and blood can serve to attract rodent pest which are numerous
throughout the facility.
The alleyway leading to the butcher area as well as the buildings along this alleyway are filled with various trash,
debris, fencing, pipe and old equipment. The building next to the butcher area is also filled with various debris, old
equipment, boards, trash, buckets, tires and fencing. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other
pests. Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Mouse feces was seen in the warm room area.
All this material must be removed to help control the rodent infestation of this property.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION. Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were noted in the service area and in an
empty animal enclosure located on leopard row. Rodent holes were noted in the service area for the lion and tiger
JJ's enclosures. Numerous rodent holes were seen in the grain storage barn for the hoof stock area. An empty bag
in this building appeared to have been chewed on. Rodent holes were also seen inside the den area for the cougar
enclosure. Excess food waste in the cougar enclosure looked as if it had been pulled down into the rodent holes.
Mouse feces was seen by the inspectors in an empty animal enclosure in the warm room. Rodents can be carriers
of disease which may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of pest control
must be established for the facility.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. The president of the facility stated to
APHIS inspectors that there was no formalized scheduling of workers at the facility. A lack of properly trained
employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers
must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be added. Workers need to be trained in the basic
needs of the animals at the facility. Topics should include at a minimum: the need for adequate bedding during
times of extreme weather, the importance of cleaning and good housekeeping procedures, proper diet for different
species of animals and observation of animals for abnormal conditions and behaviors. This training should be done
in conjunction with the attending veterinarian or his designee. A list of topics covered and attendees must be
documented for review by APHIS. A facility schedule needs to be developed that allows for adequate employee
coverage in order to address all animal husbandry needs. Also the facility president is the only one authorized to
work with the dangerous animals at the facility. All animal work must be done with the dangerous animals under his
direct supervision. This limits the amount of time that is available to service the dangerous animal enclosures as
the facility president is often offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the dangerous animal enclosures. The facility
president needs to find a way to be onsite more or hire trained staff to help run the facility.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the facility president.
