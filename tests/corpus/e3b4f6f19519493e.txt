Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility has not updated the records since the last inspection. The current Record of Animals on Hand (exhibit
animals) lists some (but not all) of the species being exhibited and no acquisition information (name/address/date
acquired) is listed. A receipt was found for the acquisition of the cavy, the adult prairie dogs and one of the marmosets.
The records do not contain the required information for the second marmoset, the pigs, the African Crested porcupine, the
two rabbits, or the two prairie dogs born since the last inspection. In addition, the records did not account for the
disposition information for the 16 rabbits and 7 prairie dogs on exhibit in 2019 but no longer at the facility.
Complete and accurate acquisition and disposition records must be kept to allow for accurate identification of the animals
and to allow for medical and legal tracing. The facility shall make, keep and maintain records that fully and correctly
include all the required acquisition and disposition information. This information must include the name and address of the
person from whom the animals were acquired, the USDA license number of the person if licensed or the vehicle license
number and state and driver's license number and state if not licensed, the name and address of the person to whom and
animal was sold/given, the date of acquisition or disposition, the species of animal and the number of animals involved.
3.26(a)

Facilities, indoor.


The ambient indoor temperature next to the guinea pig and hamster enclosures was 86 degrees F at approximately 1:30
pm ET and 91.3 degrees F at 4pm ET. Guinea pigs and hamsters are susceptible to high temperatures/hyperthermia. To
provide for the health and comfort of the guinea pigs and hamsters, the ambient temperature shall not be allowed to
exceed 85 degrees F. Correct by 7/29/21.
3.52(a)

Facilities, outdoor.
Two rabbits are housed outdoors. Shade was provided but the ambient temperatures at approximately 1:00pm was 90.6
degrees. At 4pm ET it was 93.0 degrees F. No means of artificial cooling were provided. Rabbits are very sensitive to high
temperatures/hyperthermia. For the health and comfort of the rabbits, the facility shall provide artificial cooling such as by
a sprinkler system or other means when temperatures exceed 90 degrees F. Correct by 7/29/21.
3.75(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
The walls of the marmoset enclosure are constructed of a rough surfaced artificial material made to resemble tree bark
with many ridges and valleys. This surface is very difficult if not impossible to keep adequately cleaned and sanitized as
required by the regulations and cannot be easily removed and replaced when soiled. Cleaning difficulties have led to pest
control issues. The surfaces of housing facilities including the walls must be constructed in a manner and made of
materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed and replaced when worn or soiled. Correct by
9/27/21.
3.75(e)

Housing facilities, general.
The food supplies for the marmosets in the refrigerators are currently not being stored in a manner that prevents
contamination and deterioration. The shelves and walls of the refrigerators are dirty and coated with brown grime. Some


of the produce is resting on these shelves without being in any container. Some of the produce is old and needs to be
discarded. Expired foods such as the yogurt need to be discarded so they are not accidentally fed to the regulated
species. All food must be stored in a manner that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. Correct
by 8/1/21.
3.76(a)

Indoor housing facilities.
The temperature adjacent to the marmoset enclosure was 86 degrees F (kestrel) and inside the enclosure 87 degrees F
(temperature gun through solid window) at approximately 12:40 pm. At 4 pm the temperature at risen to 89.9 degrees F
(kestrel). The current weather forecast does not have the temperature declining significantly for at least four more hours.
Marmosets are susceptible to high temperatures/hyperthermia. Sufficient cooling is required to protect the marmosets
from temperature extremes and to provide for their health and well-being. The temperature shall not rise above 85
degrees F for more than 4 hours when the marmosets are present. Correct by 8/1/21.
3.84(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
A roach and multiple flies were noted in the marmoset enclosure. One of the marmosets was noted scratching when flies
got close. Insect pests can lead to discomfort of the marmosets and can potentially lead to spread of disease. The facility
must establish and maintain an effective program for control of insect pests. Correct by 8/27/21.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
No changes to the perimeter or enclosure fencing have occurred since the last inspection. The facility representative
stated she has not yet had time to apply for a variance. The facility exhibits the following species outdoors: prairie dogs,
cavy and an African Crested porcupine. The outdoor housing facilities for the prairie dogs and African Crested porcupine


are enclosed by fencing acting as a perimeter fence but it is not six feet high (only 2 feet high on one side and about 4-5
feet high on the rest of the sides). The cavy are not fully enclosed within a complete perimeter fence as required (two
sides of the enclosure also act as the perimeter fence).
A perimeter fence protects the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the animals in the facility and also functions as a secondary containment system for the
animals. The facility shall ensure that the outdoor housing facilities are enclosed by a perimeter fence at least six feet high
and more than three feet in distance from the primary enclosures or apply for written approval for fencing that does not
meet those requirements.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
*The indoor portion of the African Crested Porcupine enclosure needs to be cleaned. There is an accumulation of old corn
cobs, food wastes and enrichment wastes present. An odor is present.
*The pigs' water feature/concrete pond needs to be cleaned. The water is a bright green color due to contamination by
algae along with dirt/mud. Some types of algae may be toxic to animals.
The premises/grounds need to be kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury, diseases hazards, odors and pest
issues. Correct by 8/1/21.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
