Primary enclosures.
Two approximately 8 week old puppies had an area of flooring that had 1x1 inch openings in the mesh (the rest of the
floor was smaller openings). One puppy's foot would occasionally go slightly through the 1x1 inch openings. Floors that
allow feet to pass through could cause injury to the dogs. Mesh/slat floors have to be constructed in a manner that do not
allow dogs' feet to pass through.

Note: The licensee corrected this condition prior to the exit interview. Maintain correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
