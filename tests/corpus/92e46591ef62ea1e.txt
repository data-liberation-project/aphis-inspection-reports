3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
During the previous inspection on March 16, 2016, the male elk was observed to have green netting from a bale of
hay attached to his antlers and covering the front of his face. The netting was to be removed from the animal by
noon on March 19. At the current inspection on March 22, 2016, the male elk still has the netting attached to his
antlers and drapped across his face. The facility representative said that she has contacted the attending
veterinarian and he plans come to the facility and evaluate the elk at a future time. The netting attached to the face
of the elk could cause damage to the eyes, interfere with his field of vision, and affect his ability to eat and drink.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and facilitate husbandry
practices. Trash and unused materials shall be placed in appropriate areas and cleared from the animal enclosures
to protect the health of the animals. The facility must remove the hay netting from the animal for his safety and
well-being and ensure that all animal enclosures remain free of trash and unused materials at all times.
This is a focused inspection limited to only the condition of the male elk cited under 3.131(c) on inspection report
dated March 16, 2016.
Exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
