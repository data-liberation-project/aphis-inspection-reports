ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 PM on

Spoke with the licensee via cell phone. The licensee was at a previously scheduled appointment. I did receive
better days and hours of availability from the licensee.
