ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00-2:30pm
on 19-DEC-18.
I tried to make contact at the facility. I called the number on file and waited in the driveway for 30 minutes prior to
departing the facility.
