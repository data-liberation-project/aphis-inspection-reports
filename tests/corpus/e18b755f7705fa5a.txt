ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** One dog identified as "Stormy" # 014 had matted fur on the outside of the ears that needs to be addressed.
Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin causing irritation which is potentially painful. These ears need to be
groomed and then groomed on a routine basis to prevent this from occurring.
*** Another dog identified as "Pebbles" # 012 had some matted fur underneath below the stomach. Again, matted
fur pulls and separates from the skin causing irritation which is potentially painful. This dog needs to have the
matted fur removed and then groomed on a routine basis to prevent this from occurring.
