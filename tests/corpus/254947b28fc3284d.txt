2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A grey and white male Shih Tzu (couldn't read the tag number) was limping on his right front leg during inspection.
Upon closer examination, the right front paw was noticeably swollen. It was also sensitive to touch as the dog
expressed discomfort during examination. No obvious wounds or cuts were noted during examination. The
licensee did not observe the dog's condition prior to inspection. A swollen paw that is sensitive to the touch
indicates the dog is in pain and that the paw may be infected. The Attending Veterinarian must be contacted and
the dog must be treated per his/her instructions. Correct by 7/19/16.
Note: The licensee contacted the Attending Veterinarian during the inspection and left a message to schedule an
appointment for first thing in the morning.
Indirect:
Multiple medications were found to be expired during inspection. In addition, one of the expired medications had a
label on it, but the name of the medication was unreadable. The following is a list of the medications found to have
expired:
Equidone Gel---Ex. August 2014
Azithromycin---Ex. February 2016
Container containing pills (could not read the name of the medication on the label)---Ex. 3/6/16
Expired medications doesn't ensure that the products are safe to use. Unreadable labels doesn't ensure that the
correct medication is being given to the animal(s). All expired medications products must be discarded once they
expire. The licensee must ensure that the labels for the medications are easily readable and must either discard the
medication or relabel the medication once the original label becomes unreadable. Correct immediately.2.51(b)(3)
FORM OF OFFICIAL TAG.
The animal number for a grey and white male Shih Tzu was unreadable. Not being able to read the animal number
on the tag doesn't allow for APHIS officials or the licensee to easily identify the animal when necessary. The tag
must be replaced or repaired so the animal number is easily readable. Correct by 8/1/16.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
End of report.
