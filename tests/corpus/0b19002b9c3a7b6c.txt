3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
In an outdoor pen housing three steers, there is thick mud and standing water covering approximately half of the space as
well as the area surrounding the hay feeder and the floor of the shelter. These animals do not have access to food or
shelter without having to stand or walk in several inches of mud. The feet of the animals were noted sinking into the
muddy ground and mud was noted on all three animals’ legs and abdomens.
In an outdoor pen housing ten calves, there is thick mud surrounding the hay feeder and a combination of thick mud and
standing water along the front of the grain trough that is used every morning. These animals do not have access to food
without having to stand in thick mud or water.
Mud and standing water can lead to discomfort due to soiling of the animals, especially in cold weather, and can
contribute to skin and foot issues. Additionally, animals may be less likely to use spaces that are not dry.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Primary enclosures for animals must have a
method to eliminate excess water to provide dry access to food, water, and shelter for the animals contained.
To be corrected by January 31, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
