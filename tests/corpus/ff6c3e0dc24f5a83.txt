3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Within the indoor housing facility, there are 12 enclosures on the left side containing 19 dogs that have an excessive
accumulation of dirt, fur and excreta on the surfaces. The rubber floor mats being used have a layer of excreta and
fur on the top surface. There is an excessive accumulation of fur, grime and fecal material adhered to the lower half
of the chain-link fencing material. These enclosures on the left side have not been properly cleaned and sanitized
within the last two weeks.
The enclosures containing two dogs located on the right side of the building have been cleaned and sanitized. The
licensee stated she was waiting for paint to dry before moving more dogs from the left side to the right side so
cleaning and sanitization could be done without wetting the dogs.
Cleaning and sanitization of surfaces that are in contact with the dogs is necessary to prevent the accumulation of
dirt, debris, excreta and other disease hazards. Hard surfaces the dogs come in contact with must be spot-cleaned
daily. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces within the housing facility are cleaned and sanitized once every
two weeks or more often if needed for the health and well-being of the dogs.
This is a focused inspection to address the Direct non-compliant item listed under 3.1 (c) (3) on the January 19,
2016 inspection report.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
