3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fencing for the facility is approximately 6 ft high, with a charged electric wire on the top and bottom.
As Cheetahs fall into the category of big cats, the requirement is for the perimeter fence to be at least 8 ft high to act
as a secondary containment system, unless a variance is obtained. Variance may be requested from the regional
office based on site location, security measures and other factors.
