2.131(d)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On September 25, 2019, the licensee transported a 5 day old cougar cub to a public event. The neonatal cub was
transported for approximately 2 hours and at the public event for approximately 1 hour, during this time, it was
contained in a cardboard box that was insulated on the bottom with layers of towels, a heating pad, and plastic
lining to keep the box warm and dry. The neonatal cub was removed from the box for feeding during the public
event. Before returning to the facility, the licensee stopped by a car dealership event at which time the event host
viewed the cub while in vehicle.

On both September 28th and September 29th, at the age of 8 and 9 days old, the licensee conducted a 10 minute
talk for the public at the facility during the scheduled feeding time of the neonatal cub. For these feedings, the cub
was removed from the nursery and taken outside for public viewing.
On October 1, 2019, the licensee allowed radio station personnel access to facility’s on-site nursey to promote the
new cougar cub. At one point during the interview, the licensee placed the young animal next to the interviewer’s
face.
Due to the young age of the cougar cub, she has a developing immune system and unable to effectively regulate
her body temperature, these exposures to the public environment and transportation potentially exposed the
neonatal cub to diseases and changes in temperature that could affect its health and well-being.
Neonatal non-domestic cats should only be exhibited for periods of time and under conditions consistent with their
good health and well-being.
The inspection was conducted by Karla Wills, Jessica Gowins and facility representatives on October 8, 2019. The
exit interview was conduct with facility representative on October 17, 2019.
