ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Based upon the videos reviewed, the following were observed: For the treatment of rectal prolapse, one or two
facility personnel hold the primate(s) upside down, and shake the primate while inserting a finger in the anus and
pushing back the rectal mucosa. This appears to be performed with or without anesthesia, without lubrication or
suturing of any kind. The standard of care for this procedure is to always provide anesthesia under veterinarian
direction, clean the affected tissue, lubrication of the finger and anal area to reduce further trauma, pain, or injury,
and suturing at the veterinarian(cid:25)s discretion.
Facility personnel are extracting teeth by holding a primate, prying open its(cid:25) mouth and pulling the tooth by hand or
an instrument. This is not an appropriate method to extract teeth without following established veterinary medical
procedures. Extracting teeth by the observed method may cause unnecessary pain and distress to the primate, and
does not minimize potential infections.
Veterinary procedures (suturing, debriding, amputations, CSF collections) are being performed outdoors in the quad
areas. These types of procedures shall be done in clean, dedicated areas to reduce the risk of infections,
overheating, excessive cooling during the procedure, as well as during the recovery phase.
Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include (but are not limited to):
the availability of appropriate facilities & methods to treat diseases and injuries, as well as adequate guidance to
personnel involved in the care and use of animals in handling, treating, anesthesia, analgesia or tranquilization.
Correct immediately.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility is not always documenting daily observations for all outdoor enclosures. There were no records found
for observations on the following enclosures on the following days: Q22 on 3/28/15; Q25D on 2/26/15; Q11 on3/15/15, 3/16/15, 4/1/15, 4/15/15, and 4/16/15. These enclosures/quads had animal(s) with health and medical
conditions during these specified days without documentation of daily observation.
According to the operations manager, the husbandry technicians are trained and required to fill out an observation
form for all enclosures/quads every day. The technicians are to note all animals are normal or any abnormal
observations. The observation forms are to be put in the mailbox between 9 and 10 a.m. for the veterinary staff to
collect and respond to any abnormal observations.
Failure to make and record daily observations can lead to animals with health and medical conditions being
overlooked. Additionally, these conditions may not be communicated to the veterinary staff accurately and in a
timely manner. The facility must ensure there are daily observations of all animals and there is a mechanism of
direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by 6/2/15.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Based upon videos that were reviewed, it appears that the procedure for capturing the primates within the
enclosures is not performed as carefully or expeditiously as possible.
After chasing them around the enclosure, facility personnel grab primates by their tail, then pull on their tails to
remove the primates from the chain link they are hanging onto. This maneuver can result in trauma to the tails of
the primates (and may be contributing factors to the several tail degloving & rectal prolapse incidents that have
occurred).
After they are grabbed, and captured, the primates are then put into a pole net, sometimes with another captured
monkey. On occasion, it was observed on the video, that these pole nets were lowered by the personnel which
resulted in the captured primates hitting and dragging along the concrete ground. If two primates are within the
same net, this can also contribute the primates injuring each other during this stressful time.
Additionally, it also appears that some of the primates are being chased around the enclosures for an extended
period of time before they are grabbed or captured by a pole net. This can potentially overheat the primates during
the hot weather/high humidity this facility frequently experiences.
These capture procedures are not being performed as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does
not cause trauma, overheating, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Correct immediately.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In enclosure 9A, the chain link partition across the middle of the enclosure, had sharp points projecting downward at
the bottom.
These sharp points can injure animals that may extend a body part under the partition. The housing facilities must
be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Facility maintenance was notified immediately to repair the panel, and repairs were started before the inspection
was completed.
On the morning of January 31, 2014, three (3) animals in the same enclosure were found dead; all next to each
other. An internal PPI investigation and necropsies were conducted, which identified electrocution as the cause of
death of all 3 nonhuman primates (NHP). The investigation revealed that an electrical cord powering a heat lamp at
the quadrant, and within close proximity to animal enclosures, was found with multiple bite marks and exposed
copper wires. Housing facilities for NHP must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of NHP housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from
injury or death.
PPI responded immediately by discontinuing all use of all electrical cords going in proximity of animal enclosures;
butane-driven burners are used now. On February 6, 2014 PPI provided training to all personnel regarding aspects
of the incident and prevention of similar occurrences.
Corrected prior to inspection.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
According to facility records, as indicated by the veterinarian or husbandry technicians, several animals were noted
as either having necrotic tails or being cold during the past winter.
On 12/04/14, animal 3908501726, was noted by the veterinarian as having a (cid:28)necrotic tail (frost bitten), dehyd(cid:29). This
animal received treatment and tail amputation on 12/4/14. Prior to November 11/29/14, this animal was housed in
an outdoor enclosure. Historical weather data, taken from www.wunderground.com, shows the following minimum
local temperatures (T, degrees Fahrenheit) and wind chills (WC, degrees Fahrenheit): 11/29/14 T: 42 WC: 35;11/28/14 T: 39 WC: 31; 11/27/14 T: 39 WC: 32; 11/26/14 T: 46 WC: 40.

According to facility personnel, as stated to the Animal Care Veterinary Medical Officers, the facility does not
provide supplemental heat to all outdoor enclosures. It is up to the discretion of facility personnel to determine which
enclosure(s) receive supplemental heat. Additionally, the facility does not have the resources to provide supplement
heat to all outdoor enclosures.
Failure to provide supplemental heat can lead to health and medical conditions including cold stress, frostbite,
hypothermia and death. The facility must safely provide heat to all outdoor enclosures when the ambient
temperatures fall below 45 degrees Fahrenheit and/or when the animals are exhibiting &/may show signs of cold
stress. To be corrected by 7/31/15.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
On October 7, 2014, a bear which had been seen a number of times around the office area, was able to climb over
the perimeter fence and gain access the animal facility. Facility personnel were able to chase the bear out of the
animal area. The facility stated they had been in contact with the State Fish and Game Department regarding the
bear. On October 8, 2014, the bear again gained access to the animal facility and two non-human primates were
subsequently killed.
The perimeter fence must be constructed to keep unauthorized humans and unwanted species out.
Immediately following the second breach, the facility added electric wire to the perimeter fence, and the bear has
not been seen since. They have also held training for the employees for dealing with encounters with wildlife on the
property.
This noncompliance was corrected prior to the time of inspection.
3.81(a)(3)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
From a representative sample of records that were reviewed, primates appear to be repeatedly traumatized (bites,
tail/arm injuries) by their cage mate(s).
The records for primate # A2E023 indicate that this primate had a tail degloving in November 2014 while in social
group/enclosure PT/Q2D. She was returned to the same enclosure after treatment. In February 2015, this primate
received a laceration of her left hand which ultimately resulted in amputation of digits. On May 11, 2015, this
primate received another tail injury which also resulted in an amputation of the tail. All of these injuries occurred
while this primate was in the same enclosure/group.
On August 28, 2014, primate #3462110508 (no longer at the facility) received an injury to her left arm. On January
12 2015, this primate had a tail deglove injury which resulted in the amputation of 2/3 of the tail. These injuries
occurred while in social group/enclosure PT/Q25D.
Many of the primates that were observed on the inspection had varying degrees of alopecia (hair loss) which
frequently is a result of stress over grooming, or aggressive activity by others within the enclosure. Primates may not be housed with other primates unless they are compatible and are not known to be hazardous to
the health and well-being of each other. Develop a formalized plan for animals that appear not to be compatible
with each other which would include (but not limited to) at what point (frequency/severity) does an individual primate
necessitate removal from its social group to protect its(cid:25) health and well-being.
Correct by June 15, 2015.
3.84(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
During the cleaning of enclosures, the non-human primates (NHP(cid:25)s), are becoming wet. The Animal Care
Veterinary Medical Officers observed the husbandry technicians move the NHP(cid:25)s from the enclosure into the tunnel
chute (as per facility standard operating procedure). The tunnel chute is outside and up against the concrete wall
(which is approximately 3ft tall) of the primary enclosure. As the technician sprays the top of the concrete wall and
the food receptacles on the enclosure fencing, the water overspray is wetting the NHP(cid:25)s in the chute below.
Wetting of animals during the cleaning process can lead to stress and health problems. The facility must ensure,
during the cleaning process, that animals will not be harmed, wetted, or distressed in the process.
To be corrected by 5/29/15.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted by 4 Animal Care Veterinary Medical Officers, 1 Supervisory Animal
Care Specialist and 1 Investigative and Enforcement Services Investigator with facility representative.
