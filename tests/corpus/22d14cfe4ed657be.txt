Contingency planning.
Facility has not yet developed and documented a contingency plan. A contingency plan provides for the humane handling,
treatment, transportation, housing and care of the non-human primates in the event of an emergency or disaster which
could reasonably be anticipated. The plan should identify the situations that would trigger the plan, outline tasks to be
carried out in response to the emergency, identify a chain of command/responsible person and address how response
and recovery will be handled. The facility shall develop and document a contingency plan. Correct by Oct. 6, 2022.

Sheltered housing facilities.
The sheltered part of the sheltered housing for the owl monkeys is only partially lighted. The light fixture for the front half
of the building has fallen down and has not been replaced leaving one enclosure housing two owl monkeys in the dark.
There is not enough light to permit routine inspection of the owl monkey enclosure closest to the door. The sheltered part
of the housing facility for the owl monkeys must be lighted well enough to provide sufficient light to aid in good
housekeeping practices, cleaning, inspection of animals and for the well-being of the animals. Correct by 10/6/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
