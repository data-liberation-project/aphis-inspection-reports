2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A cream colored female Maltese named "Molly" (microchip # 044-011-817) had hair loss on its tail. The licensee
informed me that the Attending Veterinarian had not been consulted with in regards to the tail. In addition the dog
had a buildup of white and grey gunk that had built up on the right upper side of the back part of its mouth. It
appeared that at least one of the teeth on the upper jaw was loose, but it was difficult to determine because of the
gunk that had built up. The Attending Veterinarian had not been consulted with on this either.
Hair loss can indicate there is an underlying illness or parasitic infection which can be irritating and possibly
contagious to other dogs. Dental problems can be painful and can lead to systemic infection which could be
detrimental to the dog's health.
The Attending Veterinarian must be consulted with in regards to the dog. The dog must be treated per his/her
instructions. Correct by 10/7/16.
Multiple medications were found to be expired during inspection. Oral Cal Plus expired 03/2016. Ivomec expired
06/2014. Canine Distemper vaccines expired 11/23/15. Expired medications and vaccines doesn't ensure that the
product given to the animal is safe and of a high quality. The expired products could be ineffective or toxic to the
animal(s). Expired vaccines and medications must not be used on regulated animals and need to be disposed of.
Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
