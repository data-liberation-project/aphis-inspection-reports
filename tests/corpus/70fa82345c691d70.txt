Housing facilities, general.
*The indoor/sheltered portion of the enclosure housing two squirrel monkeys is within a shed type building. The indoor
enclosure takes up about a third of the space of the building. The rest of the building is used as storage for a large tightly
packed accumulation of a wide variety of materials/tools/items not used on a daily basis to care for the monkeys.
*Accumulations of stored items and storage areas not kept neat and free of clutter make it difficult to keep the non-human
primate housing areas clean and sanitized, odor free and pest free.
*Housing facilities for non-human primates must be kept neat and free of clutter including stored materials, equipment,
and furniture except for those items necessary for proper daily husbandry practices. Correct by 11/20/21.
3.75(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
*Several surfaces of the non-human primate housing facilities require maintenance. They include:
Owl monkey enclosure: a section of linoleum covering the indoor wood wall (used to render the surface
cleanable/sanitizable) adjacent to the opening between the indoor and outdoor portions of the enclosure has come loose
and is hanging as a large strip. The wood is exposed. The monkeys have access to the wood, the linoleum strip itself and
the dried glue material on the back of the linoleum strip.


Lemur enclosure: sections of the linoleum covering the floor and lower wall are bunched creating pockets that were
retaining liquid that appeared to be water at the time of inspection.
Capuchin sheltered/indoor housing: the surface of the wood door and adjacent frame/wall appears swollen and soft as if it
has suffered water or some other damage within its structure.
Capuchin enclosure: a section of wire mesh with small openings was added to the outdoor portion of the enclosure. It has
sharp points where it was cut; the capuchins can come in contact with the points.
*Surfaces in non-human primate housing facilities require regular maintenance to keep them in good repair, to allow them
to be readily cleaned and sanitized and to protect the animals from injury.
*All surfaces of non-human primate housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled.

Sheltered housing facilities.
*There is no lighting source in the sheltered/indoor portion of the squirrel monkey housing. There are no windows or other
natural light sources except for the very small amount of light that enters through the opening the monkeys use to access
the sheltered portion.
The sheltered/indoor portion of the owl monkey and lemur housing has insufficient lighting. There is one light bulb in the
hallway near the entrance of the sheltered/indoor housing but the light does not reach to the other end of the
indoor/sheltered housing. The enclosure furthest from the light (housing the lemurs) is in the dark even when the light is
on and thus cannot be readily observed. The only natural light was from the small openings used by the monkeys to move
from the sheltered/indoor to the outdoor portions of the housing and is not sufficient to see within the indoor/sheltered
housing area. In addition, the single light bulb was turned off as the inspector entered. The facility representative reports


that the light is only used when the animals are inspected or cared for. Thus the sheltered/ indoor housing area is almost
always dark and is not providing the animals a regular diurnal lighting cycle of natural or artificial light.
*Adequate lighting of non-human primate housing is necessary to permit routine inspection of the facilities, cleaning of the
facilities, adequate daily observation of the non-human primates for any abnormalities of health or behavior, and animal
well-being.
*The sheltered/indoor areas of the non-human primate housing facilities must be provided a regular diurnal lighting cycle
of either natural or artificial light. The lighting must be uniformly diffused throughout the animal facilities and provide
sufficient illumination for housekeeping/cleaning, inspection of the animals and animal well-being.
