2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Loose watery stools are in several runs during this inspection, including runs 25, 35, 36, and 5. All of the dogs are
in good condition and no other signs are seen. The loose stools need to be evaluated and monitored to determine
what treatment is needed if the condition continues.
Dog 723 has a chronic skin condition, first noted by the caretaker in January. The skin of the forelegs is furless,
slightly scabby, and is thickened and laying in folds. This condition is around her ears and there is some scratched
raw areas below the left ear. This skin condition needs to be diagnosed and treatment provided.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Various materials are used for the benches in the dogs enclosures. In several runs (5,6,7,12,21,37) in the larger
shelter building and 2, 10 in the smaller shelter building) there are holes in the canvas like material serving as a
bench. These need to be repaired or replaced to prevent potential injury to the dogs.
The concrete has eroded leaving holes in the top of the half wall between some runs (22-23, 24-25, 26-27, 29 to
37). These holes need to be patched so that water does not stand in them, leading to potential disease hazards.
To be corrected by 6-20-14.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
