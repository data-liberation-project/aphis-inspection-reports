ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A wolf, Anubis, was observed having difficulty walking and standing which may be due to long nails. The visible
skin on his paws appears red and irritated. The licensee has stated that the wolf is difficult to handle without
sedation and she has asked for assistance from her attending veterinarian, however, at this time there is no recent
written documentation available to show the condition is being addressed by the veterinarian. In April 2014 the
licensee did sedate Anubis and cut back the nails. Excessive nail growth can be uncomfortable and cause injury to
the animals. Anubis' condition must be addressed by the attending veterinarian to alleviate his discomfort and
appropriate treatment provided. If the condition is related to long nails a program for monitoring and trimming of the
nails must be implemented to ensure the health and well-being of the wolf.

FEEDING.
The floor and walls in the commissary are dirty. Along the bottom of the walls, in the corners, behind the
refrigerators, and under the shelves, there are accumulations of dirt and debris. There are areas under and around
the refrigerators, the tables and shelving with dried up dark brown dirty residue, The accumulations of dirt, debris
and dried residue may harbor bacteria and attract unwanted insects and vermin, which could contaminate the food
stored and prepared here.
There are soaps, cleaning supplies and other items sitting on shelves over the food preparation tables. These items
may spill or drop into food being prepared below contaminating it.
Eating contaminated food would be hazardous to the health of the animals. The cleaning supplies and other items
should be stored safely and away from food preparation areas. The commissary where food is stored and prepared
must be cleaned more thoroughly to prevent the contamination of food and protect the well-being of the animals.
