FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A section of the enclosure roof/top fencing was in disrepair in the lion enclosure (Sheba) during the time of
inspection. The top of the enclosure is partially covered with cyclone wire fencing. A section of the wire fencing,
located adjacent to the barn, was drooping down towards the enclosure. This area of fencing doesn't ensure that
the lion is secured in the enclosure.
Repair or replace the affected area of roof/top fencing to ensure that the lion is secured in its enclosure.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Two sections of the perimeter fence are not eight feet tall. A section (approximately sixty feet) of perimeter fence,
along the east side of the facility, is only six and one half feet tall. This section of perimeter fence is behind the
recently constructed raccoon and fox enclosures. An additional small section of the perimeter fence is between six
and seven feet tall. This section of fence, along the north side of the facility, is located adjacent to a tiger enclosure
(Lena) and the food storage building. Perimeter fencing must be of sufficient height to inhibit wild animals and
unauthorized persons from accessing the facility.
Repair, replace, or modify the affected areas of the perimeter fence.
