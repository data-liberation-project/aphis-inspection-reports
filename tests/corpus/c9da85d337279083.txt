2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male poodle named Dillon was observed with a severe buildup of dental tartar and calculi along the teeth on both sides
of the upper jaw. In addition, the gumline was receding in these areas. According to kennel records this dog had been
identified as being in need of a dental procedure in March 2022 as well as 10-4-22. There had been no attempts made to
clean the dogs teeth up until the time the USDA inspection was conducted. Dental abnormalities can cause the dog
discomfort and may negatively affect the animals health. Any abnormal health issues must be communicated to the
attending veterinarian in a timely manner when identified so that the animal can be provided appropriate veterinary care.

*********The licensee contacted the attending veterinarian during the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
