3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
During a walk-through of the animal housing areas, the following deficiencies were noted:
- Several of the cat enclosures had coated wire that had become detached in the upper corners from the framing of the
enclosure, creating gaps between the coated wire and the frame.
- In dog room G, the metal framing on the outside of enclosure 1 that helps secure the coated wire to the framing of the
enclosure had become detached at the bottom ~18in of the framing.
- Also in dog room G, enclosure 7 had an insecure latch that allowed the dog within the enclosure to open the door (the
dog remained within the enclosure).
- In dog room B, the divider between enclosures 15 and 16 was loose, leaving a gap at the bottom of the divider.
- In dog room D3, enclosure 4 had an insecure latch that allowed the two dogs within the enclosure to open the door (both
dogs remained in the enclosure).

Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be maintained in good repair so as to protect the animals from injury or escape.
Gaps and openings in enclosures can harm the animals if they get caught up in one of these openings or they are allowed
to escape an enclosure.



Correct by properly maintaining all animal enclosures in good repair.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
