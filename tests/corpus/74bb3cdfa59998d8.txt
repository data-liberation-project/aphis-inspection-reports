ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One brown and white goat in the enclosure with the goat walk is thin. The goat's ribs, spine and hip bones are
clearly visible and protruding. There is fresh loose dark brown black fecal material adhered to the underside of the
goat's tail and around the anal area. There is some dried light grey material on the haircoat of the goat's backs of
the rear legs. The goat appeared active and was grazing during the inspection. The attending veterinarian has not
yet been out to see the exhibit animals this year and no records of any deworming or diarrhea treatment were noted
in the animal record book. Loose stool can be a sign of internal parasite infection or disease. The brown and white
goat needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to ensure a diagnosis is made and a treatment plan instituted.
Documentation of the diagnosis and treatment shall be maintained. Correct by 9/29/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
