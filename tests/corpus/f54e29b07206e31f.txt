WATERING.
An enclosure housing 7 guinea pigs has a dirty water bottle as the only source of drinking water. The water in the
bottle is cloudy and grayish-brown. There is a thick sediment layer at the bottom of the bottle.Dirty water is
unhealthy to animals and could be contaminated with toxins and / or infectious agents that could sicken the animals.
Potable water shall be provided daily. Open containers used for dispensing water to guinea pigs shall be so placed
in or attached to the primary enclosure as to minimize contamination from excreta. All watering receptacles shall be
sanitized when dirty.

3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
An enclosure housing 7 guinea pigs has a heavy accumulation of excreta. Feces forms a dense layer on top of the
litter that the animals cannot avoid walking or sitting on. This heavy accumulation of fecal matter creates an
unhealthy environment for the animals that could lead to illness and discomfort.
A glass aquarium housing 14 hamsters has a layer of brown, oily grime on the inside of the walls at a level where
the animals are in direct contact with it. The buildup is thick enough that it is difficult to see through. This grime
cannot be disinfected or sanitized and therefore could be a source of germs that could contaminate the animals and
make them ill.
Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris:
Provided, however, That such enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Enclosures for guinea pigs
and hamsters shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water (180 [deg]F.) and soap or detergent as in a
mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective
disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam.
