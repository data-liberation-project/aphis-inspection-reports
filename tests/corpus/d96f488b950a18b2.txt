Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There is standing water in the outdoor portion of one sheltered enclosure housing three Chihuahuas. The concrete does
not allow the water used for washing/cleaning and from rain to drain resulting in standing water. Additionally, fecal waste
has mixed with this water to create an accumulation of contaminated water. Accumulated water and waste can play a role
in disease transmission, attract pests, and cause the animals to become wet or soiled. The licensee must remove excreta
and food waste from primary enclosures daily and ensure that standing water be removed from the primary enclosure. To
be corrected by 25 March 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
