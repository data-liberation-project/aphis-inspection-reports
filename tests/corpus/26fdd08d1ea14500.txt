Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) states that serval cats should be treated with monthly topical flea
prevention medication. The licensee stated that she has not administered the flea medication to the 2 adult serval cats for
at least 2 months due to concerns about the cats reproductive status (pregnancy). The Attending Veterinarian was
contacted and stated that the servals should be maintained on flea preventative medication as written in the PVC.
Following the Attending Veterinarian’s instructions is critically important for ensuring animal health and wellbeing. Failure
to follow the Attending Veterinarian’s instructions may result in the occurrence of parasite infections or other health
problems. Correct by 5/1/22 by following the instructions provided by the Attending Veterinarian and contacting the
Attending Veterinarian regarding any concerns or questions about the written PVC.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult male Savannah cat (“Savannah #6”, microchip #981020035855517) is limping on his left front leg, and the left
side of his face is slightly swollen. When the cat is standing, he often lifts the left front foot off the ground, and when
walking he favors the leg slightly. The left lower side of his face is swollen compared to the right side of his face. There is
a small hairless area with a red scab on the left side of his neck, under his chin. The licensee had not observed these


issues prior to the inspection. The cat is otherwise bright, active, and in normal body condition.
An adult female Savannah cat (“Savannah #1”, microchip #991001003899513) has watery eyes, clear eye discharge, and
is sneezing and mildly congested. The cat is otherwise bright, active, and in normal body condition. The licensee stated
that she had observed these issues but had not contacted the Attending Veterinarian, but had considered starting the cat
on Amoxi-Drops. The written Program of Veterinary Care does not include instructions for the care of eye or respiratory
infections in cats.
On or around 4/2/22, an approximately 2-day-old female serval kitten was found by the licensee to be doing poorly and
she removed it from its mother to try to provide care for it. The licensee contacted a veterinary technician who is not
associated with the Attending Veterinarian (AV) and attempted to provide care for the kitten, but it died. The licensee
stated that she did not contact the AV because it was after normal business hours, and that she did not contact an
emergency veterinary clinic because she didn’t think they would be willing or able to work on a serval. The AV was not
contacted after the death and no necropsy was performed.
The prompt identification of animal health issues and timely communication with the AV is essential for ensuring the
health and welfare of animals. Animals with unidentified or untreated health issues may suffer from stress, pain, or
worsening of their conditions which may in some cases lead to death.
Correct by 4/26/22 by conducting daily observation of all regulated animals to assess their health and well-being, and by
having direct and frequent communication with the AV regarding all problems of animal health, behavior, and wellbeing.

Handling of animals.
On 3/29/22 an approximately 3-year-old female child was scratched by a serval cat on exhibit in the store. The enclosure
housing 2 adult serval cats is located in the retail area of the store. The enclosure is made of welded wire panels that
have square openings that are approximately 2 inches by 2 inches in size. According to the licensee, at the time of the


incident, there was a public barrier around the serval enclosure that consisted of vertical 3-foot-tall posts (stanchions) and
a retractable flexible strap stretched between the tops the posts. The horizontal strap was 3-feet from the ground and
there was nothing preventing a child or animal from passing under the strap. The distance between the animal enclosure
and the public barrier was 3 feet in the area where the child was injured, which was at the far end of the serval enclosure
next to the chinchillas. A sign was also present instructing people not to reach or stick anything past the barrier.
According to the licensee, she went to the back of the store to retrieve an animal and then she heard screaming. She
immediately returned to the retail area and found the child being comforted by her mother, who stated that the child had
been scared by the cat. A few minutes later, the licensee saw that there was some blood on the child, and the mother
stated that the serval cat had scratched the child. The child was taken to the emergency room.
At the time of the inspection, a few segments of caution tape had been added to the public barrier around the serval
enclosure to block children from walking under the barrier. However, the caution tape is flexible and could be pushed
aside or torn by a child.
Serval cats have sharp claws and teeth which can injure people or animals who come too close to their enclosure.
People or animals who are scratched or bitten by serval cats may suffer from pain, fear, injury, or infection. Serval cats
who scratch or bite people may themselves be injured in the process or may be subject to administrative consequences
such as local or state requirements for quarantine or euthanasia.
Correct by 4/26/22 by ensuring that during public exhibition, the serval cats are handled so that there is minimal risk of
harm to the animals and to the public, with sufficient distance and strong, effective barriers between the animals and the
general viewing public as to assure the safety of animals and the public (including small children).
3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.


5 adult cats (4 Savannah, 1 Bengal) are housed in an outdoor building with wooden and wire walls. There were numerous
(more than 20) pointed ends of nails sticking out of the walls at the level that could be touched by the cats. Sharp objects
in enclosures may cause injury to the animals within. Correct by 6/1/22 by ensuring that enclosures contain no sharp
edges or points that could injure the animals within.
3.6(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
5 adult cats (4 Savannah, 1 Bengal) are housed in an outdoor building with wooden and wire walls. The wood is not
painted or treated to make it impervious to moisture, and the wood was scratched and irregular in some places. Building
surfaces in contact with cats must be impervious to moisture to allow for cleaning and sanitization. Correct by 6/1/22 by
ensuring that building surfaces in contact with cats are impervious to moisture.
3.6(b)(4)

Primary enclosures.
The outdoor enclosure housing 4 adult cats (2 male, 2 female) contains two medium sized plastic pet taxis which serve as
the only elevated resting surfaces in the enclosure. These surfaces are not large enough for all 4 cats to rest comfortably
on at the same time. Resting on elevated surfaces is an important natural behavior for cats. Correct by 6/1/22 by
providing elevated resting surfaces in the enclosure that are big enough for all cats to rest on comfortably at the same
time.
3.53(c)(2)

Primary enclosures.
7 juvenile rabbits were contained in a cage that was 30 inches wide and 30 inches long, providing 900 square inches of
floor space (900 square inches / 144 = 6.25 square feet). Each juvenile rabbit requires 1.5 square feet of floor space, so
the 7 juvenile rabbits require 10.5 square feet (1.5 square feet x 7 = 10.5 square feet). Adequate floor space is important


for rabbit health and comfort. Rabbits who do not have adequate floor space may suffer from stress and competition for
food and space. Correct by 4/26/22 by providing the minimum amount of floor space required under the Animal Welfare
Act for rabbits. Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.55 Direct

Watering.
At the time of inspection, 7 juvenile rabbits were housed in an enclosure that contained one water bowl, which was empty.
The licensee filled the water bowl and all of the rabbits drank from the water bowl for 30-60 seconds continuously (once
they discovered the water), some rabbits crowding around the bowl and pushing one another out of the way. Rabbits that
do not have access to water may suffer from thirst, discomfort, or dehydration. Correct by 4/26/22 by providing adequate
water for all of the rabbits in the enclosure to prevent thirst. Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The enclosure housing the serval cats is located in the retail area of the store, and is made of welded wire panels that
have openings that are approximately 2 inches by 2 inches in size. The enclosure measures 78 inches wide, 170 inches
long, and 69 inches tall. There is a 2-inch vertical gap between two panels at the center of the front of the enclosure; one
zip tie holds these panels together. The gap stretches from the floor to the top of the enclosure. During the inspection, the
female serval cat put both of her front feet through the vertical gap. Serval cats are strong and may push against or climb
on the wall of their enclosures, which can cause zip ties to break. Correct by 5/1/22 by ensuring that the serval cat
enclosure is structurally sound and maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
3.128

Space requirements.


The enclosure housing two adult 2-year-old serval cats is located in the retail area of the store, and is made of welded
wire panels. The enclosure measures 78 inches wide, 170 inches long, and 69 inches tall. The enclosure contains 2
uncovered cat boxes, an Igloo-style dog house, a food bowl, and water bowl, and a wire crate which contains a large pet
bed. One small plastic ball was present in the enclosure for enrichment. There are no shelves, platforms, perches, or
elevated resting surfaces for the animals to rest on. According to the licensee, when the female serval cat was in late
pregnancy at the end of April 2022, the enclosure was divided in half with one adult serval on each side, and the female
had kittens in the Igloo-style dog house. The female serval was not provided with any additional privacy, enrichment, or
resting areas outside the dog house itself, and the store was open to the public during that time. Furthermore, the male
serval had only the wire crate, pet bed, and cat box in his half of the enclosure. The female failed to rear the kittens
successfully and despite intervention they died, after which the enclosure was opened up into one connected area again.
Natural behaviors for serval cats include running, climbing, jumping, and resting on elevated surfaces. Female serval cats
with nursing offspring naturally hide and may be extremely sensitive to noise, unknown people/animals, disruptions, and
odors. Serval cats who do not have opportunities to perform natural behaviors such as resting on an elevated platform or
hiding in a quiet environment during birth and nursing may suffer from stress, poor condition, debility, or abnormal
behavior patterns such as loosing interest in nursing offspring. Correct by 6/1/22 by housing the serval cats in an
enclosure that is constructed and maintained as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural
and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
