Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A black and tan female Yorkie named “Tanzie” (microchip number 985112003782513) was found to have extremely
heavy tartar build up over numerous teeth. The gums are starting to recede over the upper teeth and she has at least one
loose tooth on the top left side of the mouth. Tanzie was identified by the facility attending veterinarian as having
“moderate to severe tartar” in March 2020. Tanzie has not been treated for this condition since the diagnosis in March.
Accumulation of tartar can lead to dental disease resulting in infected gums, tooth loss, and possible secondary systemic
effects. The presence of loose teeth at this time is a potential source of pain which may affect Tanzie’s ability to eat, and
can have a negative impact on quality of life.
Immediately after concluding the inspection, the licensee contacted the attending veterinarian and scheduled an
appointment for a dental cleaning in early January.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
