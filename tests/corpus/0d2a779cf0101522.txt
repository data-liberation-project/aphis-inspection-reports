ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were three Pomeranians with matted hair and feces handing from the back of their legs. A brown and white
female id# 0A02515552, a white female id # 0A02515831 and a brown male id#0A02514836. Matted hair on the
dog can cause discomfort & could lead to infection or health problems for that dog. Mobility of the dog could also be
affected with the discomfort or pain associated with matted hair constantly pulling on the skin of the dog. The
potential for the skin to become inflamed or infected exists with continued scratching. Matted hair does not maintain
the same insulating qualities of normally groomed hair. Regular grooming of matted hair is necessary to ensure the
health & well being of all dogs.
Inside the whelping building, there was a container of outdated Pyrantel Pamoate expiration date October 2012.
This medication was intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore
ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable
veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and
expected results when expired drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated.
The licensee must ensure that all medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date. To be
