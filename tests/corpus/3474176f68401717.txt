SANITATION.
**The humidifer valve/pipe on the south wall of the rabbit room has a significant leak. There was a plastic container
beneath the valve to collect the water. There was approximately 4-5 inches of water in the container.
**Several pipes in the room containing the bottle washer have significant leaks. Plastic containers were placed
beneath the pipes to collect the dripping water. Plastic containers on the floor holding bottles to be used for the
animals were in water from leaking pipes.
**These areas can not be readily cleaned and sanitized due to the leaking pipes which does not facilitate normal
husbandry practices. The well-being of the animals could be compromised due to the inability to keep the areas
clean and sanitized. The valve and pipes should be repaired. The premises should be kept in good repair in order
to facilitate normal husbandry practices.
