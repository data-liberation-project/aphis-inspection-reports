Sanitation.
*** An area between the camel and warty pig enclosure is filled with unused plastic and metal barrels, trash cans, broken
pallets, old plastic bottles, snow fence, wire and some old metal gates. Having unused items stored in this area between
enclosures does not keep the area clean and promotes a breeding and living area for pests. Accumulations of discarded
materials needs to be cleared as necessary to keep the grounds cleaned and promote good housekeeping practices.
