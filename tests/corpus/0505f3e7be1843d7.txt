PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Ten smaller breed dogs, 4 shih tzu and 6 Pekinese, were being housed in enclosures with 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 wire mesh
floors. These dogs were observed with their feet falling through the floor as they walked in their respective
enclosures. This situation can cause discomfort and unnecessary distress as well as possibly lead to injury.
Enclosures must be constructed in a manner which protects the dogs' feet from falling through.
