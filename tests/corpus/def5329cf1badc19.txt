ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At time of inspection male Yorkie microchip # OAO1672652 was noted to have a slight limp on his right front leg. He
was bearing weight on the leg and running around as though the leg was only sensitive at times. Upon examination
a small white mass of tissue was discovered between the toes. The mass was approximately the size of a pencil
lead. The dog when examined did not react as though it was sensitive to touch. The licensee stated that they had
just sprayed and dipped for ticks and the dog had a tick between the toes. The licensee must have this animal
examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis and treatment of the foot was
provided. Any medical records must be made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure
that all animals receive adequate veterinary care to ensure the health and well-being of the dog. To be corrected by

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At time of inspection three enclosures on the east side housing two Yorkies and four Shih TZu's are showing
excessive rust on the metal base tubing of each enclosure. The metal base tubing has completely rusted through
leaving only a portion of the tubing exposed..Excessive rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces which
affects the structural strength of the metal. In addition, the ability to protect the animals from injury could be
questioned. The licensee must ensure that all metal surfaces are structurally sound, kept in good repair and must
protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by 05-08-14.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
