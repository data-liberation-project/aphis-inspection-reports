3.6(a)(2)(v)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
-The outdoor facility housing adult dogs contains ground enclosures with chat-like gravel flooring. The majority of
these outdoor enclosures have flooring that is wet and mud-like in a large portion of the enclosures. According to
the National Weather Service, there had been a light rain, fog and/or mist in the area for much of the previous day
and into the morning of inspection. Many of these enclosures also had large chunks of frozen ice, which had been
removed from the water receptacles and left inside the enclosures to melt. Many of the dogs housed in these
enclosures had dirty and very wet fur mostly on their paws, legs, chest and on abdominal areas. It appeared difficult
for some of the dogs to walk through the enclosures without walking in the wet and muddy flooring. When dogs' hair
coats become wet and dirty it can decrease the comfort and well-being of the animals, increase the risk of
hypothermia as well as increase the risk of skin lesions and other disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that
all primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that all the dogs remain clean and dry. To be corrected
