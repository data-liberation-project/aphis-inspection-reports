SANITATION.
Inside the food storage building near the upper enclosure housing 2 fallow deer is an excess accumulation of alfalfa
lying on the ground. The metal barrel that the sweet feed is stored in, has feed that fallen on to the top of the lid.
Lying on the floor on the right side next to the front entrance is old mouse dropping mixed in with the alfalfa. Mouse
traps are present in the building, but the accumulation of food debris could potentially cause a pest infestation.
These pests can carry infectious disease and contaminate the food which can affect the health and well-being of the
animals. Excess accumulation of food and old mouse droppings does not facilitate good husbandry practices.
Keep all premises (building and grounds) clean and in good repair to protect the health of the animals.
