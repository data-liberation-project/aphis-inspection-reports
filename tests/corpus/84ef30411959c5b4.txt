3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a heavy accumulation of brown and gray matter on the outside surface of the dog doors. There was an
accumulation of hair hanging from the framework supporting the enclosures, under the floors and on other surfaces
inside the building. Surfaces that are not cleaned thoroughly and with enough frequency to prevent accumulation of
matter can increase disease hazards. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned
daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce
disease hazards. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy
generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. Sanitization may be done using any of the methods
provided in Sec. 3.11(b)(3) for primary enclosures.
