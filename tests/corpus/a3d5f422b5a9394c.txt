Notification of change of operation.
On Thursday, July 28, 2022, I arrived at the address given by the registrant on his application. After I knocked on the
door, a different person answered and said that the former occupant is no longer the resident of this address and that she
has lived there for about four months. I then tried calling the registrant but had to leave a voicemail message.

The registrant moved and did not provide new address as required for an inspection to be conducted under the Animal
Welfare Act. Current address and contact information are essential to enforcing the Animal Welfare Act efficiently and
cost-effectively.

The registrant shall notify the Deputy Administrator of Animal Care by certified mail of any change in the name, address,
or ownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as an exhibitor, carrier, or intermediate handler within 10
days after making such change. Send to APHIS Animal Care, 2150 Centre Avenue, Building B, Mailstop 3W11, Fort
Collins, CO 80526.

No exit briefing was given because the registrant was not available and did not return my phone call by the time this report
was finalized.
