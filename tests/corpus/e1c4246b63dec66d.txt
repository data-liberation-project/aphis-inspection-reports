holes/burrows were noted behind the retaining wall for the elk and bison outdoor exhibits and appeared to be
underneath the public sidewalks. One prairie dog was seen sitting at the entrance to a burrow outside of the
primary enclosure wall. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by: October 1, 2018.
