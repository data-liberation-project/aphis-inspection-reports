3.17(b) CRITICAL
CARE IN TRANSIT.
The information below was provided to USDA Animal Care from a Los Angeles County Public Health Veterinarian
(LACPHV) concerning an approximately 6-month-old dog that was transported on May 14, 2019, on flight SU106
Aeroflot Airlines, originating from China. Airway bill number 55500380816. The LACPH veterinarian and CDC
personnel were present at the Aeroflot cargo area when the dog arrived.
A male intact yellow retriever mix displaying neurological signs arrived to the Aeroflot airline cargo area. CDC
personnel denied entry of this dog as a rabies suspect and a LACPHV issued a health order to the airline for this
dog to be seen at a veterinary clinic for evaluation. According to the LACPHV, they cannot rule out rabies and the
dog needed to be quarantined and observed. The dog’s paperwork included a health certificate and rabies
certificate with no information regarding this dog’s neurologic problems.
LACPHV found a veterinary clinic that would be willing to see the dog and quarantine him. The cargo/ intermediate
handler took the dog to an alternate veterinary hospital, but the clinic could not handle the case at that time. The
dog was taken to the Los Angeles City Shelter the following morning by the cargo/intermediate handler and has
since received appropriate veterinary care.
As a registered transporter, it is the responsibility of the carrier to arrange for any needed veterinary care as soon as
possible for any dogs that are in obvious physical distress.
