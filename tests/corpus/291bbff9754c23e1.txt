(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures
***** There are 8 enclosures with approximately 25 dogs that have an excessive amount of fecal matter present.
When asked the licensee's son stated that last Saturday is when the pens were cleaned. Enclosures with excessive
fecal matter allows the dogs fur to become soiled, it attracts flies, other pest and leaves an odor. Excreta and food
waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent the dogs from becoming soiled, to reduce disease
hazards, insects, pests and odor.
To be corrected by the end of the day
