ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A large black male stud llama was not sheared this summer when the other three llamas were sheared as he is not
as easy to handle. Although the hair is not matted, it is very long and heavy over the majority of his body and needs
to be sheared each summer to prevent overheating and to observe the skin condition under the heavy coat. The
veterinarian was contacted during this inspection and states she does not recommend shearing it now this late in
the summer as temperatures are starting to cool down and winters here are cold. The llama will need to be
sheared before the heat of next summer.
One enclosure contains 31 large rabbits with about half of them being long haired rabbits. Many of the long haired
rabbits have some matts in their fur, especially near the rear ends. All rabbits need to have fur matts removed as
matted fur can lead to serious underlying skin lesions.
One white rabbit has a split ear with black crusted edges where it was cut. This rabbit needs to be seen by the
veterinarian to provide treatment for the injured ear. The owner states this is not one of their rabbits as evidently it
was dumped into the enclosure during the night.
To be corrected by 9-3-16.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The enclosure containing 31 rabbits is excessively dirty. Although there are shavings on the concrete floor in the
shelter part of the enclosure, there is feces throughout the shavings with no clean areas for the animals to lie
without being in some feces. The wire on the upper walls and on the large fan is covered in dusty fur. In the
outside area of the enclosure are two large stumps and feces and fur wastes are collecting around the bottom
edges of these, along with feces on top of the stumps. These were removed during the inspection. Rabbit
enclosures are to be kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, spiderwebs, and other debris with periodic cleaning. For
the number of rabbits, this enclosure is not being cleaned thoroughly and often enough to keep the rabbits clean
and prevent potential disease hazards. To be corrected by 9-3-16.
3.129(b)FEEDING.
Food for the 9 fennic foxes is being placed in metal bowls and paper plates under and on top of an elevated shelf.
The board for the shelf is mildew blackened over most of the surface and food is on the shelf. All food receptacles
are to be kept clean and sanitary at all times. The board was replaced during this inpsection.

WATERING.
Water receptacles for the enclosures containing 3 camels and for the 7 mini zebu are dirty and have algae growing
on the sides of the black rubber containers and floating on the top of the water. These water containers are not
being cleaned adequately and often enough as they need to be kept clean and sanitary. In an enclosure containing
4 breeder pigs, the water containers are excessively muddy as the pigs crawl into them. In an enclosure with 3
goats and 4 pot belly pigs, the water source is a small pond which is several feet below normal levels and is
covered over with green algae. These animals are not provided any other water. Clean, potable water must be
provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. If the animals are using the water for
bathing or toileting, then other methods of providing clean water need to be in used. These were corrected during
this inspection.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Several enclosures have excessive amounts of feces in them. A double sided enclosure with two coatimundis has
a 12 inch wide wooden shelf where a food bowl is placed. Almost the entire shelf is covered with fresh and old
caked feces. Several piles of feces are also on the ground.

The enclosure containing one male serval has multiple piles of dried white feces on the dirt floor in the wooden
shelter. There are several areas of dried old feces in the enclosure with the two bobcats. The top of a den box for 5
Patagonian cavies is covered with a layer of dried up chicken feces which could present a health hazard from being
scattered on top of the animals.
All of these enclosures are not being cleaned often enough. Feces and food waste need to be removed often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors. These were all
cleaned during this inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owners.
