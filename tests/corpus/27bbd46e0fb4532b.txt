ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is a 6 month old capuchin female named (cid:28)Elsa(cid:29) that is currently being house by herself. She is not currently
housed in an area where she can see or have any other interaction with another non-human primate. She is
housed in the nursery housing area located by the keeper(cid:25)s office. She is able to see two ferrets and hear several
other animals housed in the same building. Her enrichment plan states that she will have 24hr human contact and
stuffed animals at all times. Inspectors saw keepers verbally engaging with Elsa for short periods of time with no
physical contact. Inspectors did not see a stuffed animal in with Elsa at all during their inspection (approximately 4
hrs.). Young juveniles and individually housed non-human primates that are unable to see or hear other
non-human primates must be provided special attention regarding an enhancement of their enrichment to promote
their psychological wellbeing. Correct by creating an enhanced enrichment plan based on the individual animals
needs and in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are two Japanese Snow Macaques housed together in a primary enclosure that is largely constructed of
wood. The outdoors section of the enclosure has wooden platforms and other surfaces that are not impervious to
water and have a heavy accumulation of dust, dirt and debris. The indoor section of the enclosure is constructed
primarily of solid wooden walls that are no longer impervious to water and cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized.
Solid surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can harbor bacteria and promote bacteria growth if it is not
removed when it becomes worn or soiled. Correct by cleaning all areas of the enclosures as often as necessary to
prevent accumulation of organic material and other excreta. Additionally, remove or replace worn or soiled surfaces
that cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized.
