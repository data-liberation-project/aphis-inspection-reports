PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
On June 20, 2017, seven male French Bulldog puppies housed in two IATA-approved pet crates/enclosures arrived
at the Miami International Airport (MIA) on Lufthansa flight 0223; the consignee's representative stated the puppies
were imported for resale. All seven puppies were accepted at the port of origin, and transported by the air carrier as
passenger cabin pieces (not as regular cargo). One pet crate was observed housing four puppies, and the other
crate was housing three puppies.
The air carrier shouldn't had transported all seven puppies in just two crates/enclosures. No more than two live
puppies or kittens, 8 weeks to 6 months of age, that are of comparable size, and weighing 20 lbs (9 kg) or less
each, may be transported in the same primary enclosure when shipped via air carrier. The air carrier should had
used four crates to transport the seven puppies, and in that way provide safety and adequate/needed space.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
