Facilities, outdoor.
There were several areas along the western side of the perimeter fence which were maintained below the required height
of 6 feet for the species housed at this facility. Some sections ranged from 5ft 3in to 5ft 6 in in height. Outdoor housing
facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out.
A perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a
secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence must be at least 6 feet in height.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
