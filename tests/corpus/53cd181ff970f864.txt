2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1213 on
20-Jun-17. We went to the house and knocked on the door. A relative answered. She didn't know where the
licensee was at and advised me to call his phone. I called the licensee up. He was unavailable for inspection. I
told him we would try back another time.
End of report.
