INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In the "Use of Canines in Veterinary Technology Courses/Labs" protocol, the procedures for the placement of a
stomach tube, buccal mucosal bleeding time (BMBT), cystocentesis, and placing a male urinary catheter all
reference the use of "anesthetized patients". However, in the anesthesia procedures listed in the protocol, they are
only specified for pelvic radiographs, orchiectomies, ovariohysterectomies, and dentals.
In the "Use of Felines in Veterinary Technology Courses/Labs" protocol, the procedures for BMBT and
cystocentesis also reference "anesthetized patients" but anesthesia procedures specified in this protocol are only
for orchiectomies, ovariohysterectomies, and dentals.
A complete description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to the animals will be limited is to
be included in proposals involving animals covered for research/teaching purposes. Not specifying these
procedures can lead to inadequate/improper anesthesia being administered, which could result in pain or distress to
the animals involved.
Correct by updating anesthesia procedures for animals who are to be anesthetized for for teaching purposes.
Correct by June 18, 2018.
