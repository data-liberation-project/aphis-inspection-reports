FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Mule Deer enclosure: There was a 2ft long and 2 inch wide gap at the bottom and between wooden wall panels of
the shelter structure. Also, visible through this gap on the inside of the shelter were two protruding nails on a
wooden support beam. Gaps or openings in the enclosures and sharp, protruding objects present an injury hazard
to the animals.
Pig pen: An approximate 1.5ft long section of wire fencing has partially detached from a ragged, worn wooden
support beam. This has created an approximate 3 inch gap which can be easily widened with manual pressure.
The presence of fencing gaps and decreased structural strength creates a potential for injury to the animals or
escape.
All parts of all enclosures must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain them
securely. A system of maintenance and repair must be in place.

FEEDING.
Llama pen: There were two large piles of fruit (mostly bananas) on the ground freely available for the seven llamas.Also, there was an increased presence of flies/insects on and around the area of the fruit. Feeding excess amounts
of one diet item can result in preferential feeding with the llamas failing to consume a necessary balanced diet to
ensure the normal daily requirements are met for their species. Excessive piles of food left on the ground also
increase the possibility of contamination from insects, rodents and birds. The diet should be free from
contamination, nutritionally balanced and of adequate quantity to maintain all animals in good health.

SANITATION.
Goat enclosure: A shelter structure in the outdoor, primary enclosure had an excessive buildup of excreta on the
ground and mixed within the straw bedding. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained and to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of
this enclosure should be more frequent and effective to prevent the buildup of excreta.
