FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure with two adult Patagonian cavies has an area where feet could go through chain link fencing. The
cavy enclosure has chain link fencing underneath the enclosure to prevent escape from digging; however, there are
two holes (approximately 1 foot in diameter) underneath the enclosure in which the cavies(cid:25) feet could easily pass
through the chain link fencing. Feet or legs can become injured if an animal becomes entangled in the chain link
fencing. Mulch was placed to fill in the hole underneath the fencing at the time of exit. The issue was corrected at
time of exit.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
