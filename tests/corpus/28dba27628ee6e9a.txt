Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Inspectors observed that pig number 55945 had a grade 1/3 right hind lameness. The caretakers had been in the room
about an hour earlier and had not noticed the lameness in this sow. Daily observation forms in the room had no indication
of the lameness being noticed. Failure to observe and document medical problems and/or communicate those problems
to a veterinarian can result in prolonged pain, suffering, and even death. The facility must observe all animals daily and
then ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate
information on problems of health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed. The clinical veterinarian accompanying the
inspectors agreed that the sow was mildly lame and initiated treatment.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
