WATERING.
A tiger the name Quincy was found with no water available in his enclosure, also no water was available for the 2
black bears and 2 wolves in their enclosures. When the bears were offered water they drank eagerly. It was not
possible to add water to the tiger or the wolves at the time of the inspection to check the level of thirst.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health
and comfort of the animal. Frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the
animal.

No access to the water in the high temperatures of the summer can induce dehydration of the animals. .Correct by: Immediately

SANITATION.
Most of the enclosures containing the 5 tigers, 3 lions, and 2 Bears had an accumulation of feces and food waste.
The facility apparently has not been cleaned for one week.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
Accumulation of feces and food waste can attract pests, insects and other wildlife that can transmit infections and
parasites with the subsequent risk to the health and wellbeing of the regulated animals.
