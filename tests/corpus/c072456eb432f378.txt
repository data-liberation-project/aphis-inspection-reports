PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The adult male Olive baboon enclosure has several sharp points from a section of wire mesh that was cut to hang a
water bottle on the outside. The ends of the wire fencing around the cut-out section has numerous loose wire ends,
some pointing inside the enclosure. No lacerations were observed on the animal. Surfaces in the housing facilities
of non-human primates must be free of jagged edges and sharp points that may injure the animal. Sharp wire ends
can cause lacerations to the skin and be broken off and ingested. Correct by ensuring that these sharp edges are
removed or made inaccessible to any animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**There were several sharp wires pointing inside animal enclosures. The goat enclosure had several wires that had
broken off the enclosure fence at one end and were sticking inside the enclosure.
**The enclosure housing two adult brown bears has a severely rusted metal support bar in the enclosure. The 3ft
long (approximately) bar was located at the bottom of the fence roughly 2-3 inches off the ground and located on
the East side of the enclosure. The inside of the hollow bar was completely exposed due to one side had completely
rusted away or the edges pulled back. The entire length of the bar had two sharp, jagged rusted edges that span
the entire length of the bar. The two bears inside the enclosure have access to the sharp edges. There was an
additional support bar on the outside of the enclosure fencing at the bottom.
No lacerations were observed on any of the animals. Sharp points or jagged edges could cause injury and pain to
an animal. Loose wires are also more likely to break off and be eaten or stepped on. Additionally, facilities must be
in good repair; however, the disintegrating metal bar in the bear enclosure is not. While currently it does not seem to
have impacted the ability to contain the animals, it may eventually lead to an unable to properly enclose them.
Correct by ensuring all housing facilities must protect the animals from injury and is in good repair. Furthermore,
monitor all wire fences and enclosures to ensure loose wires are removed and could not harm any animals. REMAINS UNCORRECTED

SEPARATION.
The licensee informed inspectors that a 1-year old female cougar was found dead inside the den a few days ago.
He stated that he believed her death resulted from injuries sustained by the other 1-year old female cougar housed
in the same enclosure. An accurate or precise date of the animal(cid:25)s death could not be established. According to
the licensee, the cougar was found inside the den with bite marks on the neck along with wood splinters around the
mouth. Although the licensee stated he did not see the fight / death occur, he believes that during the night a mouse
or chipmunk was inside a wall of the den box and one cougar was trying to get the small animal out of the wall when
a fight between the two cougars occurred. The licensee found a hole and parts of the wood paneling inside of the
den along with the dead cougar the following morning. The licensee stated that the AV had seen the body of the
dead cougar and determined it was due to the other cougar. The AV later informed inspectors that the he had not
seen the cougar(cid:25)s body and only heard about the incident the day of inspection (29 January). According to the
licensee the body of this cougar was buried on the premises. Additionally, the licensee stated he was already
separating the two cougars during feeding times due to food aggression; however, the only way to separate these
animals was to lock one in the unlighted den box area while the other remained in the rest of the primary enclosure.
The licensee failed to properly recognize that this aggression maybe expressed during other times particularly since
both animals were found to be significantly underweight at the time of the previous inspection. When food
resources are scare, aggression resulting from competition for food is significantly increased. Additionally it is
important to have an appropriate method to separate animals should unexpected aggression occur. All animals
housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. Animals may not be housed with or near others that
cause distress, discomfort, or otherwise interfere with their health. Correct by ensuring that all animals are housed
only in compatible groups and monitored to assess for signs of aggression. Correct from this day forward.
