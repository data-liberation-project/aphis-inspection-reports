RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility lacks Form 7005 records for puppies born on the premises. There is a note on the dam's registration
page when pups were born and how many, but individual records of each puppy and their assigned ID number are
not present. Accurate and complete records are necessary to obtain information in the event of a disease outbreak.
Licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information.
APHIS Forms 7005 shall be maintained which include offspring born at the facility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The feed storage room is in disarray. Mice have eaten into a bag of feed resulting in spilled feed accumulating
under the stored bags of dog food. Dog food, mouse droppings and other debris are scattered across the floor in
the feed storage room. The hole the mice were using to enter the room has been repaired, but the room has not yet
been cleaned. Spilled feed attracts rodents which may carry and spread diseases. Supplies of food and bedding
must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The
feed storage room must be cleaned.
