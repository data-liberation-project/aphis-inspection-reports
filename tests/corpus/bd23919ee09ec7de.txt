2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, female blue and white Italian Greyhound with number 933 has ongoing dental disease that has not been
addressed. The gum line over the upper right large premolar tooth is red and recessed away from the tooth surface.
This large upper right premolar tooth is loose. The gum line over the lower left premolar teeth is recessed and one
lower premolar tooth is loose. The front of the lower jaw is able to be moved when the two lower canine teeth are
gently manipulated. The two lower canine teeth can be slightly moved toward each other. There is dark brown
material coating the upper right large premolar tooth and the lower left premolar teeth. There is a small amount
white, creamy debris at the base of the lower left premolar teeth. The license stated that she believed that to be
paper from the bedding. This dog is currently not receiving any medication or other treatment. The licensee had
been giving this dog "(cid:28)Plaque Off"(cid:29) food additive and "Tylan" Powder in the water through the end of the month of
April.
Adult, female Schnauzer with number 653 has ongoing dental disease that has not been addressed. The gum line
over the upper premolar teeth of both sides is recessed away from the surface of the teeth. The roots of the large
upper premolar teeth are exposed on both sides. One of the small upper premolar teeth is loose on the right side.
One of the small upper premolar teeth and the large upper premolar tooth is loose on the left side. There is a gray
discharge along the gum line of the lower right premolars. This dog is not currently receiving any medication or
other treatment. The licensee had been giving this dog "(cid:28)Plaque Off(cid:29)" food additive through the end of the month of
April. These dogs were evaluated by the attending veterinarian (AV) on 26 April 2016. For the Italian Greyhound
number 933, the documentation provided by the AV states: (cid:28)Has few teeth. Some plaque. Not enough teeth left to
justify full anesthesia. Suggested (Licensee) do it herself.(cid:29) For the Schnauzer with number 653, the documentation
provided by the AV states: (cid:28)Recessed gums (cid:19) O L side. Doubt the scaler would even work. Suggested (Licensee)
use the sedative Dr. (Previous AV) dispensed and just clean them.(cid:29)
When asked about her plan for addressing these dogs, the licensee stated that she planned to watch the teeth and
at some point use the hand scaler to scrape the calculus from the teeth. She did not have a time planned to start
this. When asked what she planned to do for the dental disease -(cid:19) the loose teeth, recessed gums, and jaw
problems - (cid:19) the licensee stated that she believed that the loose teeth would fall out when they fell out. The licensee
also stated that the AV told her that the loose teeth could be removed but that she told the AV that she did not wantto do that. Loose teeth, recessed and red gums are some of the signs of dental disease in dogs. Dental disease
can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures (such as bone loss in the jaw), be painful, and
impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The animals listed above must
be re-examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and
followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented
and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee was reminded that the use of sedatives,
anesthesia, and an ultrasonic dental scaler by the licensee to address the dental disease was only permissible with
a licensed veterinarian present for the procedure.
