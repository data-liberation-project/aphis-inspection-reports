3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
- At the time of inspection, there was an excessive accumulation of excreta in the guinea pig cages. The presence
of excessive feces in the enclosure increases environmental contamination and may have a negative impact on the
health and welfare of the enclosed animals. Enclosures must be cleaned as often as needed to prevent
accumulation of excreta. This affects at least 12 enclosures.
