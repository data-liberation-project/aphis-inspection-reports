ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Although records documenting veterinary care for animals off-site were reviewed, the facility was not able to provide
record of the visit to the premises by the attending veterinarian in 2015 or to date in 2016.
Lack of regularly scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian might prevent the veterinarian from observing
animals and their current housing conditions to determine proper care for the health and well-being of the animals
The facility must comply with the written program of veterinary care which stated that the veterinarian will visit the
facility annually.
