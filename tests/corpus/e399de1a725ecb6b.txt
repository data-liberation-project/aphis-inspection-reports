HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There is an open bag of primate chow in the refrigerator. Open bags of feed shall be placed in sealed containers
to protect from contamination. The labels placed on the food containers for smaller distribution do not currently
include the expiration dates or the date opened. These items shall be properly labeled to prevent the feeding of
expired or denatured food. The hay, straw and wood wool are stored on pallets that are currently directly on the
wall. There is no open space between the wall and supplies. Adequate air circulation is necessary to prevent
molding and deterioration. The ground around the pallets on the walls cannot be adequately viewed or accessed
for cleaning. Storage areas shall be arranged in a manner that will protect the food from contamination and allow
cleaning.
