3.1(c)(2) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
During inspection there were visible gaps and missing floor tile pieces in flooring of the south room, back entry and the
kitchen areas of the house where dogs are allowed to roam.
Broken and loose flooring with exposed gaps may allow moisture, urine and excreta to build up between or underneath
the floor surface and floor tiles. This makes it difficult to adequately clean and sanitize those floor areas in which dogs are
being kept.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized, must be
replaced when worn or soiled.
Non-compliance under 3.1(c)(2) has been previously cited on previous inspections and reports dated 26 MAY 2022, 04
DEC 2019, 21 AUG 2019.
3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Buildup of grime and debris is present on floor in the south room, kitchen and back entry area of the house where dogs
are kept and allowed to roam. There is accumulation of grime and dirt also on the interior surface of the back door. Nine
dogs were present and freely roaming in the house at the time of inspection.


Buildup of grime and debris on surfaces makes it difficult to adequately clean and sanitize the affected surfaces.
Primary enclosures and enclosure furnishings used for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of
the methods prescribed in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt,
debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
Non-compliance under 3.11 (b)(2) was previously identified on previous inspections and reports dated 26 MAY 2022, 16
JUNE 2021, 25 MARCH 2021 and 04 DECEMBER 2019.
