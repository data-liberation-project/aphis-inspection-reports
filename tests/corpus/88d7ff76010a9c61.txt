RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
** The licensee could not locate the records of animals on hand at the time of the inspection. These records
included a new acquisition of an African crested porcupine. In addition there was no records noted for a porcupine
and three opossums that had died/left the facility. These records are a requirement and must be maintained in a
timely and accurate manner and available for review by an APHIS official at the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Several of the enclosures have sections of the fencing that is not buried in the ground which could be a potential
hazard to the animals, if they get a foot or leg caught in the wire mesh. In addition a few of the enclosures have top
mesh that is sagging into the enclosure and need to be tightened to keep the enclosure structurally sound. These
enclosures need to be maintained in good repair for the safety and containment of the animals.
*** The new fox pens currently have a tarp secured over the top of the enclosure. Foxes are excellent climbers and
have the potential to get out of the tarp cover. A permanent top over the enclosure needs to be in place for the
containment of the animals.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** The opossums have been moved into the barn in stacking stainless steel enclosures. The enclosures do not
provide sufficient space to allow the opossums adequate freedom of movement. Opossums are semi arboreal
animals and need to have some vertical space to climb and engage in this normal adjustment. In addition these are
active nocturnal animals and will walk extended periods of time. One opossum was walking in a circle and pushing
the hay around the enclosure. If not given enough space this circling could become an abnormal behavior pattern.
These animals need to be provided an enclosure that provides provide sufficient for their health and well being. Correct by: Jan 30, 2016
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
*** Recently the licensee has been using Styrofoam bowls to place food in for animal feeds. The bowls have been
left in the pens and accumulated and have been chewed. These bowls can be a potential hazard to the animals if
the Styrofoam is ingested while the animals are eating. The use of these bows should be discontinued and food
receptacles that are used should be able to be cleaned and sanitized for the health of the animals.

3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** The facility has a lot of miscellaneous items, clutter and trash in the main area around animal enclosures. This is
creating areas for pests to live and does not promote good housekeeping practices.
*** The barn is currently housing the opossums and an African crested porcupine. The area directly around the
animals needs to be cleared out of any clutter and items that do not pertain directly to the husbandry of the animals.
This is to keep the area in good repair and facilitate good housekeeping practices.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
*** Based on the last two reports it is apparent that the facility needs additional help to care for the animals. The
licensee left the facility to travel to IL and when arrived home did not have the facility set up in her absence to
properly house the 9 foxes that returned with her. The foxes remained in travel crates for extended periods of time
while enclosures were build. In addition, other areas of the facility could not be addressed because all the licensee's
energy was focused on building enclosures. The animals were fed in her absence but were not able to be cleaned
and the Styrofoam bowls were not removed promptly as she is the primary care taker. The licensee is caring for
regulated animals as well as rehabilitated animals not listed on records. Based on the amount of animals and
facilities to care for, additional personal need to be brought in and trained to maintain the professionally acceptable
level of husbandry practices.
