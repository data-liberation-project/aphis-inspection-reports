Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
There were changes made to 2 protocols by the investigators that had not been reviewed and approved by the IACUC or
the attending veterinarian. The first protocol included a terminal blood collection of ferrets. The approved protocol,
PROTO201800250 dated 5/12/21, specified sedation with ketamine at a dosage of 10-30 mg/kg. However, on 5/6/22 it
was discovered a higher dosage was being utilized in the study than in the approved protocol during investigation of 2
ferrets that died after sedation and prior to euthanasia after terminal blood collection. The cause of death of the 2 ferrets
was undetermined. The IACUC reviewed the matter and approved an amendment to the protocol dated 6/28/22 which
increased the dosage of ketamine to 20-50 mg/kg. There were no further deaths of ferrets reported after the protocol
change. The second protocol, PROTO202001688 dated 1/21/21, specified capture of a particular species of vole,
southern red-backed voles, for use in a study. However, on 7/8/22, it was discovered that, in addition to red-backed
voles, another species of vole, meadow voles, were also captured and used in the study. The IACUC reviewed the matter
and approved an amendment to the protocol dated 8/2/22 which changed the study to include capture of voles to include
any species.
Making changes to a protocol without seeking IACUC review and approval does not allow the IACUC to perform adequate
oversight into the use of animals for medical research.


Correct by 11/11/22 by allowing the IACUC to review and either approve, require modifications in, or withhold approval of
proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC representative.
