ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was tan male Pug (0A02582015) with hair loss and circular-like skin lesions in the regions of the right hip
and near the base of the tail. The areas of hair loss were oblong in shape and extended beyond the reddened skin
lesions located within the regions of hair loss. The lesions appeared to be reddened and scabbed. The two hair loss
areas were approximately ½ inch diameter and had a few smaller, pinpoint sized lesions near it. The licensee was
not aware of the dog's condition prior to the inspector pointing it out. This dog's condition could be due to an injury,
infection or a variety of other veterinary medical conditions. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian
regarding this dog's condition in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment
plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
