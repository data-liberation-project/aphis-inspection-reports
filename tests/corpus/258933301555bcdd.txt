A male macaque was injured on 10/5/2020 when a larger male accessed his enclosure due to an inadequately secured
divider. The technician was attempting to dislodge a toy stuck in a mechanism and was distracted from noting the
macaque breaching the divider. The larger male attacked the smaller one, but was quickly separated by replacing the
divider. The AV was immediately called, and the injured animal was sedated and treated for his wounds. He has since
recovered.
The facility must ensure there are enough adequately trained employees to ensure safe handling of the NHPs while
performing husbandry tasks.
This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by reviewing and revising procedures and retraining personnel, ensuring
they know to communicate to others if there is a situation that may distract them while performing their duties so it can be
appropriately addressed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
