FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelter housing the lama and the shelter housing the four alpacas did not contain enough bedding. The
expected low temperature in the area for tonight is three degrees. Failure to provide adequate bedding will lead to
discomfort and possible animal injury. This will lead to unnecessary animal suffering. Adequate bedding must be
provided to these animals to provide for their health and comfort. Provide more bedding for these animals.

WATERING.
APHIS inspectors began an inspection at about 1:00 PM. All of the enclosures housing the tigers and the enclosure
housing one lion had water containers which appeared to be filled to the top with solid ice. The facility president
stated that all the animals had received water at about 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM in the morning. In order to evaluate the
animals' desire for water, APHIS inspectors asked that all of the tigers and the lion be offered water while they were
present. Lenny and Squiggy are two tigers that are housed together. When they were offered water, they both
drank continuously for about 60 seconds. A tiger named JJ drank continuously for about 50 seconds when offered
water. This is longer than normal for animals that have adequate water available to them. It is vital that all animals
have access to water in order to promote their health and comfort. Cats are particular sensitive to kidney damage
from lack of water. Provide enough water as often as necessary to keep these animals comfortable. These animals
are suffering due to lack of adequate water.
This focused inspection was conducted to evaluate the five non-compliant items listed as directs on the facilty
inspection of 3-4-14.
The tiger known as Kahn has received adequate veterinary care at the time of inspection. The veterinarian saw him
on the afternoon of 3-4-14. The veterinarian explained to the inspector by phone call that he wished to have a
follow up visit with Kahn in five to six days.
The direct item listed under 3.83 has been corrected. At the conclusion of the inspection, APHIS inspectors went over their findings. All non-compliances were described
in full to the facility president. APHIS inspectors also explained that they will need to see documentation of the
attending veterinarian's follow up visit to see the tiger Kahn. A formal exit interview was conducted on 3-6-14.
