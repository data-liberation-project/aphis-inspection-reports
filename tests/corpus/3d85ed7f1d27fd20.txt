FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The otter exhibit has a drainage problem that requires daily flushing of the drain in order to properly clean the
enclosure. A strong odor is readily detectable upon entering the underwater viewing area of the otter exhibit. This
drainage problem needs to be repaired to eliminate foul odors and the eventual back up of drainage waste into the
otter exhibit. A regular program of facility maintenance needs to be in place to ensure the proper functioning of all
facility components.
