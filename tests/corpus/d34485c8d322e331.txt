2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility did not have an updated program of veterinary care available for review on today’s inspection. The current
program of veterinary care does not include the hedgehog, cow, or White Tail deer.
The written program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the attending
veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the written program of
veterinary care is available for review during all USDA inspections.
3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The current housing structure in the outdoor dog pen is constructed of painted and wooden surfaces that are not
impervious to moisture. Building structures made of unsealed wood cannot be properly cleaned or sanitized when
permeable to moisture. The applicant must ensure that all structures the dog comes in contact with are impervious to
moisture and able to be readily cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they become worn or soiled.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.



All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by June 20th, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
