FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are areas in the facility that are in disrepair. In the enclosure housing the adult female tiger "Kiara," there is a
section of concrete flooring next to the shift gate that is cracked and crumbling. Broken areas of floor can potentially
injure or trap an animal, and also make it more difficult to adequately clean and sanitize the enclosure. This area
must be repaired and properly maintained.
In the enclosure housing a male goat, "Rocky," the welded wire panels around the fencing is loose, especially
around the bottom, and has some broken areas as well. These loose sections can cause a leg or horn to get
entangled and potentially cause injury to the animal. The affected fencing must be repaired or replaced.
All facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In an enclosure housing a one year old female tiger,"Naula," the dirt floor is completely muddy with standing
puddles of water throughout. There is a large hole in front of the door that is full of water. The tiger's food and
water are located in the muddy areas.
The tiger had no dry area inside the enclosure except the concrete shelter that she sleeps in. Standing water and
mud are a potential source of discomfort and contamination, and can have a negative impact on the health and
welfare of the enclosed animal. Animals must have areas where they can stay dry and comfortable, and should be
able to access food and water without having to stand in muddy areas.
The large hole in front of the door needs to be filled in, and an effective drainage system needs to be in place to
rapidly drain excess water.

3.131(c)
SANITATION. Inside the adult female tiger's (Kiara) enclosure, there is a shift cage that is no longer being used. The interior area
of this cage is not being properly maintained, allowing heavy overgrowth of weeds and plants.
Excessive weed growth in close proximity to animals can create a habitat for insects, rodents and other vermin
which may cause injury or contamination to the enclosed animal. The weeds must be removed, and this cage
properly maintained.
The premises must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the health of the animals.
