3.125(b)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The enclosure housing one bison has two areas where the wire fencing closest
to the ground is detached and pushed outward. The fourth section on the left side has the lower right corner
detached from the wood fence post. The fourth section in the back to the right of the shelter has the lower edge of
the wire fencing pulled apart. The bison may be injured pushing on the damaged fencing. The fencing must be
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animal from injury. Correct by repairing or replacing
the wire fencing. Correct by April 9, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility vice president.
