FEEDING.
Three primary enclosures containing two dogs each had feeders that contained moldy food. The eighth kennel on
the left hand side and the third kennel on the right hand side containing Yorkshire Terriers showed a collection of
moldy food in the corner of both the feeders. The primary enclosure in the middle of the kennel containing two
Havenees has a large rusty feeder with cobwebs in the corner. Mold is on the tray of the feeder and moldy food is
scattered along the tray.
The second kennel on the left hand side which contains no dogs also had moldy food left in the feeder.
Food must be provided at least once a day and be uncontaminated, wholesome, and palatable. The food
receptacles must be kept clan and be sanitized at least every two weeks or more often if necessary.
Proper nutrition and a clean environment is necessary to ensure optimal animal health.
Correct by July 28th, 2017 by cleaning and sanitizing the feeders and providing the dogs with uncontaminated food.
