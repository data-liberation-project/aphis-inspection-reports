2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
***This was a second complaint inspection, as the owner of the establishment has animals on exhibit to the public
without a valid USDA license. On 3/3/15, the APHIS VMO contacted the owner via telephone regarding his
operation of a mobile petting zoo "Tyler's Petting Zoo and Pony Rides". The owner stated he was returning from a
children's birthday party where he had been exhibiting his animals when the incident on 2/21/15 occurred. APHIS
VMO explained to the owner that exhibiting animals to the public in this manner requires a valid USDA license.
An initial complaint inspection was conducted on 5/28/14 with the owner, an Arizona Department of Game and Fish
officer and APHIS VMO. At that time, the owner was operating a mobile petting zoo under the name "Noah's Ark
Petting Zoo and Pony Rides". It was determined and informed to the owner, that a valid USDA license was required
for public exhibition of his animals. He was given an application packet at that time but has not since submitted an
application.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale, except persons
who are exempted from the licensing requirements under section 2.1 (a)(3), must have a valid license.
Acquire a valid USDA license if you wish to continue to exhibit animals to the public.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
Conducting regulated activities without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
