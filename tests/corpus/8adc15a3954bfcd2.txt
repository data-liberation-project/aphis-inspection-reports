ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A goat at the facility has an area on its front right shoulder about an inch in diameter that is raised and hairless.
When the animal caretaker evaluated it and put light pressure on it a thick white discharge came out of it. These
are signs of an infection/abscess which can be caused by many different things. Such condition can sometimes be
painful for an animal and can potentially be spread to other animals in the enclosure. To maintain good health of
this goat and those around it a veterinarian must examine it and his/her recommended treatment(s) must be
followed.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Daily observation of all animals...
A goat has a raised hairless area on its front shoulder that has signs of an infection/abscess in it (a pale discharge
was present). The facility was not aware of this condition on the goat until I pointed it out to the animal caretaker.
Thorough daily observations of animals must be completed by the facility so that any abnormal health condition may
be promptly recognized and reported to the attending veterinarian. Develop and maintain a routine of observing
animals daily and report any abnormal conditions promptly to the attending veterinarian.
