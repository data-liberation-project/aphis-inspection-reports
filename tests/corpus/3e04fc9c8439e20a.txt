PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The kennel has plastic pipes around the outside of each enclosure inside the fence to contain the gravel used.
Some of these pipes have become disconnected and are open to the weather, with some also sticking up in the air,
these pipes and the debri they hold inside can harbor vermin fleas etc. These pipes need to be maintained and
constructed in a way that they remain structurally sound or are completely covered and are not open to the weather
giving vermin a protected place to live.
This needs to be corrected and maintained by Jan 1 2015
