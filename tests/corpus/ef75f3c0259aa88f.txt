(a) Structural strength.
***In the drive through area, barn #3 was available shelter for primarily eight Watusi, eight Elk, one Camel, three
Potbelly Pigs and one Black Hawaiian Sheep. Deer roam the zones freely. This barn had become dilapidated
around the doorway. The 2"x6" board at the bottom of the entranceway was detached from the posts and pushed
outward from the barn separating the front wall from the framework. On the right side of the entranceway the wall
was detached approximately 12" at the bottom and was still slightly attached at the top. The gap contained nails that
created sharp points.
***Barn #9 was available shelter for at least fifteen Cattle, one Camel, one Nilgai, two Eland, nine Pere David, ten
Alpaca, five Horses and two Donkeys. The roof on this barn was completely destroyed in the back left corner.
Almost every board on the under side of the roof was wet from the recent rains. The entire ground beneath this roof
was standing in water and the plyboard walls were wet from the ground level up to approximately two feet.
Structures that are not structurally sound increase the risk of injury to the animals. The licensee must remove,
replace or repair these barns and assure that all of the facility and shelters are structurally sound as required.

(c) Storage.
***Round bales of hay being used for feed, had been stacked for storage in the southwest end of the open parking
lot. This hay arrived at the facility approximately at the beginning of May. There had been enough rain in June and
July to cause flooding in the area. The hay bales were no longer holding shape due to the amount of water and
weight. The bottom row of bales were standing in water and all of the bales were wet and mold could be seen on
most of the bales. Feed that is left in the open environment increases the risk of contamination by availability to the
elements.
The licensee must dispose of this molded wet hay appropriately and assure that all feed is stored in a manner to
reduce the risk of contamination as required.3.125(d)

(d) Waste disposal.
***In the drive through area, there were at least nine barns used for shelter that had wet and dried animal waste that
was up against the walls of the barns. In barn #3 the manure was so packed inside the barn, it had pushed the
2"x6" board at the bottom of the entrance away from the barn and detached the walls from the framework. It was
also pushing out the pig doors so that they would not shut correctly. Excessive amounts of animal waste increases
the risk of illness and injury to the animals by creating a harboring place for pests and potentially damaging
structures. The licensee must remove the animal waste from the barns and assure that this material is disposed of
as required.
To be corrected by July 25, 2015.

(b) Shelter from inclement weather.
***In Zone 3 there was one barn (#3) that was available to shelter eight Watusi, eight Elk, one Camel, three Potbelly
Pigs, one Black Hawaiian Sheep and any number of approximately 208 Fallow and Sika deer that are allowed to
roam all three zones freely. This was the only barn in this zone that was available to these animals. This barn
measured 10'x16'. The height of the back of inside back of this barn measured 4' 7". There is some natural
protection from tall trees and gulleys, yet this is the only man-made structure in this zone. This barn is not large
enough to provide protection from the elements to all of the animals in this zone. Inadequate shelter allows animals
to become exposed to the elements, which can affect their health and comfort. The licensee must provide adequate
shelter to each of these animals to protect them from climate extremes and assure that all of the animals are
provided with shelter as required.

(c) Drainage.
***In the drive through area, all of the shelter barns had standing water at the entrance and under the shelters from
the recent rains. At least three barns had wet ground 2'-3' underneath the sheltered area. Barn #8 had been usedas a "catch barn," yet was open and available for entry to all the animals in Zone 1 as a Nilgai was observed exiting
the barn on the inspector's arrival. The entranceway was standing in water and mud and a hoof print at this area
measured 7" deep. The ground on the north end of this barn was completed flooded and the south end was wet.
Barn #9 was also available to the animals in Zone 1 and the ground was completely covered in water underneath
the sheltered portion. There were five other "breeding barns" in Zone 1, yet barns #8 and #9 were open for the
animals to enter. Standing water and excessively muddy shelters or enclosures can affect the animals feet, cause
the animals to be wet, cold or injured. The licensee must provide a way to rapidly eliminate the water from these
areas and assure that all animal areas are drained of excess water as required.
3.129(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
***The hoofstock in the walk through area and the drive through area were being fed wet, molded hay. These hay
bales had black material aproximately 2" thick around the outside. There were also mineral blocks setting in
receptacles throughout the drive through area that were wet from recent rains. Wet, molded feed and supplements
increase the risk of illness to the animals from eating contaminated feed. The licensee must remove molded hay
from the hay racks and enclosures and assure that all feed is free from contamination as required.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
***In the drive through area, there were at least seven hay racks. Approximately 10'-20' around the hay racks, the
ground is completely wet from recent rains and covered with molded hay, manure and mud. The facility
representative stated that these racks get moved once a week. The racks were being moved just far enough to set
outside the muddy area where they had been setting. This movement of these racks did not allow the animals to
completely move out of the area where the hay, manure and mud covered the ground. Also, the mineral blocks
were setting in receptacles that were left open to the environment. Leaving hay racks in close proximity of the last
setting attracts the pest from the old feed and animal waste on the ground. Leaving supplement blocks exposed to
the elements can attract pests and increases the risk of the blocks to become wet and contaminated. The licensee
must assure that all feed and supplement receptacles are placed as to reduce the risk of contanimation as required.
Facility representative understands that this is to be corrected from this day, July 9, 2015 forward.
This inspection began at 0900.
This was a focus inspection of feed and barns.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative and Beverly Hicks, ACI.
