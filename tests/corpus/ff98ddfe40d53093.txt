3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility has 2 cougars housed in separate enclosures. The perimeter fence surrounding one of the cougar
enclosures has a chain linked fence approximately 5 feet in height topped off with 4 strands of hot wire. The current
set up may not be of sufficient height or strength to serve as a secondary containment system and/or to keep
animals or unauthorized persons out.
Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. Perimeter fences for potentially dangerous animals, such as, but not limited to, large
felines (e.g., lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, etc.) should be at least 8 feet in height. The fence must be constructed
so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment
system for the animals in the facility.
