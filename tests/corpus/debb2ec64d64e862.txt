INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The following animal use protocols did not contain an adequate description of the proposed use of the animals:
AN101165-02A - Bioartificial Kidney Device in a Porcine Model - This protocol did not include a description of the
device to be implanted into the pig, such as its size and composition.
AN089826-03B - Dissecting the Neural Control of Social Attachment - This protocol describes how the social
attachment of voles will be evaluated, and in one experiment some animals will be "loosely tethered using plastic
collars..." There is no description of these collars and tethering techniques.
A proposal to conduct activities involving animals must include a complete description of the use of the animal. This
complete description allows the IACUC members, when deciding whether to approve a protocol, to fully understand
the experiences that the animal will undergo, which enables them to request further clarifications and considerations
of alternatives.
The descriptions on these two protocols should be corrected by 9/1/15, with a review to check for complete
description on all other protocols at the time of renewal, and all new protocol proposals, or proposed changes to
existing protocols, to be compliant from this time forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Sixteen rabbits were housed in primary enclosures on the floor. The caging for these enclosures consisted of a wire
mesh or grate that was coated with green plastic. In most of the enclosures the rabbits had chewed off sections of
the plastic coating.
Primary enclosures should be maintained in good repair. Ingesting plastic not designed for enrichment purposes
could be potentially harmful to the health of the rabbits. The irregular surface in the enclosures, with missing
sections of plastic, impedes cleaning and disinfecting.Steps should be taken to assure that all rabbit enclosures are structurally sound and in good repair.
To be corrected by 8/5/15.
An exit interview was completed with university representatives.
