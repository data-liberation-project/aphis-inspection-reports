3.26(d) Repeat

Facilities, indoor.
Interior Surfaces. A wall on the left side of the guinea pig room is still under construction. There is bare wood and
insulation on the lower 4 feet of the wall and plastic sheeting on the upper 5 feet of the wall. Indoor guinea pig facilities
must be constructed and maintained so that surfaces are substantially impervious to moisture, will not retain odors, and
can be readily sanitized. The bare wood, insulation, and plastic sheeting on the left wall must be sealed, replaced, and/or
covered with an impervious surface so the wall surfaces do not absorb moisture and can be readily sanitized when dirty.

Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
