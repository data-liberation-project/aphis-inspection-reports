ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1640 on
28-Mar-19. I went to the facility representative's house. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I contacted
the facility representative and left a message. I did not receive a phone call. I waited 30 minutes and no one
showed up. I then left.
End of report.
