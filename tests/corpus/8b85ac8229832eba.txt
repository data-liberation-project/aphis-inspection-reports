PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Four rabbits are currently being housed in a large black trough like enclosure placed in a barn. The entire top of the
trough is open. Several sections of wire have been added along the top of the rim of the enclosure in areas.
Apparently two of the rabbits jumped out of the enclosure and are currently living under the barn. They were not
observed during this inspection. Rabbits are susceptible to injury and predators when not appropriately housed in a
protected environment.
The escaped rabbits needs to be recaptured and housed in an appropriate enclosure. The rabbit enclosure shall be
structurally sound to protect the rabbits from injury, to contain them and to keep predators out. Correct by 10/13/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
