SANITATION.
Numerous flies were observed on top of the meat, and around the bowl that was placed in the left side bobcat
enclosure. This area does not currently have any type of fly control.
Flies can contaminate the meat, cause discomfort during eating, bite the animal, or may even prevent access to the
food (depending on what type of fly is present).
A safe fly control program shall be established and maintained to reduce the number of flies that were observed in
this area to protect the meat from contamination, and to protect the animal from injury, or discomfort during eating.
