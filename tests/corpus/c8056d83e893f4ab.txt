Facilities, general.
The wood box in with the crested porcupines has been extensively chewed in one area, exposing nail heads which can be
a hazard to the animals. This box must be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals.
3.125(d) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The facility has brought in a large dumpster for waste that is picked up as needed. At the time of the inspection, bedding
and waste from animals including those treated for parasites has built up outside the dumpster which is accessible to
vermin and other wild animals. Disposal of animal waste must be timely to reduce vermin infestation and in compliance
with local laws and regulations pertaining to pollution control and protection of the environment.
3.126(a)

Facilities, indoor.
At the time of the inspection, the ambient temperature outside was 26 deg F. The cavy barn’s temperature was noted to
be 39 deg F with 58% humidity at 9:15 am according to the temperature and humidity log maintained in the barn. There
was one heat lamp on in the back stall. This building had been projected to get a forced air heater that has yet to be
installed. The AV in conjunction with the keeper staff has been working to determine optimal temperatures and humidity
ranges for multiple species of animals at the facility. The cavy temps should be between 40-70 deg F with humidity

projected to be at 70-80%. Multiple dates and times show temperatures falling into the 30’s with low humidity. Despite the
low temperatures being recorded, there is no note of how the facility plans to address the low temperatures to maintain
them in optimal ranges. Temperatures for indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently regulated to protect the animals
from extremes of temperature and provide for their comfort and wellbeing
