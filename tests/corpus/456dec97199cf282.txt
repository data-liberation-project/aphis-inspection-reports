2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility is not utilizing an effective mechanism to identify, convey, or document treatment of veterinary
problems with some of the animals.
**A female Asian elephant, Nina, has been losing weight and in thin body condition since early 2013. This
animal lost 500 lbs during the 7-8 months leading up to the inspection, yet at the time of this inspection,
there was not a mechanism in place to provide timely and accurate information on this animal(cid:25)s health and
well-being to the consulting veterinarian in charge of her veterinary care.
**A female pygmy hippo, Katie, was noted to be losing weight and not doing well while traveling for
exhibition purposes in May 2014. The consulting veterinarian in charge of veterinary care for this animal
was contacted, and the animal was returned to the home facility and evaluated by the veterinarian on
5/22/2014. Medication was prescribed, but there are no records to show if the treatment was given. The
animal was found dead on 11/14/2014 and it was determined on the necropsy that the animal was
suffering from chronic disease, likely related to cardiomyopathy. There is no documentation that weights
were obtained on the animal, and no documentation that the facility made daily observations of her
condition while her health was declining, and communicated those observations to the veterinarian.
Documentation of veterinary conditions, prescribed treatments, and chronic problems that are being
monitored is an important component of a functional program for adequate veterinary care as it provides a
mechanism for communication between animal care staff and the veterinarians, and helps to ensure that
care is provided as directed and that the expected outcome is achieved.
**A male llama, Bandit, was noted to have excessively overgrown hooves such that the toes, especially
right front and left hind, were curving to the sides. The llama was under veterinary care for an eye problem
but there no indication or record that the overgrown hooves had been noted. Excessive growth of hooves
changes the angle of the toes, changes the gait, and can lead to chronic problems in the feet and legs
such as arthritis.Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being may be accomplished by someone
other than the attending veterinarian, provided that a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to
convey timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being to the
attending veterinarian is in place.
The llama "Bandit" shall have his hooves trimmed by 1/10/2015.
An effective mechanism for communication of veterinary conditions, treatment, and daily observations shall
be established and maintained by 1/17/2015.
Inspection conducted with facility representatives and APHIS AC VMO's on 1/5-6/2014. Exit briefing
