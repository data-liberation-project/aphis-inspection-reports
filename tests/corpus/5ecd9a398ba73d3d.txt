3.6(a)(2)(iii) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A female Shiba Inu escaped from her enclosure sometime around March 2018. The licensee is not sure how the
dog escaped from its enclosure. She reached out to her neighbors for assistance in finding the dog. The dog was
seen at one point after its escape, but it was not able to be captured. The dog has not been seen since. A dog that
escapes from its enclosure and leaves the property risks being hit by a car, exposed to wildlife, or contracting a
disease. The licensee must ensure that the enclosures are constructed and maintained so that the dogs are not
able to escape. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
