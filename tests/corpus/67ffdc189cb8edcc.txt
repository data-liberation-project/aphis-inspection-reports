3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The facility is currently housing pigs intended for slaughter and smaller pigs intended for the retail pet trade in
the same kennel area as the dogs. The pigs are part of another business and should be moved to a designated
area to reduce noise, odors and potential diseases hazards from the dogs. Housing facilities for dogs should be
maintained separately to promote good husbandry and housekeeping practices for the dogs.
