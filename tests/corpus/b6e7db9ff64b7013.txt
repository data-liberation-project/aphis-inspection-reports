RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently all of the cage card being used as a 'Puppy Record' for all of the litters is missing the date of sale for 5
litters.
The puppy ID numbers are not consistent from the puppy record to what is on the Disposition 7006 forms. There are
numbers and letters being used to ID the puppies inconsistently, and they are not matching between the 7006 forms
and the puppy records. Some of the 7006 forms are missing the dates of sale.
Compete and accurate records must be kept for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
The licensee must keep complete puppy records for all puppies born at the facility. The puppy ID numbers must be
the
same on the puppy records and 7006 disposition form, and all 7006 forms must have the date of sale on them.
