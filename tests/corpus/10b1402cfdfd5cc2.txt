2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An employee brought a family with children into the drive-thru part of the facility in her car because they were late
and had missed boarding the tour wagon. The family members left the car and walked to the wagon and boarded.
There was no barrier between them and the animals in the park while they walked to the wagon even though there
was a female wildebeest with calf nearby . The employee was charged by the female wildebeest with a calf which
resulted in major injuries requiring hospitalization and surgery. Need to have a sufficient barrier between the public
and animals to assure the safety of the animals and the public. While the public was not injured during this incident,
there was more than minimal risk of harm to them. Correct for all future public interactions.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two capybaras escaped the facility after they were moved to the drive-thru park so they could have access to a
pond. They have been discovered living at a neighbor's nearby pond and attempts are underway to capture them.
The owner stated that they most likely escaped thru a culvert pipe that was not completely covered. All enclosures
should be sufficient to contain the animals and prevent escape.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are still some gaps under the perimeter fence in the drive-thru area and also some in the new zebra/watusi
cattle pasture. There is a large gap under the gate of the drive-thru area next to the road and several smaller gaps
under the fence near the houses outside the facility. Need to ensure all gaps are filled and secure to prevent
entrance of dogs, coyotes, etc. that may chase or injure animals and also to prevent escape of any smaller animals
that may be placed in enclosure (capybara, etc.).
3.132EMPLOYEES.
A female employee that normally does not work with the animals (office staff) brought a family into the drive-thru
park with free-roaming exotic hoofstock because they were late and had missed the tour wagon. The employee and
the family left her car and walked to the tour wagon without any barriers between them and the animals. The family
boarded the wagon without incident however the employee was charged by a female wildebeest with a calf when
she tried to shoo it away from the wagon. This resulted in major injuries to the employee. This employee was not
sufficiently experienced or trained to be allowed into an enclosure with potentially dangerous exotic animals. Need
to ensure that all employees are sufficiently trained for any activities they do. Correct by November 6, 2014.
This was a focused inspection.
