2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* At least 7 dogs in the kennel had excessive hair matting. Several dogs had hair mats on the throat that were
ropy, twisted, and stained with saliva and debris. Multiple dogs had dense mats of hair on their sides and hind legs.
These mats were tight against the body and too dense to clearly visualize the underlying skin. Matted hair may
cause pain or discomfort. to the animals, and can lead to underlying skin irritation and infection. In addition, matted
coats do not provide complete protection against the elements.
The licensee must remove the matted hair from all affected dogs within 10 days of this inspection. As part of the
facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat maintenance to
ensure that animals are cleaned when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is removed on a regular
basis.
2.50(a) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* The owner identifies his dogs with microchips. When the owner was asked for the microchip identification
numbers of four adult dogs for a closer inspection of veterinary care, the owner stated, they are not chipped. There
was no other means of identification for these dogs. All regulated animals must be properly identified to ensure
proper tracking and maintenance.
2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Upon request, the records of the (cid:28)Dogs on Hand(cid:29) was not available. A record of the (cid:28)Dogs on Hand(cid:29) must be keptand maintained for all regulated animals. This will allow with certainty and track the movement of the 18 adult dogs
and two puppies held on the premises.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*Counting from the south of the North Kennel Building, enclosure two has chain link fence with metal pipe framing.
The bottom metal pipe for the framing is rusted through or broken. This broken pipe allows for a large enough gap
between the pipe and gate for the one dog housed in the enclosure to stick their muzzle or foot through. This can
result in possible injury.
Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept
in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. The metal pipe framing must be repaired or replaced
to prevent injury to the dogs and to maintain structural soundness of the enclosure fencing.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* In the North Kennel Building, seven wood dog boxes have a wood divider inside. These wood dividers have dog
doors that are excessively chewed and scratch along the edges. The South Kennel Building had three wood dog
boxes with doors that are excessively chewed and scratched along the edges. The North Kennel Building has five
support post and the South Kennel Building has four support posts that were excessively chewed and scratched.
These posts are located supporting the divider panels between the enclosures housing 12 adult dogs.
* There are at least two plastic water receptacles whose surfaces are excessively chewed along the top. The pitted
portion of chewed area had dirt or debris gray to brown in color.
These excessively chewed and scratched wood and plastic surfaces do not allow for proper cleaning and
sanitization. Therefore, increasing the disease potential for the animals. All wood and plastic surfaces must be
maintained on a regular basis or impervious to moisture. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization. With
proper cleaning and sanitization the disease potential for the animals is decrease.
3.1(c)(3) DIRECTHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* In the South building, the indoor shelter boxes have cattle panel roofs to contain the dogs. Throughout the
building, these panels are covered with a heavy accumulation of webbing, hair, dead insects and other debris.
Some enclosures also have a buildup of webbing, hair, and insects in the pen corners. The licensee places food
and water bowls directly under these contaminated roof panels. Several food/water receptacles within this building
contained dead insects, clumps of hair, and other debris. The food bowl in the enclosure housing two puppies had
a thick, ropy ring of hair and debris adhered to the interior wall of the bowl.
* In the North Kennel Building, several indoor shelters had an excessive accumulation of clumps of hair, cobwebs,
feces, and other waste. There was a buildup of brown grime or grease on the walls of at least five of these pens. In
the outdoor runs of the machine shed, two runs had a heavy accumulation of hair, waste, and debris along the
bottom of the chain link gates and adjoining panels.
The accumulation of waste material directly over food and water buckets poses a constant risk of contamination to
the enclosed animals. Both kennel buildings have a systemic, heavy buildup of grime and debris. The facility must
have a thorough cleaning, and must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination. Panels or roofs
directly over food and water buckets must be cleaned and kept clean to prevent contamination of feed and water.
This will decrease the hazards for 11 adult dogs and two puppies.
To be correct by, 27-October-2015.
3.2(c)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* Seven enclosures in the machine shed have no lighting (natural or artificial) for routine inspection, cleaning of the
facility and observation of the seven adult dogs. Inadequate cleaning, housekeeping practices and inspection of the
dogs can increase disease potential and prevent observation of the health for the dogs.
Additional lighting (natural and artificial) must be uniformly diffused throughout the animal facility. Sufficient lighting
will allow for good housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning and adequate inspection of the dogs. This will
decrease disease potential and allow for observation of the health for the dogs.
To be corrected by, 5-November-2015.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
* Nine feed receptacles used to feed nine adult dogs and two puppies had an excessive buildup of brown grime,dirt, debris, dog hair and bedding. This can increase the disease potential for the dogs.
All feed receptacles must be kept clean and must be sanitized frequently. Proper cleaning and frequent sanitization
will prevent an accumulation of grime, dirt, debris, dog hair and bedding in the feeders. This will decrease the
disease hazards for the dogs.
To be corrected by, 27-October-2015.
3.10
WATERING.
* 10 water receptacles used to water 10 adult dogs and two puppies had a buildup of gray to brown grime, dirt and
debris on the surfaces of the receptacles. This can increase the disease potential for the dogs.
Water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized in accordance to Section 3.11(b) to prevent an accumulation of
grime, dirt, debris, excreta and other disease hazards. Water receptacles that are kept clean and sanitized
properly can decrease the disease hazards for the dogs.
To be corrected by, 27-October-2015.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The North Kennel Building had an excessive accumulation of dust and cobwebs on the wood dog boxes. There is
an excessive accumulation of empty dog food bags and dust around the wood boxes.
* The South Kennel Building had an excessive accumulation of cobwebs and dirt onto of the wood dog boxes.
There was excessive dust and dirt on top the heat lamp guards that were hanging over the top of the dogs'
enclosures.
The accumulation of empty dog food bags, dust and dog hair can attract and provide breeding and living areas for
vermin, pests and other rodents. Thus, affecting the 18 adult dogs(cid:25) and two puppies health and well-being.
Premises must be kept free of trash, accumulations of dust, dog hair and cobwebs. This will facilitate cleaning of
the premises and pest control. Therefore, protecting the animals(cid:25) health and well-being. This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility owner, Dr. Mike Tygart (VMO) and Randall
Wagner (ACI).
This inspection will be sent by regular and certified mail.
