2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female white Shih Tzu (microchip #0A01321427) was cited under 2.40 (b)(2) on the previous inspection report
dated 12-December-2017. By 29-December-2017, the inspection reported required this dog to be evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian and an appropriate treatment plan developed and followed for the poor condition of her teeth.
At the time of this inspection (06-December-2018), the dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and
no treatment plan has been developed.
Re-inspection of this dog's teeth revealed that the entire surface of the upper and lower cheek teeth on the left side
of the mouth are coated in a brown-grey buildup of tartar. Nearly the entire surface of the upper left canine tooth is
also coated in brown-grey tartar. The entire surface of the upper right cheek teeth are covered in brown-grey tartar
and nearly the entire surface of the upper right canine tooth and front teeth are covered in a thick brown-black tartar.
The gums are slightly reddened.
This dog also has an abnormal appearance to the left eye. Near the center of the eye is a round red area and the
white of the eye is slightly reddened. The licensee stated the dog has had this eye condition since it was acquired,
but has not had it evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.
Male white Bichon (microchip #093276029) has a thick buildup of brown-black tarter on the entire surface of the
upper cheek teeth on the left and right side of the mouth. Nearly the entire surface of the upper right and left canine
teeth and front teeth are also coated in brown-black colored tartar. There is a line of grey material located at the
gum line of the upper left canine tooth. The gums are moderately reddened and appear to have receded away from
the teeth.
Male Yorkshire terrier (microchip #069053106) has a very thick buildup of brown-black tartar on the front teeth,
upper and lower cheek teeth and canine teeth on both sides of the mouth. The tartar buildup on the upper right side
of the mouth is so thick that the shape of the cheek teeth are difficult to identify. The gums are slightly reddened.
Poor dental health and abnormal conditions of the eye could cause pain and discomfort to the animal, as well as,
lead to further health issues. The above mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an
effective treatment plan for the condition of their teeth. Female Shih Tzu (#0A01321427) must also have the
abnormal condition of her left eye evaluated by a licensed veterinarian along with an effective treatment plan. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
At the time of the inspection, the licensee contacted a licensed veterinarian and obtained an appointment
(18-December-2018) for all three dogs.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
