2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee is identifying ill and injured animals and placing them in observation/treatment pens. Currently there are
two shelves containing guinea pigs with submandibular abscesses that are under observation. There is one shelf of
guinea pigs containing five animals that are undergoing treatments of various types, including systemic antibiotics
and topical application of wound dressing. Though the animals are being treated, documentation including when
treatments were started, what treatments are given, when treatments are done, and when treatments end are not
being recorded and maintained. Treatment records help assure animals are being treated appropriately for their
optimal health and well being. Licensee shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to
ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care by
maintaining accurate documentation of all veterinary care treatments and observations administered to the animals.
Documentation shall be maintained for examination by APHIS officials.
