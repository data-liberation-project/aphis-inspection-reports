2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
During inspection, two incidents of insufficient communication with the attending veterinarian regarding animals with
health problems were found:
• At Whitehall Forest Deer Facility, two deer with health issues were observed: A slightly underweight female deer (Y44)
with intermittent diarrhea ongoing for over a month and another female deer (Y25) with a deformity at her lower right jaw
that has previously led to swelling that was described as resulting from food impactions with occasional abscess
formation. Both deer had been medically treated over the past month, however, the attending veterinarian was not
consulted.
• In an incident occurring July 2-3, 2021, gerbils located at CAF were regrouped the afternoon of Friday, July 2 for
experimental purposes which led to fighting. This resulted in death of one gerbil and injuries in another, which was
discovered the morning of July 3. The injured gerbil was euthanized July 3, 2021 without consultation of the attending
veterinarian or designee. Communication with the attending veterinarian’s designee regarding this incident did not occur
until July 6, the first business day after the holiday weekend. The attending veterinarian was notified five days after the
fighting was discovered, on July 8, 2021.
Direct and frequent communication of problems to the attending veterinarian is critical to maintaining the health and


wellbeing of the animals and to address health issues in a timely and adequate manner. Medical care that is not being
directed by a veterinarian can result in inappropriate methods to diagnose and treat conditions.
The facility shall ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to the attending veterinarian is in place.

3.1(a) Critical

Housing facilities, general.
Until recently, one of the cat rooms in CAF had a buffer rail running approximately a couple of inches away from the wall
leaving behind a small gap. In May 2021, a young male neutered orange tabby cat, found by staff with his left rear leg
caught in that gap, sustained an injury requiring surgical repair. The secondary enclosure did not protect this cat from
injury. The facility must be structured in a manner to safely contain the animals involved. The buffer rail gap was
corrected at the time of the incident, prior to inspection.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
Two separate pasture enclosures of horses at Oconee County Farm were each observed to have a hole in a portion of
the fence line furthest from the barn.
The pasture to the left of the walkway, containing two mares and two foals, had an approximately 4 feet long by 2 to 3 feet
high hole in the fence located just below the top barbwire portion. Sharp points, along the edges of the broken wire, could
be seen pointing into the pasture, towards the side containing the horses.
The other affected pasture, to the right of the walkway, contained two yearlings and had a hole in the fence approximately
3 feet long by 2 feet high in size which was also located just below the top barbwire.
Failure to maintain enclosures in good repair could result in injury and/or escape.


All enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury or escape.
