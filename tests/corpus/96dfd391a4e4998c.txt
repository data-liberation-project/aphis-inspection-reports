Records: Operators of auction sales and brokers.
The majority of records of acquisition were missing some of the required information for the consignor. This included:
-Approximately 90% of the approximately 1000 records were missing the age or date of birth for the consigned animals
-Almost all of the approximately 1000 records were missing the color and/or distinctive markings for the consigned
animals.
-Approximately 50 records were missing the date of consignment.
-Approximately 100 records were missing the USDA License number (if licensed) or the vehicle license number and
driver’s license or state issued ID if the consignor is not licensed under the AWA.
-One record consigning a total of 24 animals (lots 6043-6066) was missing the address for the consignor

Many records were missing multiple pieces of required information. This included, but was not limited to:
-Lot number 2405, a female zebra which was missing the date of consignment, USDA license number or State Issued ID
and vehicle number.
-Lot numbers 2440 and 2441, 2 male wallabies which were missing the date of consignment, USDA license number or
State Issued ID and vehicle number.


-Lot numbers 2449 and 2450, 2 female dromedary camels which were missing the date of consignment, USDA license
number or State Issued ID and vehicle number.

Complete records are required by the Animal Welfare Act to allow tracebacks of medical and legal history of the animals
consigned. The auction shall make, keep, and maintain records/forms which fully and correctly disclose all the required
information of each animal consigned for auction or sold.

2.132(d) Critical

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
The auction knowingly accepted several animals for sale from unlicensed individuals which are required to be licensed,
but do not currently hold a valid license. This included:
-Four ringtail lemurs (lot #7565-7568) and 2 kinkajou (lot #7569-7570) were consigned from the same seller. The
consignment form did not contain a USDA license number. A valid license or one-time exemption is required to sell these
species and the consignor does not hold an active license and did not have a one-time exemption.
-Two capybaras (lot #3997-3998) were consigned by a seller. The consignment form did not contain a USDA license
number. A valid license or one-time exemption is required to sell these species and the consignor does not hold an active
license and did not have a one-time exemption.
-A porcupine (lot #8556) was consigned by a seller. The consignment form contained a USDA license number; however,
this license was not a valid license number. License numbers can be verified easily on the USDA, Animal Care Public
Search Tool. A valid license or one-time exemption is required to sell these species and the consignor does not hold an
active license and did not have a one-time exemption.


-One zebra (lot #2401) was consigned from a seller. The consignment form did not contain a USDA license number. A
valid license or one-time exemption is required to sell these species and the consignor does not hold an active license
and did not have a one-time exemption.
-One Patagonian cavy (lot #5594) was consigned from a seller. The consignment form did not contain a USDA license
number. A valid license or one-time exemption is required to sell these species and the consignor does not hold an active
license and did not have a one-time exemption.
-Five foxes (lot #7747-7749; 7751), 2 raccoons (lot #7753-7754) and 1 opossum (lot #7727) were consigned from the
same seller. The consignment form did not contain a USDA license number and this consignor was previously identified
to the licensee as not having a valid license. Sales of these animals that are not for fur, require a valid license.
-Two Coyote (lot #5572, 5579), three Opossum (lot# 5565, 5568-5569), and two raccoons (lot# 5566-5567) were
consigned from the same seller. The consignment form did not contain a USDA license number. A valid license is
required to sell these species and the consignor does not hold an active license. Sales of these animals that are not for
fur, require a valid license.

No dealer shall knowingly obtain any animal from any person who is required to be licensed but who does not hold a
current, valid, and unsuspended license. Verification of a current and valid license is important for ensuring compliance
with the Animal Welfare Act and ensuring animal welfare. Correct by ensuring that all consignors of covered species hold
a current valid unsuspended license before accepting consignment of those animals.
