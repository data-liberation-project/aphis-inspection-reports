*** There were expired medications found in the drug cabinet and refrigerator. One bottles of Clavamox with an
expiration date of 6/2015, injectable Oxytocin expired Oct/2015, injectable Xylazine expired 6/2014, injectable
Lidocaine expired 4/2010, and a bottle of Probiotics expired 9/2015. There was also multiple unlabeled bottles and
jars without a description of the name of the medication, dosage instruction and expiration dates. The drugs are
being stored in an area with other miscellaneous items and clutter, and there was a deep layer of dust build-up
observed. Use of expired medications is not considered proper veterinary care and can cause harm to the dogs. In
addition, all medications must be stored in an area which is kept clean and tidy.
***Two dogs, Dixie and BR, were observed with a moderate build-up of dental tartar. Dixie also was observed to
have a pea sized pink-red area on top of the right front paw. The dogs had not received veterinary treatment for
these conditions. Timely treatment of veterinary care issues is required in order to prevent unnecessary discomfort
and stress to the animals. Dental disease can cause pain and discomfort and can negatively affect the overall
health of the animal. Any dogs with health issues must be treated in a timely manner.

pest control program including bait stations and multiple traps, and is also in the process of renovating multiple walls
to add additional wall structures and glass board in an effort to prevent rodents from entering the building. Despite
these efforts there is, however, rodent droppings are still being identified. Pests can serve as a source ofcontamination and can cause the spread of disease. Additional efforts must be attempted in order to reduce
contamination by these pests in animal areas.
