2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:40 pm on
08-SEP-16.
Spoke to Mr. Fisher via telephone. He said the animals cited on the last inspection were examined by a
veterinarian, but does not have record of the evaluation. The animals are being treated and treatment records are
in the barn. Mrs. Fisher recently had a baby and is unable to accompany inspection today. Mr. Fisher will not
return until late afternoon. Without established optimal hours of inspection, Licensees must call with availability as
often as necessary to facilitate inspection.
