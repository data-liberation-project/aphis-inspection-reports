2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** Although some records of animals on hand are being kept in a computer data file the information is incomplete.
Records should also include: acquisition dates; the name and address of the person from whom the animals were
purchased or otherwise acquired; the USDA license or registration number of the person if he or she is licensed or
registered under the Act; or the vehicle license number and state, and the drivers license (or photographic state
identification card for nondrivers) if he or she is not licensed or registered under the Act.
The type of information cited above is important and applies particularly to the three reindeer most recently
acquired.
