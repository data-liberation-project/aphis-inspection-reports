2.40(b)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A current written program of veterinary care was not available for review. The facility does have an attending
veterinarian that makes regular visits to the facility. The facility must ensure a written program of veterinary care is
completed and maintained for review. This must include all regulated species housed at the facility, as well as
preventative care and emergency care for the animals.
***This issue has since been corrected
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
