ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:25 a.m. to
9:55 a.m. on 02/14/2014. Attempts to make contact with the licensee were done by ringing the doorbell and
knocking on the door, waiting in the driveway for 30 minutes, honking the vehicle horn, and calling on the phone and
leaving a message when there was no answer.
