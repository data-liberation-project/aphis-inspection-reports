ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog with USDA tag #016, was noticed to have an excessive amount of brown to black crust adhered to the hair
around both of her eyes. Upon further examination, the left eye had a milky white film covering the eye. In addition,
the eye appeared to be cone shaped coming outward and not rounded like a normal eye. Having eye issues can
cause the dog pain and discomfort if left untreated. Licensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian. Documentation of the examination, diagnosis and treatment must be maintained and made available
for inspection.
