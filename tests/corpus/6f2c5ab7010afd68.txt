HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The walk-in cooler contained an excessive amount of moldy produce (fruit) that may have been fed to regulated
animals. APHIS VMO noted several containers of moldy fruit on several shelves. Feeding moldy food to animals
posses a health risk and the nutritive value of that food is unknown. Food for regulated animals must be stored in a
manner that maintains its nutritive value and remains uncontaminated.
***The walk-in cooler contained open bags of primate feed that was not stored in containers with tightly fitting lids.
APHIS VMO noted one open bag of primate feeding sitting on a shelf in the walk-in cooler. Additionally, there were
several bags of open primate feed in a leak proof container, however, the container was full to the point the lid no
longer fit tightly. Storing feed in this manner does not prevent spoilage or contamination. Only the food and bedding
currently being used may be kept in animal areas, and when not in actual use, open food and bedding supplies
must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***An environmental enhancement plan to promote the psychological well-being of the nonhuman primates currently
housed at this facility is still incomplete. The plan, at a minimum, must address each of the following: social
grouping, environmental enrichment, special considerations, restraint devices and exemptions, when applicable.
Currently, the plan made available during inspection, only addresses environmental enrichment. The plan must be
completed, in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional
journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***The walk-in freezer was dirty. On the floor of the freezer was build up of debris and wrappers/empty bags.
Additionally, there was an excessive amount of what is presumed to be frozen blood on the freezer floor. Dirty andunkept freezers used for storing feed for regulated animals may contaminate the food and pose a health risk to the
animals if fed. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the
animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
To be corrected by 8/17/16.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
