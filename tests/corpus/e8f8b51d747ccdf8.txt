Watering.
Two ferrets are in an indoor enclosure. At initial observation, both ferrets were drinking eagerly at the water bottle, and
continued drinking for at least 10 minutes. The facility representative stated that they were given water in the morning and
she is not sure why there were drinking so much in that moment.

Water must be provided and be accessible as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal and to prevent
excessive thirst and dehydration. Correct by providing access to drinkable water more often. Corrected during the
inspection.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The floor of the front room to the left housing 1 opossum is cluttered with boxes, empty containers, and other items
stacked on and around the opossum enclosure. Around the animal enclosures throughout the premises, there is spilled
bedding and food. There is a torn bag of food along the wall at the entrance of the facility, and food is spilling out onto the
floor. Some areas of the floor have a buildup of dirt/grime.



Accumulations of dirt, trash, and other debris and clutter can be a disease hazard to animals, can create noxious odors,
and can be a breeding ground for vermin. Excessive clutter can hinder husbandry practices.

Trash should be placed in designated areas, the premises kept clean, and clutter minimized. Correct by March 1, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
