Section 2.38(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: Each research facility shall, during business
hours, allow APHIS officials: (1) To enter its place of business.
A facility representative was not available to allow access at 12:47 on 5/9/14.
When no one was present at the facility, the facility President was contacted by telephone and he indicated that he
would not be available that afternoon to come to the facility so that an inspection could be conducted and that there
is no backup person available this afternoon. This attempted inspection was conducted during the "most suitable
times for USDA/APHIS inspections" provided in writing by the facility President on 1-14-14.
