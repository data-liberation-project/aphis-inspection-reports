2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
DURING A FILMING OF AN EPISODE OF A TELEVISION SHOW AT THE LICENSEE'S FACILITY, A DRUGGED
GREVY ZEBRA IS GRABBED BY THE ACTOR AND PULLED TO THE GROUND. THE REGULATION CLEARLY
STATES THAT HANDLING OF ANIMALS MUST BE DONE IN A CAREFUL MANNER THAT DOES NOT CAUSE
TRAUMA, BEHAVIORAL STRESS, PHYSICAL HARM OR UNNECESSARY DISCOMFORT. ALLOWING AN
ANIMAL TO PHYSICALLY BE PULLED TO THE GROUND IN THIS MANNER COULD CAUSE ANY OR ALL OF
THE ABOVE. THE LICENSEE NEEDS TO TAKE ALL PRECAUTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT NONE OF HIS
ANIMALS ARE ALLOWED TO BE HANDLED IN THIS ROUGH MANNER AGAIN.
CORRECT BY: AT ONCE.
THIS FOCUSED INSPECTION AND EXIT BRIEFING WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE LICENSEE.
END OF REPORT.
