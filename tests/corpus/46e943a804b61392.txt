3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The current program of veterinary care does not include a sampling program with a schedule approved by the attending
veterinarian for fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworms. Lack a a sampling program makes it difficult to determine
the effectiveness of the treatment plan for parasites. A sampling and treatment program with a schedule approved by the
attending veterinarian must be established to help prevent and maintain an effective parasite program. Correct by May 1,

3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
There were no dates for the administration of distemper and parvovirus vaccines for the adult dogs. Licensee stated that a
5 way vaccine is given annually to the adult dogs. Failure to keep records on the dates and administration of distemper
and parvovirus vaccines to adult dogs makes it difficult to determine when vaccines and treatments were last given.
Licensee must keep and maintain records of the names and dates of all vaccines and treatments given to adult dogs.
