ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care remains incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of
veterinary care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written
PVC contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended
treatments consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of
administration, which are necessary when drugs are intended for use in species for which there are no
manufacturer label instructions, or which personnel have been trained in proper administration. Regarding
frequency of administration the written PVC says (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) for the majority of the species. There is no guidance
elsewhere clarifying what (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) means. A written program of veterinary care is required when attending
veterinarians are employed on a part time basis to ensure that the licensee and facility staff understand the direction
of the Attending Veterinarian and provide a mechanism by which APHIS Officials can determine their compliance
with those directions. Failure to include complete written guidance regarding these topics does not ensure good
welfare of the animals maintained by the facility as miscommunications may lead to failure to provide measures for
prevention, control, and treatment of disease. Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that
complete guidance regarding the dose, route, and frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species
that are not specifically labelled by the manufacturer are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care. At
a minimum guidance must include species-specific directions for vaccination, euthanasia, capture and restraint, and
the prevention, control, and treatment of internal and external parasites.

*** The current program of veterinary care still authorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for
(cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority
of species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai,Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. During this inspection, the Farm Manager was asked if the facility has acquired any
equipment for ventilating animals if needed. He stated that the facility will continue to follow the guidance contained
in the Program of Veterinary Care and no changes were planned, nor was any new or additional equipment
available.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,
or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis
of respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available
which are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.
Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or
neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of
general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care
as required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and
is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your
attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides
adequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of
administration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all
changes or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must
maintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The large heap of animal waste and bedding remains in the drive through area of the facility. Animals continue to
have access to this large pile and have been observed on previous inspections browsing and lying in the pile.
During today(cid:25)s inspection, no animals were observed in or on the pile, but additional spent bedding continues to be
added to the existing pile. Continued animal contact with this waste pile has been a concern on many previous
inspections (including 8/25/15, 4/20/15, 3/2/15, 11/12/14, 6/4/14, 2/19/14, 10/22/13, 6/12/13, 12/4/12, and 11/09/15)
as this unnecessarily exposes the animals to potential disease transmission. Correct this by removing this wastepile and dispose of all animal wastes properly.
