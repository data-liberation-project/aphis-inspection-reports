CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was a large number of flies in the non-human primate sheltered indoor housing area especially in the spider
monkey and marmoset enclosures. Flies were noted sitting and flying all over the shavings on the floor of the spider
monkey enclosure and the floor of the marmoset enclosure. The screen door to the indoor portion of the housing
was damaged leaving a large gap between the top of the door and the door frame allowing flies free access to the
building. Food debris present on the floor of the spider monkey enclosure appeared to be attracting the flies. No
evidence of any pest control program such as fly traps or fly strips were present. Flies can act as irritants to the
monkeys, keep them from accessing the indoor portion of their housing and can spread disease. The facility shall
develop and follow an effective program for the control of insect pests in the indoor portion of the monkey housing.

WATERING.
The only access to drinking water for the camels and zebra was a very small shallow muddy creek running through
their enclosure. There was no access to any water troughs or other potable water source. Access to potable water
is necessary to prevent dehydration and spread of disease/parasites. The camels and zebras shall be provided
potable water at all times or as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. Correct by July 3,
