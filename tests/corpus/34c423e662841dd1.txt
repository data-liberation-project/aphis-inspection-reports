2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were 5 of 6 puppy records that are missing puppy ID numbers for puppies that have been sold. The dates of
sale have not been recorded on the puppy records available. While the licensee is making out puppy records, the ID
numbers and dates sold are not being recorded on that record. Several of the records had the incorrect number of
puppies born listed, some recorded at 3 puppies actually had 6, which was found when looking at the 7006
Disposition records that were correct. While the 7006 records were complete, it was not possible to trace the
puppies on the actual puppy record with ID#s missing, or puppies missing on the actual record.
Complete and accurate records are important for proper animal management, accountability and traceability of all
animals at the facility.
The licensee must keep all puppy records completely, including their ID #, and dates of sale and/or death, and the
correct number of puppies per litter shall be noted. The number of puppies on the puppy record should be the same
number that are traceable to those sold, kept for stock or died.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee.
