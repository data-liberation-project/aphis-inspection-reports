FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the fox enclosure; on the southeast corner under the den structure, the foxes dug a hole and escaped the primary
enclosure. Both of the foxes have been safely captured.
The primary enclosure must be structurally sound to contain the animals, so the animals do not escape and become
injured, or deceased. All facility enclosures must be maintained in an appropriate state to contain the animals
securely and a system of maintenance must be implemented to ensure this does not reoccur.
