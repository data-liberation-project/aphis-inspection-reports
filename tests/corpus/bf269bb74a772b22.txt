3.1(a)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two outdoor enclosures that house two hybrid wolves that have multiple areas around the perimeter of the
fencing that has been dug out, exposing the 4x4 inch fencing. There are four (2 in each pen) areas approximately 3-
5ft long and 2-3ft wide with exposed fencing, with holes dug out beneath the 4x4 squares that are at least 1 ft deep.
As the regulated animals run around the perimeter of the fence they are continually having to jump over or
maneuver over the open holes of the fencing to avoid having a foot drop down through the fencing into a deep hole.
These holes present a health risk to the animals as long as the holes are not filled in. They risk stepping through
and getting a broken leg, or catching themselves on the corners of the fencing, or possibly digging under the fence
and exiting the enclosure.
All exposed fencing and holes in the ground around the perimeter of the enclosure should be filled in and covered
in a manner that protects the dogs from injury, and prevents them from digging out of the enclosure through
tunneling under the fencing.

3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is not an adequate shelter provided for the hybrid in Pen#3. While there is a corner wooden platform structure
for shade, there is not a shelter with a bottom, 4 sides and a top that would provide shelter from rain or bad weather
as required according to AWA regulations and standards.
The lack of appropriate shelter for the regulated animals can be a source of discomfort during times of cold, wet or
high wind conditions, which could lead to possible health issues.
The licensee must provide an appropriate shelter that includes a bottom, top and 4 sides that includes a way for theanimal to get away from the wind and weather at the doorway.
