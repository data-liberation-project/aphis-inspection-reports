2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is out-of-date. The veterinarian who signed the PVC in 2010 has
moved out of the area, and the provisions for annual preventive care described in the PVC are not being followed by
the exhibitor.
The exhibitor should work with an attending veterinarian to create a new written Program of Veterinary Care that
describes husbandry, preventive, and other care practices for the animals on hand, and this plan should include
provisions for regular veterinary care as needed, and a review of the written PVC by the exhibitor and attending
veterinarian at least once a year.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three llamas and 2 camels have overgrown hooves. An excessive hoof length can cause an animal to stand and
walk abnormally. Abnormal posture and gaits may cause strain on joints and may be accompanied by possible pain
and/or discomfort and joint damage. A system should be in place to identify animals that are in need of hoof
trimming and provide trimming in a timely manner.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a string of lights that runs along the inside tent above the animal enclosures. The light bulbs are not
covered and there are at least 4 light sockets that do not contain bulbs. In the event a bulb was to shatter, the
material would fall into the animal enclosures. Open light sockets may be harmful to animals.
To be corrected immediately
Two fencing panels, one between the camels and the zebras, and one between the zebras and a horse are in
disrepair. The one between the camels and the zebras has a top horizontal metal bar that has been bent
downwards. The camel can now reach his head and neck into the zebra enclosure. The other fence panel has an
area that is rusty and has broken apart. The current condition of these panels has the potential to result in injury to
the animals.
