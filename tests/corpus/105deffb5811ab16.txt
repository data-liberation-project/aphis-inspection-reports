2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The spotted rex rabbit "Bugs" had dry, slightly swollen, hairless, reddened areas covering about 40% of the bottom
of her back feet. She also has hardened, slightly crusted, blackish areas (about 0.5 x 0.5 cm scab-like) on the
bottom of her back heels and knuckles. It was observed that "Bugs" seems to prefer sitting on the board within her
enclosure or the mound in front of her food receptacle but she will voluntarily hop on the wire occasionally. Her fur is
also slightly crusty and brownish along her back end. The owner reports that "Bugs" has had on and off foot
problems over the last several months that usually improve with nursing care. She had last been checked for foot
problems a week ago when they had appeared resolved.
It is important that animals with chronic conditions be examined by a veterinarian for their disease, even if past
episodes have been resolved with nursing care. For example, animals may have underlying conditions which might
make them more susceptible to chronic illness or require a change in husbandry. A veterinarian can provide
services and guidance for appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat these conditions.
Correct by 8/2/14.
3.54(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
There was a moderate to large amount of caked food on the bottom of the food receptacle in one of the rabbit
enclosures. A small amount of rabbit feces was also observed in the food receptacle. Contaminated feed in an
animal's food bin may be unpalatable to the animal (the animal might not want to eat it) and/or it may harbor
pathogens or toxins which can harm the animals. Food receptacles shall be located to minimize contamination by
excreta, kept clean, and measures must be taken to prevent molding, deterioration, or caking of the feed.
3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was an approximately 2-3 x 4 inch mound of dried fecal material and food pellets in the four wire-bottom
primary enclosures occupied by rabbits. In two of the cages the mound was located in front of the feeder and therabbits would only be able to access the food by walking on the mound. Failure to provide adequate cleaning may
lead to buildup of pathogens in the feces and food which may cause illness in the animals. It can also attract pests
that can cause discomfort to the rabbits or spread disease. Primary enclosures shall be kept reasonably free of
excreta, hair, and cobwebs by periodic cleaning.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
In the pen that held the llamas there were several long strands of baling twine on the ground, partially embedded in
the soil, from a hay bale that had been recently moved. There were also several areas in this pen where there were
small accumulations of broken porcelain and glass. Most of this was discarded immediately.
In the pen that held the young goats there was a section of spare wire fencing on the ground with some exposed
edges facing upwards.
Sections of twine can injure the animals if they ingest the twine or become tangled in it. Animals may be cut by
pieces of glass or exposed wire edges. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and removed
from animal pens as necessary.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Owner.
