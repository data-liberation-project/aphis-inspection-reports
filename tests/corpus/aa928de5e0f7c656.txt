2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
A USDA APHIS Official conducted a search at Jayell Ranch on 08/18/22. The Owner of the property was not present but
the attendant was able to contact the owner by phone and arrangements were made for staff to accompany USDA Official
to the capuchins' enclosure. The USDA Official observed a Capuchin being exhibited during this time. USDA discussed
the reason for visit and basic USDA requirements with the attendant on site, and later with the owner by phone. USDA
then provided information regarding licensing requirements and procedures, as well as the website address where they
can obtain more information on requirements as well as how to access the online application portal to submit an
application.
The facility is currently conducting regulated activity by exhibiting the capuchin without a license.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative on site and the exit briefing conducted with
the owner by phone.
