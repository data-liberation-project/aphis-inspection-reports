3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Two outdoor enclosures each housing 4 adult dogs has an excess amount of excreta covering the ground. The
enclosure next to the house the excreta is covering the majority of the enclosure along the front where the animals
have to walk in it to get into the shelter or towards the front of the enclosure. Accumulation of excreta can soil the
dogs, increase disease transmission, odors and attract flies, and other pests.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures on a daily basis or more often to prevent the
soiling of the dogs and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odor.
