2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Chinchillas E1-2077, H1-1655, C1-445, and K1-740 have a milky white discharge coming from both eyes that have
caused the eyes to become partially or totally matted shut. The eye issues with discharge and matting can cause
pain and suffering. The chinchillas were quiet and withdrawn to the back of their enclosures to avoid light.
Chinchilla E1-1201 had an overgrown left bottom incisor causing the incisor to protrude out of the mouth
approximately 1/2 inch interfering with chewing and eating.
All of the health issues identified above are impacting animal health and well being. Daily observation of these
animals is not effective. Thus, health issues are not identified within a timely manner and communicated to the
attending veterinarian. It is the licensees responsibility to see that daily observations are completed appropriately
and effectively. Additionally, there must be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending
veterinarian to ensure all health issues are addressed within a timely manner, to include the animals identified
above.
