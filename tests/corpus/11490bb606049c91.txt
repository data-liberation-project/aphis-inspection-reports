3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
An opened bag of bedding was stored on the floor of the kennel, and a large supply of unopened bags of bedding was
being kept on the floor within a separate building. The keeping of open bedding, and supplies of unopened bedding, on
the floor does not allow for cleaning underneath and around the supplies, and is not protective of the supplies from
spoilage, contamination, and pests. Opened supplies of bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting
lids, and supplies of bedding must be stored off of the floor and away from the walls.
