ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Blue roan cocker dog, Zoey, identification number 12 has mats hanging from the bottom of each ear and mats
hanging between the dogs front legs.
Matted hair on the dog can cause discomfort & could lead to infection or health problems for that dog. Mobility of
the dog could also be affected with the discomfort or pain associated with matted hair constantly pulling on the skin
of the dog. The potential for the skin to become inflamed or infected is a big possibility. Matted hair does not
maintain the same insulating qualities of normally groomed hair. Regular grooming of matted hair is necessary to
ensure the health & well-being of all dogs. The owner must groom this dog in a way that removes these mats/balls
of hair. Correct by 12-08-2014.
