ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1630 on
30-Aug-18.
I arrived at the facility at 1600. There was a locked gate across the driveway. I tried calling the primary number and
there was no answer and no ability to leave a message. I waited for 30 minutes and tried calling the primary number
again at 1630 with no answer. I reviewed the file again and found a second number. I called that number and left a
message. At 1645, the facility owner returned my call and stated that he would not be able to meet me for
inspection on that day and no other authorized person was available.
