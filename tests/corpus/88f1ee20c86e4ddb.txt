2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
No readily identifiable attendant was present during periods of public contact at the petting zoo. For long periods of time
there was no attendant monitoring interactions between the public and the animals. According to the facility they have
attendants out consistently during busier times but in the cold weather when less people are visiting the attendants are
occasionally performing other duties. Without an attendant, the animals may be subjected to unnecessary physical or
behavioral stress. Correct by 12/23/21 by ensuring that an easily identifiable attendant is always present during times of
public contact for the safety of the animals and the public.
3.56(b)(1)

Sanitation.
The rabbit enclosures are not being sanitized every 30 days. According to the facility the rabbit enclosures are cleaned
out weekly using an apple cider vinegar mixture. They are also pressure-washed approximately twice a year. However,
they are not being consistently sanitized every 30 days. Proper sanitization of enclosures is important to minimize disease
risks and hazards to the animals. Correct by 12/27/21 by ensuring that all rabbit enclosures are sanitized in accordance
with 3.56(b)(3) at least once every 30 days.
3.125(a)



Facilities, general.
The enclosures housing the goats, sheep, alpacas, llama, and rabbits have areas that are not being maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury. On the fence line between the cattle enclosure and the enclosure housing some
goats, sheep, alpacas, and a llama there are several areas of sharp fence wires where the fencing has been cut. Some of
these wires have been bent and created gaps about 4" x 6" which could entrap an animal's leg or hoof. In the goat
enclosure there are some sharp nail tips that extend through the side of the run-in shelter and into where the animals
have access. There is also metal mesh wrapped around the trunk of a tree that has been torn and twisted, leaving sharp
edges. In one rabbit enclosure there is the tip of a screw exposed through the flooring near a back access door. Sharp
points in shelters and along fencing housing animals can allow animals to injure themselves. Additionally, gaps in fencing
that can allow a leg or limb through can lead to an animal becoming trapped or injured. Correct by 1/15/21 by ensuring
that the housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
