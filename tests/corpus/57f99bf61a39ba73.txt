Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
According to the licensee, no 7005 form was being maintained for the two adult dogs being housed at the facility.
Likewise, according to the licensee, some of the 7006 forms reflective of some of the recent puppy sales were missing.
Other 7006 disposition forms were available, but were missing some of the required information.

The lack of records does not allow for accurate tracing of animals. Accurate animal records regarding disposition are used
to help evaluate the facility's animal care program and for animal tracking for ownership and health care concerns.

Each dealer shall use Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) and Record of Disposition
of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) to make, keep, and maintain required information concerning each dog.

Housing facilities, general.


A bag of bedding at the premises was being kept on the floor, and a container of a cleaning substance was being kept
without a lid next to the enclosure of one of the dogs.

Supplies of bedding kept on the floor can be spoiled, contaminated, and/or infested with vermin, creating potentially
hazardous situations for dogs. Additionally, cleaning substances may be toxic and hazardous to dogs, especially if the
product spills into the enclosure from being unlidded and in close proximity to dogs.

Supplies of bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation. Supplies of bedding must be stored off the floor to allow for cleaning underneath and around the supplies.
Substances that are toxic but required for normal husbandry practices must not be stored in food storage and preparation
areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the animal areas.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
During the inspection, various accumulations of clutter were observed throughout the animal facility where two dogs were
being kept. There were empty food bags on and near the ground, dusty and dirty floors throughout the facility, and animal
enclosures containing debris and dusty equipment.

Buildings that are not kept clean can serve as breeding grounds for pests and vermin, and can expose the dogs to
contagious diseases.



Premises where housing facilities are located must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals. Premises
must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products, and discarded matter.

Veterinary care for dogs.
According to the licensee, no program of veterinary care was developed, documented in writing, and signed by a current
Attending Veterinarian that guides the licensee on required components of adequate veterinary care. The licensee
described the presence of fleas at the facility, which were also observed in the environment by USDA. However, although
the licensee described steps being taken to limit the flea infestation, there was no program of veterinary care by an
Attending Veterinarian for the licensee to follow.

A Program of Veterinary Care must be developed, documented, signed by the Attending Veterinarian with whom the
licensee has formal arrangements, and the Program must be followed. Running a commercial dog operation without
providing care per an Attending Veterinarian can create unhealthy environments, including creation of the potential for
increased susceptibility to contagious diseases of dogs and other conditions that can negatively affect canine health,
including from parasitism and pests.

The licensee must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by an Attending Veterinarian with whom the licensee procures formal arrangements.
