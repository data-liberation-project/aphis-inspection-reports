WATERING.
Section 3.30 Watering: There were accumulations of moist dirt and debris by the automatic water valves for 3 racks
of enclosures housing 242 guinea pigs. The moist dirt and debris may harbor disease hazards such as bacteria,
fungi, and parasites. Once APHIS officials identified the effected enclosures/rack, employees cleaned the area
around the automatic water valves, water lines and back of the racks. The licensee must ensure that the areas
around the water valves are sanitized when dirty for the health of the guinea pigs. Correct from this day forward.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: The racks housing the guinea pig enclosures had dirt, debris and cobwebs on the
support frames, top, and shelves. The underside of the top of one rack had a large accumulation of brown matter
adhered to the surface above an enclosure housing 10 guinea pigs. Animal enclosures on dirty racks exposes
animals to potential health hazards such as fungal, bacterial and viral diseases. The licensee must ensure animal
racks are kept clean to maintain the health of the animals.
Note: There were no animals found in need of veterinary care during this inspection. The ventilation system was
running on the racks housing the Chinese hamsters. The food for the hamsters was dry and free of mold. The
hamsters had clean dry bedding in their enclosures.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility president; Mary Geib, VMO; and Robert Markmann, ACI.
