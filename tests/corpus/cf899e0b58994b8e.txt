A three-year-old tan female Pekinese (956000009912719) has an abnormal condition of the left eye. The eye appears
reddened and shrunken into the eye socket. The dog also has a thick buildup of brown tartar covering the entire surface
of the upper and lower cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth. The gums are slightly reddened.

The licensee stated she had previously applied antibiotics to the dogs eyes, but had run out. She also stated the three
Pekinese haven't seen her attending veterinarian for their eye issues.


Failure to ensure that health problems are identified on a daily basis and failure to communicate these issues with a
veterinarian in a timely manner may result in unnecessary suffering of an animal. The licensee must ensure that all health
issues are identified on a daily basis and these issues are communicated to a veterinarian in a timely manner.

Indoor housing facilities.
Ten adult female dogs and 42 puppies are house in a completely enclosed building with an air conditioning unit. The
animals’ enclosures are made of metal and unsealed wood. Some of the litter pans under the dog’s cages had dirty
bedding. The combination of the dirty bedding and the unsealed wood contained a powerful smell of ammonia which
caused the inspectors sinuses, throat, and chest to burn. Inadequate ventilation can lead to eye issues and other medical
problems in dogs. Indoor facilities for dogs must be sufficiently ventilated to minimize ammonia and other strong odors.
