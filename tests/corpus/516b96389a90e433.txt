3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the outdoor facility portion of the main building, there are 4 enclosures housing nine adult dogs that had a build of
dirt and debris on the interior walls, dog houses, and the interior portion of the wind/rain break.
The build-up of dirt, feces, and debris can harbor diseases. The licensee must spot-clean all used primary
enclosures, and food and water bowls daily and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and ACI Bartels.
