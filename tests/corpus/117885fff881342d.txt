Facilities, general.
The facility has several areas in disrepair.
--In the pig and goat enclosure there is a concrete footer surrounding the barn which has cracked and lost large areas of
concrete. This has created a ledge with a 3-4 inch drop down onto dirt. Uneven flooring surfaces can lead to animal
injuries, especially in breeds such as Tennessee Fainting Goats.
--In the indoor holding of the black bear enclosure there are several areas of concrete with paint flaking off the surface.
Directly adjacent to the primary shift door to the outside, there is a large area of about 4-5 inches that is actively peeling
paint with pieces hanging off the wall. There are a few other affected areas throughout indoor holding, primarily around
the shift doors and at the level of some furniture structures.
-- The outdoor portion of the racoon enclosure has areas of overlying concrete flaking off by the shift door. Directly to the
bottom right of the shift door, pieces of concrete about 1-2" in size were easily broken off when touched by the inspector.
--The roof of the indoor raccoon enclosure is partially accessible from the outside enclosure and has several roof tiles that
are damaged. The tiles have uneven edges and appear to have lost parts of the top layer.
-- The ceiling in the otter enclosure has a single panel that has become unattached at the bottom right corner.
Facilities that are in disrepair with flaking paint, concrete, or damaged surfaces can pose an ingestion hazard to the


animals as well as cause potential injury or other illnesses.
Correct by November 25, 2022 by ensuring all housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
