2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several animals were observed with eye abnormalities and skin lesions (described in detail below). The attending
veterinarian had not been contacted prior to the inspection regarding any of these animals and none were receiving
any veterinary treatment at the time of inspection.
** Direct ** A female grey guinea pig in pen 45 appeared to be lethargic and systemically ill. The animal was found
lying on its stomach in the pen. The guinea pig did not move when the licensee(cid:25)s wife picked up the animal. On
closer examination, there was greyish mucus discharge around the outside of the left eye. The right eye appeared
normal and fully opened. The guinea pig felt warm to the touch and was not responsive. In the 2 hour time period
from the discovery of the guinea pig(cid:25)s illness (during inspection) to the arrival of the veterinarian the animal died.
** Direct ** A female black and white guinea pig in pen 32 had its left eye completely closed. On closer examination,
the left eye appeared sealed shut by a greenish to grey crusty discharge. The left eye lids also appeared swollen.
The right eye appeared normal and fully opened. At time of inspection, a veterinarian was contacted and examined
the animal. The AV diagnosed this as a ruptured cornea.
** Direct ** A male black and white guinea pig in pen 8 had its right eye partially closed. On closer examination, the
bottom lid had a white mucus discharge. The left eye appeared normal and fully opened.
A female black and white guinea pig in pen 29 had skin lesions around the right eye and on top of the nose. The
skin next to the upper corner of the eye lid had no hair and appeared dark, thickened, and flaky. There were dark
red to black crusty areas centrally which appeared consistent with scabs / dried blood and small amounts of fresh
blood were present as well. The skin lesion on the top of the nose had a cluster of small red to black color scabs
(consistent with dried blood) and a moderate amount of hair loss in the area.
A male tri-color guinea pig in pen 4 had skin lesions on the left hip. On closer examination, there appeared a cluster
of small red to black color scabs (consistent with dried blood) and a moderate amount of hair loss in the area. The
affected area was an approximately 1 inch by 1 inch. A female white guinea pig in pen 45 had skin lesions around the right eye. The skin at the lower corner of the right
eye was dry and flaky with hair loss. There were also a few small red scab-like lesions in the affected area.
A female tri-color guinea pig in pen 48 had skin lesions on top of the nose. The skin lesion on top of the nose had a
cluster of small red color scabs with a moderate amount of hair loss in a 1 inch by 1 inch area. Additionally, the skin
appeared dry and flaky.
A female brown and white guinea pig in pen 50 had skin lesions around the left eye. On closer examination, the skin
at the lower corner of the left eye was dry and flaky with hair loss. There were also multiple small red and brown
scab-like lesions in the affected area.
A female black and white guinea pig in pen 4 had a white cloudy appearance to its left eye. On closer examination,
the black color often seen in guinea pig irises was barely visible and the guinea pig appeared blind in that eye.
Opaque white flakes were seen in the center of the cornea. The right eye appeared normal and fully opened.
A female brown and white guinea pig in pen 29 had skin lesions around the right eye and on top of the nose. The
skin under the left lower eye lid was dry and flaky with hair loss. The underlying skin did not appear inflamed and
the guinea pig was not observed scratching at the affected area.
The eye is a sensitive organ of the body and failure to appropriately treat an eye illness not only results in pain for
the animal but can also lead to secondary infections and blindness. Ruptured corneas may result from severe injury
(such as a traumatic puncture) or when minor injuries or eye infections are left untreated. Eye abnormalities can
also be a sign of systemic diseases that left untreated can cause further illness or death in an animal. It is vital that
these animals be examined and treated by a veterinarian as soon as possible and that all future medical
abnormalities involving the eyes must be referred to the attending veterinarian as soon as they are observed.
Guinea pigs have relatively sensitive skin and are prone to skin problems especially during periods of stress such
as pregnancy. Skin injuries or infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including fungal, bacterial, parasitic
infections, hormonal abnormalities, and various metabolic conditions. If left untreated even minor problems may
lead to secondary infections which negatively impacts animal welfare or in some cases may even result in death.
Additionally, depending on the cause these conditions may be intensely itchy resulting in discomfort and
self-trauma. When infectious, skin disorders are often readily transmitted to other uninfected animals in the same
enclosure or enclosures nearby. Some of these infectious skin disorders can even be transmitted to people. All
animals exhibiting these skin abnormalities must be examined by a veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic
testing can be completed and a proper diagnosis can be made. Additionally, the licensee must follow all
recommendations made by the attending veterinarian including those regarding testing, isolation of affected
animals, and treatment.
Regardless of presenting clinical signs, all animals must be provided appropriate methods to prevent, control,diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in a timely manner. A veterinarian was contacted and the animals listed
above were examined during the inspection. Initial treatments were administered at the time of inspection and the
licensee was continuing to follow these recommendations at the time of the exit interview. Records of continued
care provided must be maintained by the licensee and be made available to APHIS Officials upon request.
2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A total of 10 guinea pigs were found to be in need of veterinary care (cited above). In all 10 cases no treatment was
performed and the licensee(cid:25)s wife, a primary caretaker, was unaware of the medical abnormalities of these 10
guinea pigs. Both the skin and eye lesions listed above are conditions which take time to develop to the severity
exhibited in these animals; however, the lesions were not observed or reported to a veterinarian by animal
caretakers prior to inspection. Daily observation to assess all animals(cid:25) health and well-being along with a direct and
frequent mechanism of communication to a veterinarian is necessary to ensure all animals are treated
appropriately. Correct by ensuring all animals are properly observed daily and all abnormalities are communicated
to a veterinarian in a timely manner.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There was no inventory of animals on hand available and the total number of animal owned was unknown at the
time of inspection. The licensee currently tracks animals by totaling sales on a calendar and maintaining sales
receipts. There were no records of any births (other than these sales figures) and no records of any deaths (either
natural or by euthanasia) occurring in the last year. Accurate records of all acquisitions (including births) and
dispositions (including deaths) are necessary to evaluate trends and monitor the health of the colony. Correct by
developing and maintaining a current inventory of all animals.
3.26(c)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The indoor housing facility for the guinea pigs does not provide adequate lighting. During the inspection a flashlight
had to be used to adequately inspect the facility and the health of the guinea pigs. The natural light provided by the
windows did not adequately illuminate the bottom guinea pig pens. The inspection was in the early afternoon on a
clear sunny day. There was one large propane gas light in the facility but it was not on. The wife of the licensee
remarked that using a flashlight would definitely help better assess the guinea pigs(cid:25) health because you could see
them better. Proper lighting is essential in the health and well-being of guinea pigs. You cannot perform adequate
cleaning of the facility nor can you properly assess the health of the guinea pigs without suitable lighting. Correct by
providing proper lighting that uniformly illuminates all enclosures that allows for appropriate cleaning and accurateinspections to take place.

3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
The primary enclosures for the guinea pigs are not currently being adequately cleaned and sanitized. There is a
brown greasy film on the inside of the enclosure approximately 3 inches wide from the bottom of the enclosure that
spans the entire length of 10 guinea pig enclosures. According to the wife of the licensee, only bleach is being used
to clean the inside of the enclosures every 7 days along with changing the bedding. Although the licensee is
cleaning the enclosures every 7 days, it is clear from the residues that remain, that the current cleaning efforts have
been ineffective. No detergent is currently being used. Bleach and other disinfectants are inactivated by organic
matter, so that means bleach and other disinfectants won(cid:25)t work well unless there is a detergent that breaks up the
biological waste produced by the guinea pigs. The accumulated brown build-up can function as a suitable
environment for bacteria to grow and can serve as a source of infection for the guinea pigs in the enclosures.
Correct by ensuring that all guinea pig enclosures are properly cleaned and sanitized through an appropriate
method such as washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by application of a safe and effective
disinfectant or use another method described in 3.31(a)(4).

The inspection was conducted with the wife of the licensee on 10/8/2014. An exit interview was conducted at that
time and all non-compliant items were explained. The need for veterinary care for the guinea pigs cited during the
inspection and APHIS expectations for veterinary documentation were explained at that time. A formal exit
interview was conducted with the wife of the licensee on 10/10/2014.
