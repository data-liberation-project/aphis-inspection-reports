ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
**** There was not an environmental enhancement plan (EEP) on hand to adequately address the psychological
well-being of the nonhuman primates. The EEP must be reviewed and approved by the attending veterinarian.
There are many sources that can assist in developing a plan for nonhuman primate enrichment. (cid:28)The Psychological
Well-Being of Nonhuman Primates(cid:29) published by the National Research Council is one source. There is no plan
denoting the enrichment and no log book or calendar showing that enrichment takes place. The animals do have
different items in their enclosures, but there is no schedule of rotating or changing the items in the pens. The
enrichment must be documented on the environmental enhancement plan, and the plan must be followed.
