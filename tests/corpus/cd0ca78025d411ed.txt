2.126(a)(1)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(a) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 11:35 AM on 11/24/2014.
The facility refused to allow APHIS inspectors to conduct the Animal Welfare Inspection. Refusal to allow inspection
is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
The licensee arrived, but stated she did not have time to assist me with an inspection. She said she was leaving,
and that the enclosures had not yet been cleaned, but that her adult daughter was coming to do that for her. I asked
if she could show me her paperwork, and then her daughter could show me the facility, but she said her daughter
would not be comfortable doing that. I informed her that this would be considered a refusal to allow inspection.
