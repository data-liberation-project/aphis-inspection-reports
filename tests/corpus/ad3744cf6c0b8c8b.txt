a new system using colored dots for monitoring for expiration dates on medications but a vial of an analgesic
medication was found in the front of the cabinet labeled with the proper color and month for expiration of 6-15 but
this had not been removed from the current stock of medications or labeled in any way to prevent its use.
The following expired medications were noted:
-Lidocaine hydrochloride injectable expired 6-15
**Expired medications/vaccinations should not be used in the treatment of the regulated animals. Expired
medications should be either clearly labeled as expired or disposed of in a proper manner.

and/or injuries are in accordance with established standard veterinary practices and the regulatory requirements of
the Animal Welfare Act.
