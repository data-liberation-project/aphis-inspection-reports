3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
An effective program that controls insects, external parasites, and rodents must be in place to maintain the good
health and well-being of animals. The Grooming room, which contains clean towels, the refrigerate(Used for
dog meds), and other items used for dog husbandries, needs to have the mice feces cleaned up. The breeder must
put into place a good program that can eliminate mice and mice feces in these areas. Along with a good rodent
program is the elimination of any items not needed or used in a timely fashion. These areas, along with cabinets,
shelves, and grooming tools must be kept clean to order to help maintain an infection and disease free area for
dogs.
The breeder must clean and maintain a good husbandry process in areas that can affect the health of dogs.
