3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the coatimundi enclosure, there is a high wooden platform where the animals climb to access their automatic
water dispenser. This platform is wobbly and not fully secured to its base. This could cause unnecessary harm or
injury to the animals housed therein. The platform must be adequately secured to maintain structural strength and to
prevent injury to the animals. It is the facility's responsibility to ensure that the animals have safe and sturdy
climbing structures within their primary enclosure.
