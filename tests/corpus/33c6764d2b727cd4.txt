FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is a strong odor of ammonia in the dwarf hamster room and in the infirmary/holding room housing hamsters
at the time of the inspection. The odor was strong enough to cause my eyes and nose to burn upon entry into these
rooms. Strong ammonia odors may also be expected to cause irritation and discomfort to the animals housed in
these rooms. Enclosures in these rooms appeared to be clean so it is likely the ammonia odor is accumulating due
to inadequate ventilation. Ventilation must be increased to reduce odors to provide for the health and comfort of the
animals. CORRECT BY : 7-3-17

SANITATION.
Cobwebs are present on walls, ceilings and light fixtures in all the animal rooms this date. There is an accumulation
of dust on storage shelves and animal cage racks. There are discarded items and empty water bottles on shelves
next to animal enclosures in all rooms. Discarded items may become a breeding area for pests and a buildup of
cobwebs and dust does not provide a healthy environment for the animals. All animal rooms must be kept clean and
free of clutter to maintain husbandry practices . CORRECT BY : 7-26-17
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
Mouse and rat droppings are present on shelves and and other surfaces in all the animal rooms this date. Wild
rodents harbor diseases that may harm and kill domestic rodents. Licensee stated rat/mouse bait is used on the
roof of the animal rooms. Pest control must be increased and a control program maintained to maintain a healthy
environment for the animals and to reduce the chance of disease transmission.
