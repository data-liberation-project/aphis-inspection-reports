3.101(a)(3)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Pool "DB" located in the North Support area has 2 areas of cracking walls in the area adjacent to the old nursery
pool. These cracks are wide & large enough to allow water, dirt & debris to get into them and this would not
facilitate the cleaning and sanitation of the pools. Additionally, due to the concrete compromised strength in these
areas, pieces of concrete & or paint may potentially fall off and enter the pool itself.
All pool surfaces must be maintained in good repair.
