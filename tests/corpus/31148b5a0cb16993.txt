ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The alpaca has all four overgrown hooves. The facility representative stated that a farrier has been contacted but to
date no formal appointment has been arranged for the farrier to trim the alpaca's hooves. Overgrown hooves can
be painful and can lead to other health problems if not addressed in a timely manner. The licensee must provide
proper hoof care to the alpaca. Correct by June 30, 2015.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
End of report.
