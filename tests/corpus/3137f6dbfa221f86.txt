Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage and
contamination. Food requiring refrigeration must be stored accordingly, and all food must be stored in a manner
that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. The light fixture in the food cooler was leaking

store the food. This leak and the light fixture need to be addressed to protect the feed and to maintain the light in
order for the cooler to be properly inspected.
