2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee was not able to locate the inventory records for the pigs, alpacas, llama, and bison. Not being able to
provide the inspector with a complete record of the animal inventory doesn't allow for proper tracking of the animals
by an APHIS official. The licensee must either locate the current inventory or create a new inventory properly
documenting all the regulated animals that are on site. Correct by 2/20/19.
3.127
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The bison do not have access to adequate natural or artificial shelter. The lack of shelter for the bison has been
discussed during previous inspections. The facility has been working on getting shelter for some time, but to date
still do not have shelter for the bison. Lack of shelter does not protect the bison from the elements of the weather
such as sun, rain, wind, and snow. Natural or artificial shelter must be provided to protect the bison from inclement
weather. Correct by 11/6/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
