Premise.
***The outdoor facility had a pile of tires, rolled up fencing and other fencing supplies adjoining the enclosures with
tall weeds (approximately 2-4 feet tall) growing among them. The food and bedding storage area for the outdoor
facility had old open dog food (not used for kennels dogs) discarded feed bags and other clutter. The sheltered
building floor had food and hair in the walkways. Waste, old food, weeds, and clutter can harbor insects, pests, and
vermin. The insects, pests and vermin can bite and irritate the dogs, contaminate the environment, food and water,
and increase the risk of potential disease to the dogs. The licensee must remove the waste, clutter and weeds and
maintain them to prevent or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin.
