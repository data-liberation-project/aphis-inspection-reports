ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male pygmy goat "Jake" was observed limping on his left front leg. Although the animal would use the leg when
moving, the goat would lift the left front leg when standing.
The licensee had been monitoring the lameness; however, the condition had not improved. The licensee stated he
would contact the attending veterinarian. Timely diagnosis and treatment for an injury or illness may prevent undue
pain and a worsening of the condition.
The animal was examined by the attending veterinarian on December 26, 2019.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
