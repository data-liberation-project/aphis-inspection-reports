2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***There was a spotted Ossabaw pig (#160-5), approximately five months old, which had lost four pounds in one
week. The animal was weighed by the caretaker on 8/12/14 with a recorded weight of 29 pounds and on 8/19/14
the animal(cid:25)'s weight was recorded at 25 pounds. The animal had a large amount of food present in its bowl, while
the other three pigs at the facility had empty food receptacles. According to the caretaker the animals were all
weighed weekly and were each maintaining weight or gaining weight. This amount of weight loss in a growing
animal could indicate an illness, infection or other veterinary medical condition. The registrant must have this
animal examined by a veterinarian in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and ensure that an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. The registrant must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary
care at all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: August 23, 2014.
The exit interview was conducted on August 21, 2014 with facility representatives.
