ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Access to records.
The facility's written Program of Veterinary Care was not available for review. This does not allow the inspector to
determine if the plan is current, reflects the care being provided to the animals and is appropriate for the species of
animals. The written Program of Veterinary Care must be made available for review upon further requests during
inspection. Correct by June 7, 2017.
This inspection was conducted with a city employee and the exit interview was conducted with the Park
Superintendent.
