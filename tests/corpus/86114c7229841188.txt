2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee could not demonstrate during the inspection that any of the big cats or the fox were vaccinated as
indicated on the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). A telephone call to the consulting veterinarian's office
confirmed that the cougars were vaccinated against Rabies and are current on that vaccination, but has not
received the recommended Distemper vaccinations as indicated on the PVC.
The veterinarian's office staff also indicated that the tigers, leopards, & fox were not vaccinated against Rabies &
Distemper as also indicated on the PVC.
These vaccinations prevent disease and should be administered as recommended by your veterinarian, and the
lack of vaccinations is not an appropriate method to prevent diseases and the spread of those diseases.

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Currently, the licensee is offering a select number of the public to come up to the enclosure to directly feed tigers by
hand through a small opening that was created in the chain link fence without the use of tongs, forceps, or other
implements.This method of allowing the public to feed large & potentially dangerous felids does not assure the safety of the
public as well as the cats being fed.
If public feeding is to continue, the cats shall not be fed by hand and suitable implements/tools shall be utilized
when the cats are offered food with adequate distance between the public and the tigers to assure the safety of the
public as well as the cats.

The licensee acquired one skunk on June 13, 2014 from a person who was not licensed as of the date of
acquisition. This person eventually was issued a USDA license on June 18, 2014.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was a noticeable fecal odor emanating from the dog enclosure which is due to a lack of cleaning, or an
incomplete cleaning, in and around this area.
All excreta shall be removed daily to reduce disease hazards and odors.

3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The outdoor food storage and preparation continues to be dirty and contains potentially toxic chemicals and sprays
in open areas. Surfaces where food is stored and prepared is covered with dust, dirt, & dried blood and it appears
that these surfaces are not being cleaned with any regularity.
The method of storing potentially toxic chemicals and sprays and the buildup of dirt, dust, and dried blood, does not
protect the food from contamination. All food shall be stored in areas that are maintained in a clean fashion and
away from anything that can potentially be toxic if accidentally spilled on the food and subsequently ingested by theanimals.
The following enclosures had scattered accumulations of loose fiberfill &/or stuffing materials that have come from
stuffed animals and other objects that have been chewed/shredded by the animals: Pig/goat enclosure, raccoon
enclosure located at the top of the property, leopards enclosure, cougar enclosure, 2 raccoons enclosure.
These materials pose a risk of esophageal, intestinal or stomach blockage if the animals should ingest this material.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were observed in both the leopard and the adjacent panther enclosures. Rodents can bite
as well carry disease and parasites which can be transmitted to animals through these bites, their feces, or
ectoparasites that they might carry.
A safe and effective program of rodent control shall be implemented to reduce the rodents in and around the animal
enclosures to prevent diseases and injuries.
