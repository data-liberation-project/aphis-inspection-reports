INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC has not been submitting reports of its evaluations to the Institutional Official. The IACUC has been
meeting every six months and preparing minutes documenting its discussions and facility inspection. A new chair
and community member joined this past year.
The IACUC must prepare reports of its evaluations of the program and facility and submit the reports to the
Institutional Official of the teaching facility. The reports shall be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC
members and must include any minority views. The reports shall be updated at least once every six months upon
completion of the required semiannual evaluations. The reports must: contain a description of the nature and extent
of any deficiency; state the reasons for each departure; distinguish significant deficiencies from minor deficiencies;
and contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.
To be corrected from this day forth with future IACUC meetings by submitting reports to the Institutional Official.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Instructional Lab Assistants.
