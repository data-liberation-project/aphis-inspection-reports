ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One Sika Buck and one Fallow Buck were observed to have overgrown hooves. The toes on both bucks were long
and were turning inward due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can
cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s program of preventative
veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the large deer enclosure some of the metal fencing protecting the trees was in disrepair. Portions of the fencing
were creating several sharp points that were pointing outward in the enclosure. Also, in the deer shed there were
two screws that were pointing outward where the deer could easily come into contact with the sharp points.
The secondary fence the licensee was building in front of the Fallow Buck's pen had exposed sharp points that were
exposed in the Fallow Buck's pen and in the Miniature Donkey's pen. The buck and donkey can become injured if
they come into contact with these exposed sharp points of the fence.
In the Fallow Buck's pen the corner of the shed's tin roof was bent downward and created a sharp exposed edge
that could come into contact with the buck and cause injury.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points and protruding edges in order to protect the
animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.

3.130WATERING.
In a few of the animal pens, the black plastic drinking bowls were dirty and had a green slimy film on the interior
sides and bottom. In some bowls there was a green, brown slimy film on top of the water in addition to covering the
interior of the bowls. It is the responsibility of the licensee to make sure all water receptacles be kept clean and
sanitary for the overall health and well-being of the animal.
