FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bear pen has a 8 foot fence with strands of "hot wire" that are utilized as an additional measure to contain the
bears. At the time of the inspection this "hot wire" was not working.
The 8 foot enclosure fence is not sufficient alone to prevent the bears from climbing out & to adequately contain
these bears. The "hot wire" should be operational at all times. The housing facilities shall be maintained in good
repair to contain the animals at all times.
The elevated wooden walking/resting surface on the left side in the panther enclosure has been clawed by the cats
at its' end. This now has created splinters and a raised nail head which can potentially injure these cats.
All enclosures shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

FEEDING.
Currently the licensee does not feed a commercial diet to his cats. There is no written, veterinarian, approved diet
plan. The written diet should specify the type, quantity, and frequency of any nutritional supplements.
The meat is thawed for extended periods in tubs containing standing water in which the meat sits. This method of
thawing promotes the risk of contamination by bacteria and the attraction of flies, Frozen meats must be handled
appropriately to prevent contamination (e.g., thawed under refrigeration).
All food that is fed must be wholesome and free of contamination. Your veterinarian must approve (in writing) a
feeding plan for all cats.
