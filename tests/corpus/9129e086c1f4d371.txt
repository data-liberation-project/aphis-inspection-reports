3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several months ago a keeper was cleaning the New Guinea Singing Dogs' enclosure and instead of following
protocol and putting the dogs in an approved temporary enclosure while cleaning, the keeper put them in an
enclosure that did not have a top on it. One of the dogs either climbed or jumped out of the enclosure and killed two
1-year-old red kangaroos. Animals that are not properly contained in an adequate enclosure can escape, resulting
in injury to themselves or to other animals. The licensee must ensure that all animals are contained in enclosures
that are designed and maintained to prevent escape and injury.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
