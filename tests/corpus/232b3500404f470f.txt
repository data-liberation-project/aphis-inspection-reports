FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure housing the white tiger still has very little bedding. The expected low temperature in the area is -4
degrees tonight. Adequate bedding must be provided to keep this animal from experiencing unnecessary
discomfort. Provide this animal with adequate bedding in its shelter.
This focused inspection was conducted to address the direct NCIs from the inspection conducted on 2-10-15.
The animals cited in need of veterinary evaluation have been seen by the attending veterinarian and treatment
plans have been implemented. The hoof stock enclosures all have adequate bedding.
