FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were at least 11 guinea pigs seen outside of their enclosures in the corner by the food storage area. The
facility wasn't sure how/why these guinea pigs were loose. While they were seen to have access to food and water,
there is a large hole in the corner of the building that they could get out of the building and no longer be protected.
The loose animals are also starting to make a mess of the food storage area. To protect their health and safety
determine how guinea pigs are getting out of primary enclosures and ensure that all guinea pigs are safely
contained.

3.25(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The food and bedding storage area has problems that increase risk of contamination or infestation with
vermin/pests.
-A hole in the SE corner of the building could allow vermin entry.
-The loose guinea pigs have eaten out and nested in the bottom portion of the stored hay.
-Some medicine and construction materials were stored on top of the hay.
-Dark soiled material under and around pallets of guinea pig feed had strong odors and flies on it.
These problems increase the risk of contamination to the stored feed and if feed is contaminated it can affect many
animals. To protect the stored food and bedding ensure to correct the items listed above.

SANITATION.
Seven enclosures containing a total of 60 guinea pigs had visibly wet bedding in the entire enclosure. With the wet
spring the facility reports (and it could be observed) that water from the uphill side is draining under the concrete of
affected enclosures possibly subbing up into part of the building. Wet and soiled bedding can cause animal
discomfort and increase disease risk. Ensure the animals in these 7 enclosures are transferred to clean and dry
enclosures and if any other enclosures are affected ensure they are moved to dry and clean enclosures. Correct by 6/19/19.
