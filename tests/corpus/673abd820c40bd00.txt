ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1215 on
28-JAN-20.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the front door and rang the doorbell. I also honked my horn. I then waited
at the end of the driveway for thirty minutes.
End of report.
