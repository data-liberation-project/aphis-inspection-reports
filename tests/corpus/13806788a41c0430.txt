ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:35 AM on
17-Apr-18.Inspector attempted to contact licensee by knocking on the door, opening the kennel door and yelling
hello, calling the phone number on file, going next door to the parents house, talking to Mr. Ramer's mother who
said she thought he was home, calling the number on file again, knocking on the door, knocking on the kennel door
and waiting 30 minutes for a response to the phone messages. This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
