OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In an area behind the house, there are over hanging tree branches that are in contact with the perimeter fence.
There is also a fence panel in this area that is less than 6 feet high. Although there is a wire kick-in present, this
portion of the fence is next to a mound of dirt which diminishes the fence's effective height.The fence must be
constructed and maintained so that it protects nonhuman primates by restricting unauthorized humans, and animals
the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from entering the animal areas and having contact with the nonhuman
primates.
