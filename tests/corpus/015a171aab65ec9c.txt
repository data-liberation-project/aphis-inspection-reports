3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Enclosures/shelters in contact with dogs must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. The eleven shelters in
the
outdoor housing units have grease/grim/stains and dirt on the inside and outside. The owner stated the shelters
were
sanitized in March of 2016. The owner must clean daily and then sanitized all hard surfaces that dogs are in
contact
with at least once every two weeks and more often if needed. Proper sanitization can help alleviate diseases and
give dogs a healthier place to reside. The owner must sanitize these shelters. Correct by 08-08-2016.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner and Karl Thornton, ACI.
