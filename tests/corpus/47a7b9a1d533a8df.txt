PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The flooring of the rabbit enclosure housing one brown and white rabbit consists partially of wooden planks and in
one area wire over an opening approximately 9x12 in in size. The space between some of the planks is large
enough (almost an inch wide) that one of the rabbit's feet may become caught. The wire also has large openings
(about 3/4inx1in) through which a rabbit foot may fall. The rabbit may injure a foot or leg in these openings. The
floors of rabbit enclosures shall be constructed so as to protect the rabbit's feet and legs from injury. Correct by Oct.
