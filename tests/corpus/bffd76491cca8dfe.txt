2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female pygmy goat was observed limping on its left hind leg during the time of inspection. A facility employee stated
the goat was observed limping two days prior to the inspection and was isolated from the herd, but the veterinarian had
not been contacted as of the time of inspection. The goat, black, white and gray in color, was observed bearing only
partial weight on its left rear leg as it walked. Additionally, the animal’s stance was abnormal as its two rear hooves nearly
touched each other when it stood still. The goat’s leg injury could be painful and may worsen if left untreated.

This animal’s condition must be reported to the veterinarian to assure the use of appropriate methods to diagnose and
treat injuries. Assure any/all prescribed treatments and instructions are completed.

Note: The licensee called and left a message for the veterinarian during the time of inspection.
