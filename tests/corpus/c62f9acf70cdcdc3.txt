ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of this inspection there is no documentation of the environment enhancement plan to promote the
psychological well-being of the three lemurs in their enclosure. The plan must document enrichment by providing
means of expressing noninjurious species typical activities. Examples include providing increased cage complexity,
providing objects to manipulate, varied food items or foraging opportunities. To be corrected by: March 31, 2017.
3.85 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
Facilities with nonhuman primates must have enough employees to carry out the level of husbandry and care as
described in the Animal Welfare regulations. There continues to be an insufficient number of trained zoo keepers
with the knowledge, background, and experience in proper animal husbandry. Insufficient staffing is a concern
because it affects animal safety and well-being. This is a repeat, non-compliant item.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The majority of the concrete surface in the bear moat has eroded and the underlying concrete is exposed. The
concrete surface material is chipped and broken and could potentially be ingested by the bears. The area of
damaged moat concrete inside this bear enclosure must be repaired in order to avoid accidental ingestion by the
two animals housed in this exhibit. This is a repeat non-compliant item.
Approximately 70 feet of chain link fencing on the "train station" side of the longhorn enclosure is curling inwards
towards the two animals housed in this enclosure. This chain link fencing is not adequate to contain a large animal
such as a longhorn as evidenced by the outward leaning posts where the animals have pushed on the fencing. This
is a repeat non-complaint item.
Approximately 50 feet of chain link fencing in front of the bison holding pen is curling upward and outward along the
service alley. This chain link fencing has broken sharp points which could potentially injure an animal. This is a
repeat non-compliant item.The interior of the off-exhibit holding building shared by the 2 bobcat and the 2 coatimundi is very rusted and has a
single small zookeeper roof access "hatch" for cleaning. This set-up makes it extremely hard to adequately clean
and sanitize the interior of this building. This building must be repaired or replaced to enable keeper access to this
area. To be corrected by: March 31, 2017.
The storage building behind the round pen housing two foxes is full of construction debris and other materials. The
exterior siding on this building appears to be deteriorating along the bottom at ground level. This interior of this
building must be cleaned and the exterior repaired to prevent possible rodent infestation. To be corrected by:
March 31, 2017.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with city officials on February 21 & 22, 2017.
