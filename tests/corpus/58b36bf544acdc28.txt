2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Chihuahua (microchip #OAO1374058) has excessively long nails on both front and back feet and the
toenails are starting to develop a severe curve. Overgrown toenails interfere with the ability of the dog to stand
normally and can get caught in the wire cage flooring causing injury to the dog’s foot.
The licensee needs to trim the dog’s nails to an acceptable length. Licensee must insure that the toenails of all dogs
are kept at an acceptable length at all times.
The dog’s nails were cut by the facility representative at the time of the inspection.
3.6(c)(1)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The primary enclosures of three dogs in the whelping area were not of appropriate size to allow for 6 inches of head
space above the dogs’ heads. Failure to provide dogs with adequate head space may not allow for freedom of
movement and normal postural behaviors.
Licensee must provide primary enclosures for dogs that include at a minimum of 6 inches of headspace above the
dogs’ heads to ensure the dog’s health and well-being.
Correction date: The 3 dogs were moved to compliant enclosures by the facility representative at the time of the
inspection.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and Kelly Maxwell ACI and Katie
Steneroden VMO. Additional Inspectors
