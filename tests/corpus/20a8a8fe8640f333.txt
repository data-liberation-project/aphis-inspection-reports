HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the chimpanzee sleeping quarters, there are sections where paint is peeling and the underlying concrete surface
is exposed. The exposed surfaces are porous and cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Documentation
provided indicates a work order to repair the affected areas was requested on February 7, 2013, and at time of
inspection, had not yet been completed. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized poses a risk to the
health of the animals due to potential exposure to infectious organisms or other contaminants.
In the Gibbon enclosure, there is a heavy amount of paint peeling from the ceiling support beams. The surfaces
cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. In addition, the peeling paint poses a risk to the animals' health and
well-being as they may ingest the paint flakes.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled.

3.80(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A 9-year-old orangutan, Berani, escaped from her exhibit through a small hole in the steel mesh. According to a
facility representative, Berani was darted and attended to by the veterinary staff. She was moved back to her living
quarters and is now being housed in the dayroom with Bruno. Both Berani and Bruno have escaped from their
enclosures in the past and are now being housed in an area where the keepers can watch them throughout the day.
According to a keeper in this area, after the incident, the steel mesh was immediately repaired and the remaining
mesh inspected. The keeper also mentioned the enclosure is inspected daily for holes or unraveling of the
mesh.The enclosure appears at least 20 feet high, and although the keeper mentioned they use binoculars for
inspection, the steel mesh blends in with the background/ scenery and small tears can be difficult to detect.
Given this history, the staff cannot exclude the possibility of another escape. According to a facility representative,the zoo is planning to replace the existing mesh with a thicker wired mesh. Until the exhibit mesh is replaced, further
evaluation of the construction, daily inspection, and maintenance of the enclosure is needed. Failure to construct
primary enclosures of suitable materials and/ or maintain them so that they are structurally sound for the species of
non-human primates contained in them could adversely affect the health and well being of the animals as well as
members of the general public, if an escape occurs.
A written plan and a time line which outlines which corrective actions will be implemented to prevent future escapes
should be submitted to the USDA/ APHIS /Animal Care - Western Regional Office, 2150 Centre Ave., Bldg. B, MS
3W11, Fort Collins, CO 80526

Note: This steel mesh is also used in the construction of another enclosure which houses non-human primates. This
area was also discussed with the facility representatives.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On the south end of the facility, there are wooden pallets laying up against a section of the perimeter fence.The
pallets lessen the effective height of the perimeter fence and may assist an animal in the event of an escape. In
addition, portions of the barbed wire at the top of the perimeter fence are in disrepair. The perimeter fence should
be maintained in good repair and items which lessen the effective height of the perimeter fence removed.

The wooden pallets were removed at time of inspection.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
In the giraffe barn, there is a heavy accumulation of cobwebs present in the skylights. Cobwebs can collect dust and
other particles which can pose a risk to the health of the animals.The facility should ensure that their staff monitors
all areas of the barn, including the difficult to reach areas, to minimize an excessive build up of cobwebs. Animal
areas should be kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.

SANITATION.
There were rodent droppings present in the back areas of the Bongos' and duikers' enclosures. Although bating
stations and rodent traps were noted in the areas, fecal matter and two snapped rodent traps were observed.
According to the facility representative, the rodent traps were set earlier in the day and were not effective in
preventing the rodents from entering the area. Also noted was a cutting board and a syringe being stored on a ledge
where rodent droppings were identified. In addition, a knife used for food preparation was observed on a pallet just
off the ground.
The facility should establish and maintain a safe and effective program for the control of mammalian pests. Food
preparation utensils and medical supplies should be stored in a manner that minimizes their risk of contamination.

An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
