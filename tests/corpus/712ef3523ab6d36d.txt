FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The facility is currently housing a North American Porcupine in the upstairs room and area of the home. The
animal has free access to an area that is not designed for the animal but is a living space for the licensee, so there
are a variety of potential hazards for this animal. There was an enclosure the animal is secured in nightly but the
area does not provide enough vertical space for species appropriate movement. This animal needs to be housed in
a primary enclosure that meets its species specific needs and is designed to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animal.
