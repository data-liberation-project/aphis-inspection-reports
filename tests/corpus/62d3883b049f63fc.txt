PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During inspection two eight week old puppies had access to the outdoor area where the floor panels have larger
holes than in the sheltered area. The puppies' feet were seen passing through the holes during inspection. When
puppies' legs pass through the floor they could get injured. The facility must ensure that the floors are constructed to
not allow the dogs' or puppies' legs to pass through any openings in the floor.
Correct from this day forward. Note: The facility safely blocked the puppies' access to this area so that their feet
aren't passing through the floor. Ensure the floor is fixed so feet don't pass through prior to allowing puppy access
to the outdoor area.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
