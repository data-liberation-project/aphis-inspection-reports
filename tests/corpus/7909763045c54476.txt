3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure housing 3 collared peccaries had several areas in which the lathe (metal framework) under the
gunite was exposed and twisted with sharp points. The building materials were not maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury.
Failure to maintain housing and exhibit facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The
affected structures must be repaired or replaced and all facilities should be maintained and kept structurally sound
to protect and contain the animals moving forward.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted on-site with the C.O.O.
