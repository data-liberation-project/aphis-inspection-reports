2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The last inventory of the number of animals on hand was documented on 6/19/21 and only included adult guinea pigs.
The facility is not maintaining a current inventory of all animals on hand including adults, weanlings, and newborns.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.
3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
There was one guinea pig pen that did not provide the required amount of floor space. There were 41 weanling guinea
pigs less than 350 grams in size housed in a pen that measured approximately 51 inches by 35 inches or 1,785 square
inches of floor space. Each weanling requires a minimum of 60 square inches of floor space. Total floor space required
to house these weanlings is 2,460 square inches. There cannot be more than 29 weanling guinea pigs housed in an
enclosure measuring 1,785 square inches.


Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, and aggression in animals.
The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs are provided with the minimum amount of floor space in order to avoid
overcrowding and to support the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.
3.29(d)

Feeding.
Approximately 25% of the guinea pig enclosures had self-feeders with a large amount of ground up powder and caked
feed in the trough of the feeder and little to no pelleted feed available.
Failure to provide access to pelleted feed can lead to decreased feed consumption which may negatively affect the health
of the animals.
The facility must ensure measures are taken to prevent deterioration or caking of the feed in the self feeders.
