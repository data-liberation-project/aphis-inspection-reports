INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) only met once in 2015 and once so far in 2016. The
meetings were held on April 21, 2015 and February 16, 2016. As a result, the facility was not able to meet the
following requirements:
(1) Review, at least once every six months, the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals,
using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A--Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation.
(2) Inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research facility's animal facilities, including animal study
areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A-Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation; Provided, however, That
animal areas containing free-living wild animals in their natural habitat need not be included in such inspection.
(3) Prepare reports of its evaluations conducted as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, and submit
the reports to the Institutional Official of the research facility.
Inadequate program oversight may be detrimental to the welfare of the animals used in the program. A system must
be in place and maintained to ensure that IACUC oversight of the facility is in compliance with the Animal Welfare
Act.
Correct for all future inspections.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In several rabbit barns, uncovered light bulbs are hung over a portion of the rabbit enclosures, particularly over food
receptacles. In the event of breakage, rabbits could be injured by shattered glass. A system should be in place to
ensure light sources in animal facilities are maintained in a manner that doesn't pose a risk to the animals.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to
protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.
