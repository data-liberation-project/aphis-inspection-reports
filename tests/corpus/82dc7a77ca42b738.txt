3.78(d)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The facility housed three black-and-white ruffed lemurs in an outdoor enclosure which was not surrounded by a
continuous 6-foot perimeter fence. The lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within
the facility in that there isn’t an adequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary
enclosures or a sufficient barrier to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The facility must ensure that the above
listed animals being housed outdoors are enclosed by a 6-foot perimeter fence at least 3 feet in distance from the primary
enclosure or shall obtain a variance from the regional office. To be corrected by March 22, 2023.
3.80(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
Within the primary enclosure housing 2 males and 1 female black-and-white ruffed lemurs, three metal rods extended
from the metal ceiling panel. Sharp points could be appreciated. Within the primary enclosure housing a male ring-tailed
lemur, there were several exposed wires in the ceiling and a container of Windex was present on the floor next to the door
of the enclosure. Housing structures in disrepair could cause harm to the animals if not well-maintained. Accessible
chemicals could cause harm or injury to the animals if not maintained in appropriate locations. Primary enclosures must


be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or chemicals that could injure the nonhuman primates.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
A current appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman
primates was not available at time of inspection. This plan should be available to APHIS inspectors upon request. The
plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards, and as directed by the attending
veterinarian. The licensee must ensure said plan is available upon request. To be corrected by February 1, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
