2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The one zebu bull was observed to have overgrown hooves that extended outward and were beginning to arch
upward. The nails on all feet were long due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to appropriately maintain
hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s program
of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a
timely manner.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
