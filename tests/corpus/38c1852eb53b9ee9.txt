2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
On 2/14/22 an infant marmoset was found dead in its enclosure. It was determined that there was a hole in the middle
layer of a three-tiered hammock, allowing the animal to become stuck and unable to free itself. The three-tiered
hammocks had been in use for years at the facility as part of the enrichment program with no previous issues.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
The facility has since corrected this issue by implementing an SOP for inspection of enrichment items and conducting
retraining sessions of staff. In addition, the use of three-tiered hammocks has been discontinued.
******Corrected

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
