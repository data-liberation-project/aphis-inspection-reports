HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the hamadryas baboons enclosure there was chipping of the paint and rusting on the bars of the primary
enclosure. The surfaces of the housing facilities must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow
them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Any surfaces of the housing
facilities that come in contact with nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required
cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface. Correct by April 24, 2014.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the wolves and tigers primary enclosure there were several broken wire tie-downs at the bottom of the fencing
posts. At the top of the right side of the wolves primary enclosure the horizontal fencing post had 3 areas that were
rusted and pitted to where one section had split. Also on the left side of the primary enclosure near the tree the
fencing post had rusted and pitted. The primary enclosure must be constructed of such material and of such
strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall
be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by April 10, 2014
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The perimeter fencing of the facility had several areas where tree branches had come down on the barbed wire
and the fencing posts. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting
animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the
facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. Correct by April
