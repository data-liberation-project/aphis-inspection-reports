RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee acquired 1 cat hybrid on 6/1/13, & 3 cat hybrids on 6/9/13 from two different sources. These
acquisitions were the only ones in the past year that were from non USDA licensed individuals.
In each of these acquisitions, the licensee did not obtain the driver's license number AND vehicle tag number from
the persons from whom these cats were acquired. The licensee also could not locate the addresses of these
individuals during the inspection.
For all acquisitions from non USDA licensed individuals you must obtain that person's, address, driver's license
number and state, and the vehicle tag number and state.
Correct immediately.

injure the cats.

3.11(c)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The surrounding grounds where the front cat enclosures are located has a very large accumulation of feces from
several different species of animals.
These accumulations can, and do, attract flies (especially during the summer months), as well as vermin and do not
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices that are required.
Premises where housing facilities are located, including surrounding grounds, must be kept clean to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices that are required, as well as to reduce other pests and vermin.
