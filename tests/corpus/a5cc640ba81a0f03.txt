REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
Records indicate the intermediate handler's registration was not renewed and was thereafter canceled in June
2015. Between August and December 2015, it was discovered via inspection of records from other licensed
facilities that the intermediate handler (or an employee operating under the same business name) transported
animals to destinations within and outside the state. All of these transportations occurred without an active
registration. It is critical for intermediate handlers to maintain their registration with USDA to allow adequate
regulatory oversight. A registration form must be filed and updated every 3 years to ensure continued registration
with USDA.
Correct by re-registering with the USDA as an intermediate handler prior to any further transportation of regulated
animals.

NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
The intermediate handler has moved the business address and did not notify the USDA in a timely manner.
Business has been conducted from the new address for at least 6 months (since August 2015). Failure to notify the
USDA of changes in business address causes errors and gaps in communication. All registrants shall notify Animal
Care officials by certified mail of any change in the name, address, ownership, or other changes in operations within
10 days of making such change. Correct by ensuring that AC is notified of all pertinent changes in an appropriate
and timely manner.
Correct by: from this time forward.
The inspection of records was conducted from November 23, 2015 through January 8, 2016. An exit interview was
conducted with the registrant on February 8, 2016, by the undersigned VMO.
