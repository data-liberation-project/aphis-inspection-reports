OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are six dogs (hybrids) that are in an outdoor fenced in area, with two shelter areas and some platforms for the
animals to lay on that are made of wood that is not sealed. The metal supports holding up the platforms have some
rust on the surfaces that can come in contact with the regulated animals.
Surfaces that are not sealed or have rust on them are not impervious to moisture and can not be readily cleaned or
sanitized to get rid of dirt and bacteria.
All surfaces that the dogs come in contact with must be impervious to moisture to allow for proper cleaning and
sanitization. Any unsealed wood must be sealed or replaced with materials that are impervious to moisture, and any
rusty structures should be treated, repaired if needed or replaced.
