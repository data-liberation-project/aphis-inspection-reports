Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 265 adult, weanling,
and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of
adults, weanlings, or newborns present for the last few months.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Facilities, indoor.
The temperature in the guinea pig housing facility was 47.4 degrees F as measured with a kestrel. There was a heater
that was not turned on and there was a draft from the windows that were wire mesh covered with plastic. Guinea pigs
were observed huddling together or gathering under piles of hay in the enclosures.


Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort and
predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

Facilities, indoor.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig housing areas. This was a result of soiled enclosures
in need of more frequent cleaning.
Failure to provide fresh air can cause respiratory distress and expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.

Sanitation.
The majority of the guinea pigs pens had a thick buildup of soiled bedding 2-3 inches deep. There was one pen (pen 33)
with no bedding and only fecal material present. The facility representative was unsure when the pens had last been
cleaned.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure,
and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material and
sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.

Sanitation.
There was a large amount of discarded bedding, hay, and debris on the floor under and around the guinea pig pens.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and
may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.
