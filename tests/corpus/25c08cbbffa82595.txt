2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
This licensee presented for transport a lion cub under 28 days of age. The cub was transported from their facility to the
receiving facility by the receiving licensee. The licensee reports that the cub was born on 28 June 2020. There are
inconsistent dates listed on the supporting documentation for this transport. The Certificate of Veterinary Inspection states
a shipping date of 15 July 2020 (17 days of age). The APHIS 7020 form provided by the licensee shows a signed
disposition date of 19 July 2020 (21 days of age). Neonatal nondomestic cats have special handing and husbandry needs
and are placed in danger when they are exposed to members of the public and/or stressful conditions, including
transportation. Cubs under 4 weeks of age (28 days) do not have a developed immune system, are susceptible to a wide
variety of diseases including those of domestic cats, and cannot thermoregulate. The licensee must ensure that handling
of all animals be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating,
excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. To be corrected from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
