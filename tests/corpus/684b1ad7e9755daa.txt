2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The Jacob sheep in the walk-through portion of the park had no public barrier and no park employees were
present. The facility representative stated that the public had access to the area without constant park employee
supervision. She stated that employees came and went from the area during the day as they performed their duties.
- A sheep and llama in the walk-through zoo had escaped their enclosure and were in their public barrier area. A
goat from this enclosure had escaped the public barrier area as well and was free in the park. The facility
representative stated that the public had access to the area without constant park employee supervision. She stated
that employees came and went from the area during the day as they performed their duties. These animals are in a
location which would allow them to easily have contact with members of the public.
3.125(a) DIRECT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The enclosure housing the sheep, goat and llama have a single shelter which contained the only food and water
available to the animals. This shelter has three entrances allowing access to the shelter. All three entrances had
numerous dangling wires that are in contact with the animals as they enter the shelter. The middle entrance had five
loosely hung horizontal wires approximately six inches apart. These wires covered an area from the roof to
approximately 3 feet from the ground. The outer entrances had multiple wires of various length hanging vertically
from the roof. Since these wires obstruct all potential entrances the animals cannot avoid contacting the wires and
are in danger of entrapment or other injury every time they attempt to gain access to their food or water. These
wires must be removed or secured to avoid obstructing access to the shelter.
To be corrected immediately.
3.125(b)
FACILITIES, GENERAL. - Two cavys being kept in an outdoor enclosure in the walk-through area of the park have an area of the fence that
is rolled at the bottom and has sharp points exposed to the animals. This area of rolled fence is approximately 3 foot
in length and is raised off the bottom of the enclosure approximately 2 to 3 inches. This section of fencing is a
potential source of injury or entrapment to the enclosed animals. This fencing must be removed or repaired. All
enclosures must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury.

WATERING.
- The enclosure housing the goat, llama, and sheep had a single water receptacle. The water was greenish in color
and particulate material was floating as well as settled on the bottom. There were also many live larvae and insects
present in the water.
- The kangaroo enclosure had a single water receptacle. The water was greenish in color and particulate material
was present. There was reddish brown rust like material scattered on the bottom of the receptacle and several dead
insects were present. Water receptacles must be cleaned and contain potable water. More frequent cleaning and
sanitizing is needed.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
- Throughout the walk through area of the zoo there were multiple areas that contained an excessive overgrowth of
weeds and foilage in close proximity to the enclosures. The primary areas affected were the kangaroo and the
Jacob's sheep pens. Weed overgrowth is a potential source of harborage for insects and other pests, and may
negatively impact the enclosed animals. The facility must maintain the premises and keep weeds and other
vegetation under control.
