2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male Chinese pug with tag number 14 has problems with his right eye. The surface of the eye (cornea) is
uneven in appearance with areas that are thick and white and an area that is dark in color. The "(cid:28)white"(cid:29) of the right
eye is more red than the other eye and there are prominent blood vessels visible there and on the cornea. Eye
problems can be a result of trauma, infection, and other medical problems and can be painful. The licensee must
have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of business on 28 January 2016 in order to ensure that
an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee
must document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request.
3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are metal panels located along the lower edges of the outdoor portions of several enclosures of the "Terrier
Turf" building and the "Tiny Tike" building that have flaking paint and are starting to rust. Surfaces that have flaking
paint and are rusted cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces must be maintained to allow them to be
readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 27 April 2016.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are three Saint Bernard dogs housed in an outdoor housing facility. There is some bedding in the shelter
structure but it is dirty and mostly pushed to the side of the shelter so that not all three dogs can make use of it.
While the temperature at the time of inspection was 54.7 degrees F making bedding unnecessary at that moment, a
search on the NOAA website (weather.gov) for the licensee'(cid:25)s zip code shows the low temperature the previous
night was 21 degrees F. Lack of bedding in cold weather can result in dogs that cannot maintain a safe body
temperature. The licensee must provide clean, dry bedding material when the ambient temperature is below 50
degrees F and additional bedding when the temperature is below 35 degrees F. This was corrected during the
inspection.3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an excessive accumulation of feces in at least 10 of the outdoor elevated portions of the "Village Inn"
building. According to the representative these enclosures were last cleaned 6 days ago. Accumulations of feces
can increase disease transmission and can soil the dogs in these enclosures. Excreta must be removed from
primary enclosures on a daily basis. This was corrected at the time of the inspection.
This routine inspection was conducted on 27 January 2016 with facility representatives, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO
and Kendall Lundy, ACI.
The exit interview was conducted on 28 January 2016 with facility representatives, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO and
