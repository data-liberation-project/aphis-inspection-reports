FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following enclosure fences are in need of repair/replacement:
1) Camel enclosure: The fencing along the side of the camel enclosure adjacent to the main path is loose and
pushed down by the camel leaning on the topline of the fence. Camel hair is stuck to the fencing where the camel
has leaned his neck and head on the fence. The fencing along the side of the camel enclosure adjacent to the path
leading to the deer enclosure had a tree limb fall on it leading to structural weakening and loosening of one section
of the fencing. There are a couple of sharp points projecting from wires along the fence line between the camel and
cow enclosures.
2) Goat/Zdonk enclosure: One section of the fencing along the main path is loose and bowed out.
Loose/structurally unsound fencing and sharp points on damaged wire fencing can lead to injury of the animals and
possible escape of the animals. All outdoor housing enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair. Correct by Sept. 15, 2014.
Exit conducted with facility representative.
