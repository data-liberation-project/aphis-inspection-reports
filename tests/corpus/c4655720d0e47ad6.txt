3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor portion of the "whelping" building there were two enclosures housing two female adult dogs and a
total of nineteen puppies that had a build-up of feces on and in the "tenderfoot" type flooring. The licensee stated
that he scrapes it daily, but it has been several weeks since it has been fully cleaned and sanitized. The build-up of
feces can create a disease hazard, and does not allow the dogs to utilize the outdoor space without stepping on a
soiled surface.
Throughout the facility there was a build-up of brown residue on a majority of the wall surfaces and egress doors.
The licensee says that he only cleans and sanitizes by power-washing two to three times a year in the "big dog"
building and between litters in the whelping building. The build-up of organic material can cause a disease hazard.
The licensee must spot-clean ALL hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact with daily and sanitized in
accordance with 3.11(b), at least every two weeks or more often if necessary, to prevent accumulation of feces and
reduce disease hazards.
