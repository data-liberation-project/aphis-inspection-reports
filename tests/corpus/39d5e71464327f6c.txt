MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on28-Dec-17 at 11:35 PM.
Arrived at facility, attempted to make contact via lobby phone and also left a voicemail for the IACUC Coordinator.
Eventually someone arrived, and put me in contact with an IT person on site, who stated that there were no animals
on site, and that there were no responsible personnel on site on this day. Departed facility at 12:00 PM.
