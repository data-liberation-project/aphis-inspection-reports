3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The primary enclosure housing kangaroos in the front of the facility as well as a second enclosure housing
kangaroos toward the rear of the facility are not completely enclosed by perimeter fences. Both enclosures have
areas where the animals can be secured by a perimeter fence, however, they have 24 hour access to large
exercise yards. The exercise yards are not adequately enclosed by perimeter fences. The front enclosure lacks a
perimeter fence on three sides and the rear enclosure is not surrounded by a perimeter fence on at least one side.
All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height (6 feet) to keep
unwanted animals and people out. The fence is also required to prevent unauthorized persons from having contact
with the animals and to fuction as a secondary containment system. The required perimeter fencing must surround
outdoor housing facilities or approval obtained from the Administrator.
