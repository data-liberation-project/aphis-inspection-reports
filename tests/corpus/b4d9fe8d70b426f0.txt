care of the dogs and must include information regarding preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted
hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth. The written PVC for dogs must be
updated to include the information required for preventative care of the dogs. Correct by 6/12/22
