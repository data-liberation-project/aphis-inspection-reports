ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The black bear "Rick" was reluctant to move and took a long time to get up. He was first on his back and had to rock
to get up. Once sitting upright he scooted to reposition himself. He then got up on all fours but pivoted to turn
around but did not walk. He sat down carefully and slowly and did not attempt to get up again. He also has an
abundance of winter coat that has not shedded yet. There seemed to be discomfort in getting up and sitting down
which needs to be addressed by the attending veterinarian. The facility must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by August 29, 2016

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a goat that was observed with his nose deviated to the right that appears to be facial paralysis. The
animal does not show signs of pain or discomfort but needs to assessed by the attending veterinarian. The owner
must consult their attending veterinarian on health concerns of the animals in a timely manner in order to provide
the proper diagnoses and treatments to ensure good health and well being of the animals. Correct by September 2,
2016.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
** The facility needs to update their inventory of animals on hand. There are two goats recorded on the inventory
that are not on the premises. It is unclear as to where the animals are or if it was an inaccurate count of goats on
hand. The exhibitor shall make, keep and maintain records or forms which correctly disclose the information of the
animals The records shall also include offspring born of any animals while in his possession or under his control.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wood panel on the outside of the macaques enclosure is degraded and in disrepair. Housing facilities for
nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound and kept in good repair.Correct by September 26, 2016
3.75(c) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** On the inside of the brown lemur, macaques', baboon and spider monkeys' night houses the wood surfaces are
soiled and can not be readily cleaned and sanitized. There are stains that were present at the previous inspection.
The owner states that he is cleaning the insides of the houses but the same stains are still present and therefore
can not be cleaned and need to be repaired and/or replaced. In "Juanita" the olive baboons enclosure there was a
green film and black spots that resembled mold on the wood beams, posts and perches. The owner spray painted
these areas in hopes to fix it but that is not an appropriate fix. If the wood surfaces can not be cleaned and sanitized
then the wood should be replaced. The other surfaces must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that
allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled for the good health and
well-being of the animals.
3.80(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
** In the enclosure containing ten ring tailed lemurs, there were pieces of wire about 2-3 inches long that was
attached to the chain link fence that could cause an injury. The enclosure should be constructed and maintained so
no sharp points could injure the nonhuman primates.
3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The macaques, baboon and spider monkey enrichment programs described having fire hoses and other swings in
the enclosures for environmental enrichment. The fire hoses surfaces were not sanitizable and therefore had to be
removed but were never replaced. Also other interactive methods of enrichment were documented but are not
always implemented when other facility duties occur with one employee working. The physical environment in the
primary enclosures must be enriched as documented and approved by attending veterinarian by providing means of
expressing noninjurious species-typical activities. Species differences should be considered when determining the
type or methods of enrichment. Examples of environmental enrichments include providing perches, swings, mirrors,
and other increased cage complexities; providing objects to manipulate; varied food items; using foraging or
task-oriented feeding methods; and providing interaction with the care giver or other familiar and knowledgeable
person consistent with personnel safety precautions. Correct by September 9, 2016.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL. In the brown lemurs night house there was an infestation of bugs. They covered the wood beam above the cage.
Also in the baboons night house there was insect excrement scattered on the floor. An effective program for control
of insects must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and
reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct by September 26, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The lioness "(cid:28)Matilda's" access door has a gap at the top of the door frame that needs to be closed. The door
must be repaired to contain the animals.
** The cougar "(cid:28)Sabrina(cid:29)'s" doorway, from her enclosure to the adjacent enclosure, had two 2 x 6 boards vertically
at the bottom of the opening about 3 inches apart that the cougar could put its foot down in when traveling across
the threshold. There were sharp points from a chain link fence inside the gap that could cause an injury.
** In the black bear's enclosure the roofing of the enclosure toward the right end of the pen had debris on top and
was falling down. Some of the debris has been removed but the fencing is rusted and is still sagging leaving gaps in
it. The ceiling needs to be repaired. There were also areas of the fencing that were broken with the pointy ends
sticking into the enclosure. The fencing should be repaired.
** In the enclosure for the goats and pigs there were several strands of the hay bale twine lying on the ground.
These pieces should be removed to prevent ingestion..
Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The affected
structures must be repaired or replaced and all housing facilities should be maintained and kept structurally sound
to protect and contain the animals.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The refrigerator for perishables is dirty with a foul smell and needs to be cleaned. There was also evidence of pests.
The storage is not a closed containment which may allow contamination of pests. It needs to adequately protect the
food supply from contamination and needs to be repaired and/or replaced. Correct by September 9, 2016
