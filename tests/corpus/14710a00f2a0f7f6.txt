Facilities, general.
A recent storm has caused two large trees to fall against two interior, dividing fences for the white tail deer and one male
goat. These fallen trees have crushed the top rails as well as the fence fabric leaving the fences in severe disrepair.

TO BE CORRECTED BY: DECEMBER 29, 2021

A section of the goat enclosure fence has damaged fabric as well as on the fence surrounding the tree in the goat
enclosure. This fabric has been damaged by the goats leaving it detached from the top rails. Damaged fabric could
cause injury to the goats.

Fencing must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the white-tailed deer and goats.
Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
