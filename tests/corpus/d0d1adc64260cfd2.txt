Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 13:25 - 14:52 on 9
MAR 2020.

The inspector arrived at the facility at 13:25 hrs and was greeted by a family member of the licensee who stated the
licensee was currently away. The family member reportedly called the licensee and he stated he could conduct the
inspection in one hour. The inspector waited over an hour, left three voicemail messages for the licensee, and finally left
the property after waiting 87 minutes without any direct contact with or sign of the licensee. The licensee called the
inspector from home at 15:24 hrs to apologize for missing the inspection and stated he was available, but the inspector
was already inspecting a different facility by that time.
