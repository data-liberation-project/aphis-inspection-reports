2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process from 8:45AM to
9:30AM on 10/09/2015. A person at the facility wasn't sure if licensee had left for the day; I waited in case licensee
was still there but did not see him.
