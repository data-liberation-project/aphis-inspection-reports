ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****
A young male Pug puppy, DOB 6 April 2016, was observed with abnormal eyes. The left eye has a clouded blue
appearance in the center area and appears to be abnormally shaped. The right eye is has a clouded blue
appearance in the center area with an uneven and irregular surface, approximately ¼ inch in diameter. There is
also a reddish pigment on the perimeter of the clouded, uneven and irregular surface. The licensee noticed this
condition 3 days ago and started treating him with Tobramycin Ophthalmic Solution. The licensee did not consult
with a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. The condition of the eyes could be a result of
an injury or other medical condition and could be painful. The licensee must have the puppy examined by a
veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
timely and adequate veterinary care at all time.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning
****
In a sheltered facility there is an accumulation of hair, dirt, and grime on the chain link, woven wire, wooden
dividers, and under an elevated platform in 3 enclosures, which affect 4 dogs. This accumulation of hair, dirt and
grime can become a disease hazard and does not facilitate the sanitization process. Hard surfaces with which the
dogs come into contact with must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if
necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.
