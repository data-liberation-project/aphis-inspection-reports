Sanitation.
Tall grass and weeds, up to knee height in some areas, was noted between the “D” and “E” enclosures and the perimeter
fence. Overgrown grass and weeds could allow harborage of pests and vermin that could affect the health and well-being
of the animals.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury. Weeds, grasses and bushes
must be controlled to facilitate cleaning of the premises and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents
and other pests and vermin.
