FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** On the west side of the goats primary enclosure there were several areas with pointy ends extending from the
fencing. Also on the entrance of the small catch pen inside the goats primary enclosure there are pointy ends
extending into the opening from the fencing.
** Behind the emu's pen there was a 2 x 4 with two nails protruding from both ends of it.
**The primary fencing for the llama had several posts with loose barbed wire haphazardly wrapped and the animalscould come in contact with it. Also the south side of the fencing that runs into the shed is down and in disrepair.
These areas of the primary enclosure could be injurious to the animals and needs to be repaired and/or removed.
**In the primary enclosure containing the goats and cows there were strands of hay bale twine on the ground. The
twine should be removed to prevent the animals from possible ingestion or becoming entangled in it.
**There was a goat that was in the emu's primary enclosure. The owner stated that the goat gets in and out of its
original pen. The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
contain the animals.
