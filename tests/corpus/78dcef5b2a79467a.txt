2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual reports submitted to the Institutional Officer for the past year have not been signed by a majority of
the IACUC members. Without this documentation, it cannot be verified the IACUC has reviewed and approved of
the contents of these evaluations. The semi-annual facility inspection report from July 2016 was signed by the IO to
indicate receipt, but not by a majority of the IACUC. The December 2015 semi-annual facility inspections was not
signed by the IACUC or sent to the IO. A system should be in place to ensure that all documentation required by the
Animal Welfare Act is maintained by the facility.
With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall prepare reports of
its evaluations of their program and facilities and submit the reports to the Institutional Official. The reports shall be
reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members and must include any minority views.
Correct for all future inspections.
2.31(d)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Several Amendments to existing covered species protocols were submitted to the IACUC by one of the principal
investigators or an individual who was personally involved in the activity and the same individual approved the
amendment as the current IACUC chair.
With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall review protocols
and amendments to protocols prior to approval. No member may participate in the IACUC review or approval of an
activity in which that member has a conflicting interest (e.g., is personally involved in the activity).
Correct for all future covered species amendments and protocols approved by the IACUC.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it wasdeployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on 26 August, 2016.
