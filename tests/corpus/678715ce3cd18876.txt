Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
*** Feces are not being fully removed from the floor enclosures once daily and several of the wire mesh enclosures have
feces that are not falling through the mesh to the floor. These areas need to be spot cleaned once daily and feces
removed to prevent soiling of the dogs and for their health and well being.

Veterinary care for dogs.
*** One poodle identified as # 79 "Ranger" was visibly matted in the chest area. The dog could not be handled to
determine the extent of the matted fur. This dog should be groomed prior to becoming this matted as matted fur pulls and
separates from the skin causing potential skin irritation. Grooming should be done on a scheduled basis as part of
preventative care for the dogs.
