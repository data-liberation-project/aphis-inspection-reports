3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The adult dogs have not been vaccinated for rabies and they have not been sampled for fecal parasites in accordance
with a schedule approved by the Attending Veterinarian. Not having the adult dogs vaccinated against rabies and
sampled for fecal parasites doesn't ensure they are protected against various diseases or parasites that could infect them.
All adult dogs must be vaccinated against rabies and sampled for fecal parasites. Correct by 10/27/22.
3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee stated the adult dogs are vaccinated for parvo and distemper, but records have not been kept to confirm
they were given and the dates they were administered. Not keeping records of distemper and parvo vaccines doesn't
ensure that all adult dogs have been vaccinated for these diseases. The licensee must document the names and dates of
all vaccines that have been administered to the dogs. Correct by 10/27/22.
