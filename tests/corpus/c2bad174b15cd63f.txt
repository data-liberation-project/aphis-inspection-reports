2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
According to Fulton County Animal Control, on February 2, 2020 at approximately 1:15 PM, an individual visiting
Brown’s Oakridge Zoo was bitten on the right hand by a ring tailed lemur on exhibit at Brown’s. The individual
subsequently received medical treatment, and the approximately 1-year-old ring tailed lemur named 'George'
involved in the incident was put on confinement for 30 days by the animal control official, according to the official’s
report. The licensee conveyed to USDA that an attendant was present at the time of the incident, and that according
to the attendant, the ring tailed lemur had a belly band on with a lead attached to him, yet he jumped from the
individual’s lap, causing the injury. The licensee indicated that 'George' would no longer be included in the animal
encounter experiences at the facility.
The facility must ensure that during public exhibition, all animals must be handled in a manner that provides for
minimal risk of harm to the animal (s) and the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and
the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Using an approved restraint system
and/or putting in place sufficient distance/barriers must be utilized to protect the public and the animal.
