2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(1) Veterinary care: The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility still lacks specific
guidance for the care of animals. There is no specific guidance for internal parasite control and treatment of
conditions for the various species, only a list of drugs. Species specific dosing and route is not included for the
drugs included in the PVC. Sulfadimethoxine use for rabbits and ferrets does not include a dose or route in the
PVC. There is a dosage for oral Acepromazine in the PVC with no information on the intended species or when it is
to be used. The instructions in the PVC for the Ivermectin do not include which are to be used for what species.
Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all drugs used by the licensee.

There is no specific guidance in the PVC for the method of euthanasia to be used by the facility, including its use,
equipment, and the personnel trained and authorized to perform the euthanasia for the various species. The PVC
states that the method for CO2 euthanasia will follow the AVMA Guidelines with no details on its use at the facility
by personnel. Specific guidance and training in the procedure for euthanasia by the attending veterinarian is
required to ensure animals are humanely euthanized according to the latest AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of
Animals (2013 edition).

Additional specific guidance is required for the Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate
guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does
not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by
developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility.

3.31(b)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: Rodent feces, spilled food and bedding were under and behind the pallets of food,
bedding and hay along the wall in the storage room. Spilled food on the floor attracts pests and must be removed. Rodent feces may harbor bacteria and parasites and must be cleaned up on a regular basis for the health of the
animals and to monitor pests. Correct by keeping the floor clean around and under the pallets with the food,
bedding and hay. Correct by January 21, 2016.
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(c) Pest Control: Rodent feces were observed under and behind the pallets of food, bedding and hay
along the wall in the storage room. No rodent control was observed in this area. Wild rodents may introduce
disease and parasites into the animal colonies. An effective program for the control of mammalian pests must be
established and maintained. Correct by January 21, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility president; Mary Geib, VMO; and Robert Markmann, ACI.
