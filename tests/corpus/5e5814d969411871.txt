Facilities, outdoor.
The 2 female brown bears and 1 male brown bear are co-housed in a single primary enclosure. The shelter provided to
these bears is one large metal barrel that has a diameter of 65” and measures 6' 2" long. During inspection there was
only one female brown bear noted to be in the shelter. This female brown bear was laying at the entrance of the shelter
and preventing the other brown bears from having access to the shelter. The other two brown bears were noticed to be
wet, and snow covered.
The male and female black bears are currently co-housed in the same primary enclosure. The shelter provided to these
bears is a single metal barrel that measures 5-6' long and has a diameter of 4'. The male black bear is in the shelter
preventing the female black bear access to the shelter. The female black bear was wet, and had snowballs hanging from
her coat. Initially when approached she was interested in inspectors but when nothing was offered, she went and laid in
front of the barrel. Through the remainder of the inspection she continued to lay outside of the occupied shelter.
The current size of the barrels for both the adult brown and adult black bears would necessitate these animals lying on top
of one another in order for all bears to access the shelter at the same time. Adult bears do not typically enter confined
spaces with other adult bears. The behavior of adult bears combined with the small shelter space provided is preventing
these animals from accessing the single shelter provided and leaving them exposed to the elements.
The two juvenile brown bears have two shelters provided – one metal barrel and one square plastic tank type shelter.

Only the metal barrel had bedding material (hay or straw). The smaller of the two juvenile brown bears is in poor body
condition. Although each animal can access a shelter, the poor condition of this animal makes it more susceptible to the
cold wet environmental conditions. The use of an inadequately insulated shelter has led to a state of unrelieved suffering
for this animal.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
The outdoor temperature at time of inspection was 26 degrees. The surface temperatures of the metal barrels ranged 22
to 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Metal that has not been insulated conducts body heat away from the animal creating an
unforgiving environment around the bears that is too cold for the current outdoor temperatures. The behavior of adult
bears is preventing these animals from sharing the single shelter provided. Correct by ensuring that appropriate shelter is
provided to all bears to alleviate the state of unrelieved suffering. Enough shelters and shelter space must be provided so
that all animals housed in the primary enclosure can access a shelter area at the same time to allow them to escape the
cold temperatures, and precipitation. Additionally, shelters constructed of all metal must be insulated and bedded
appropriately with clean dry bedding.

Feeding.
The licensee is offering donated grocery store meat to all bears. The licensee stated that he offered this meat the prior
evening, but the bears showed little interest. There was no meat or other food present in the enclosures during this
inspection. An all meat diet is not an appropriate diet for bears that have not eaten for a significant period of time. Leafy
greens or other vegetable matter is more appropriate for bears that have fasted. An all meat diet fed to bears that have
not been fed for a significant period of time can lead to illness or death.
One juvenile brown bear is in poor body condition, it has poor coat condition and appears unthrifty. This animal is

significantly smaller than the other juvenile it is currently housed with. The current condition of this animal indicates that it
has been in a poor nutritional state for considerable time. This is likely due to poor nutrition during the fall, not being fed
by the licensee while confined to the barrels, and/or competition from the other animal in its enclosure.
The food provided shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive
value to maintain all animals in good health. Animals shall be fed at least once a day except as dictated by hibernation,
veterinary treatment, normal fasts, or other professionally accepted practices.
The bears must be fed daily, or at a minimum when they awaken from hibernation/torpor to ensure they maintain an
appropriate body weight to sustain them through the winter, and to alleviate suffering. Correct by ensuring that
appropriate feed is on-hand and being offered to all animals at least daily since they are not in hibernation.

The primary enclosure housing two brown bear cubs has an area of fencing, which is used to prevent the bears from
digging out of the enclosure, that is exposed on the ground.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

The holes must be filled, or a different substrate used to ensure the bear cubs do not dig holes exposing the fencing
below. The bear cubs could catch their legs in this fencing causing injury.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
