3.28(c)(1)(iii) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
There was one guinea pig pen that did not provide the required amount of floor space. There were 138 weanling guinea
pigs housed in a pen that measured approximately 7,156 square inches of floor space. Each weanling requires a
minimum of 60 square inches of floor space. Total floor space required to house these weanlings is 8,280 square inches.
There cannot be more than 119 weanling guinea pigs housed in an enclosure measuring 7,156 square inches.
Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, and aggression in animals.
The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs are provided with the minimum amount of floor space in order to avoid
overcrowding and to support the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.
