FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***I observed the black bear "Annie" trying to climb up into her den on a ramp that has a steep slope. There are
crossbars or slats on the ramp to provide traction but I observed Annie having difficulty reaching for the crossbar
and slipping on the wet surface in between. Slipping on the surface may lead to injury. Because of "Annie's"
documented age and health concerns additional measures must be taken to provide for her safety and stability
when using he ramp.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The den provided for the arthritic and geriatric bear "Annie" is insufficient to provide adequate protection from the
cold. The den is raised and completely open to the weather on one side and no bedding is provided inside the den.
The temperature today is in the mid forties. The national forecast indicates the temperature will reach into the high
20's to low 30's at night for the remainder of the week. Excessive exposure to extreme cold for an older geriatric
and arthritic bear can cause discomfort and be detrimental to the bears health and well-being. An additional means
of obtaining warmth or protection from the cold must be made available to provide for her health and well-being as
well as protect her from discomfort.
***The cougar den is without any bedding for protection from the cold. The den is made of sheets of plywood raised
and completely open on one side. The structure does not provide protection from the wind on one side. The
cougar is geriatric and in a debilitated state of health and is severely underweight. Her condition will not protect her
from extended exposure to the cold so additional means of providing warmth in her den must be provided. A light
has been provided on the outside of the enclosure fence but it is several feet away from her den. I observed the
cougar coming down out of her den and rubbing herself along the fence in front of the lamp indicating she may be
attempting to obtain some warmth. A softer surface material shall be provided to protect the cougar from the
effects of the hard surface in her den to protect her from discomfort.

SANITATION. ***The chinchilla enclosure has an excessive accumulation of feces. There is feces in the food bowl that appears to
be drying. The bedding in the pan beneath the wire flooring has accumulated a lot of moisture as well as the feces
which attracts flies and insects as well as increases the possibility of exposing the chinchilla to additional disease
hazard. The enclosure shall be cleaned and maintained in a manner that will prevent contamination of the
chinchillas and their food to protect the health and well being of the chinchillas.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attendant at the facility and exit briefing conducted with
