Facilities, general.
Arena pen: Along the back side of this enclosure there were parts of old fencing material including wooden posts and
loose chicken wire hanging from the chain link enclosure fence. Also, there was an approximate 6ft fence panel with loose
wires and metal posts leaning against the enclosure fence and old, loosely piled chain link material on the ground next to
the panel. On the north side of the pen there were several sections of chain link enclosure fencing which were in disrepair
with bowed out areas along the bottom leaving openings/gaps of approximately 7 inches and loose wire.

Enclosure fencing in disrepair with gaps/openings and loose wires or fencing material within an enclosure may pose an
injury risk to the animals. Animals may become entangled in loose fencing material or get lacerations or other injuries
from wires. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals. A system of facility repair and maintenance must be in place to ensure the health and well-
being of the animals.
