Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Eight chinchillas had haircoats that were in poor condition. The haircoats were noticeably unkempt, oily, and matted. The
licensee stated these animals haven’t had access to dust baths for the last three to four weeks until a supply of dust can
be acquired. Providing appropriate dust baths for chinchillas is a standard method of preventing unkempt haircoats.
Ensure that all chinchillas have access to dust baths with an appropriate frequency to provide for their health and well-
being.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
We observed that the facility has been observing and identifying various health problems and treating them under the
recommendations of the attending veterinarian. However, we observed 5 animals that had problems that had not been
previously identified by the facility and accurately conveyed to the attending veterinarian for treatment instructions prior to
the inspection:
-An ebony-colored male had an unkempt wet hair coat, was missing a lower incisor, and had a small firm swelling on the
bridge of his nose.


-Female in 68A: right eye was swollen and sealed shut and her right ear had dried crusty material around it and pale
discharge inside the canal. When the licensee handled her it was seen a pale discharge was under her eyelids.
-Female in 92B: her lower incisors were excessively long and her hair coat was unkempt and appeared to be in a
generalized poor condition.
-Female in 44C: (eartag A41 SIRS); her left eye was swollen and sealed shut. It had discharge under the eyelids when
handled by the licensee.
-Female in 137C: had discharge and hair loss in her urogenital region. She was unkempt and appeared to be in a general
poor condition.

Improving daily observations will help animal health problems such as these to get promptly treated. Continue to improve
the routine of daily observations so that animal health problems can be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in an
accurate and timely manner.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
We observed the facility has replaced and repaired many enclosures and some feeders and the facility reports checking
enclosures weekly, however some remain in need of repair or replacing: At least 25 feeders were in disrepair during the
time of inspection. The feeders had rusted, sharp and rough edges exposed to the animals. The shared wire wall located
between enclosure 51C and 51D was in disrepair. A section of wire wall on the front of enclosure 147D was in disrepair.
The wire floor in an additional enclosure was in disrepair. Each of these enclosures contained wires that were missing,
broken, and bent which exposed sharp points to the animals.
Sharp metal points and rough edges could potentially injure the animals**.
Ensure that affected feeders are repaired or replaced and repair/replace the affected enclosures prior to using them


again.
**Note: The chinchillas in the enclosures with broken wires were moved by the licensee to different enclosure during the
time of inspection.
3.125(d)

Facilities, general.
The floor directly below the south row of enclosures had excessive excreta and soiled food waste. We observed this
along the entire row and found it was more concentrated in the back animal room. The licensee said that this row was
going to be cleaned before we showed up for inspection, however it was no longer being cleaned daily as in past
inspections when air quality was acceptable. The back room had excessive flies and poor air quality with a strong
ammonia odor. Both inspectors' throat and eyes were irritated from the ammonia odor while in this area of the building.
Excessive build-up of these materials produce odors, attract/reproduce flies, and create conditions that can make the
animals sick. Thoroughly remove waste from this area and remove waste often to minimize odors, fly reproduction and
disease hazards.
