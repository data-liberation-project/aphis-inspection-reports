ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* "(cid:28)Beckles", a five year old female Saint Bernard, (ID#: 0A02396226) had an open sore on the nose that was about
1 inch wide that was missing hair and skin. The sore was reddened and moist. There were a few areas of dark
crusty material within the sore.
* "(cid:28)Giggles", a four year old female Saint Bernard, (ID#: 0A02353415) was observed to have a large number of flies
on her nose about every minute during inspection. Her nose was missing hair, slightly moist, and reddened with
dark ring around the wound. This is a sign that the flies were starting to irritate it.
* "(cid:28)Freckles", a seven year old female Saint Bernard, (ID#: 0A02397928) had an open sore on top of the nose about
1/2 inch wide that was missing skin and hair. The sore was reddened and moist.
* (cid:28)"Gabby", a five year old female Collie, (ID#: 0A02352560), was missing hair at the tip of her left ear. This area
was approximately ½ inch wide at the widest point. There was hair loss on the back side of the right ear
approximately ¼ inch wide at the widest point. The skin was reddened and there was a dark crusty material on the
tip of both ears. The top of her nose had hair loss approximately ½ inch wide by 1 inch long. The skin on top of the
nose was pink. The licensee reported that this is what happens to the collies during fly season.
The licensee said that this happens every year during fly season and showed the treatment plan that they were
following. Open sores with hair loss for the above mentioned dogs can be due to allergies, injury, flies or other
medical conditions that could be painful and irritating.
** There is Ovitrol prescribed by the Attending Veterinarian to prevent flies from bothering the nose and ears of the
dogs. Due to the ongoing condition of the open sores, the licensee must have the above mentioned dogs
reevaluated by the Attending Veterinarian care to determine what has caused the open sores (diagnosis) and
develop a treatment plan for them. This is will provide guidance so that they can get healed up. Additionally, a
treatment plan for the open sores on the above mentioned dogs must prevent irritation by flies.
The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licenseemust ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
* The following medications were in the Main Kennel in a medication storage bucket:
1.(cid:9)One bottle of Calcium Gloconate 23% with an expiration date of Jan 2016.
2.(cid:9)One bottle of Albon 5% with no Expiration date.
3.(cid:9)One bottle of a yellow substance with no label.
These medications were be used. Medications used past their expiration date can lose their effectiveness and
affect the health of the animals. There is no know expiration date, instructions for usage and what is being used for
medications with no label. As a result, this medication is being used without certainty.
Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents of the
container can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that medications are not used
past their expiration dates. As part of the program of adequate veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all
medications are labeled with the contents (name and concentration of drug), dosing instructions (specific for the
species of animal being treated), and expiration date. The Licensee must ensure that appropriate methods of
veterinary care are used at all times. This will promote the health of 26 adult dogs and five puppies.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The chain link dividers between enclosures: one and two, and three and four, counting from the east for the main
kennel are fasten to the back wall with metal straps. The top metal straps for these two dividers were broken. The
panels are slightly leaning at the top. This could cause injury to the 11 Saint Bernards and Labrador Retrievers
housed in these enclosures, from the dogs leaning on the dividers causing them to fall.
For the prevention of injury and containment of the dogs, all housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair
at all times.

3.1(b)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Four bottles of medication were stored in a square bucket in the main kennel. The bucket did not have a lid and
there was an accumulation of gray to brown dust and debris on top of the bottles. This can soil or contaminate the
medication affecting the health of the dogs the medication is used for.
All medications must be stored in an area that is kept clean and in a manner that prevents an accumulation of dust
and debris on the bottles. This will prevent contamination and ensure the quality of the medications used on the 26
adult and five puppies.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The concrete flooring inside the main kennel had paint that is worn off exposing bare concrete. The surface of the
concrete is rough. This concrete surface is not impervious to moisture and cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized.
* Along the wood walls of the whelping room there were boards that are excessively chewed or scratched. The
paint is peeling off in these areas exposing bare wood.
The New Shed and Main Kennel had a wood board that runs along the bottom of the wall. This board had paint
peeling off exposing bare wood and is excessively scratched and chewed in areas. The wood dog door frames for
the New Shed have paint that was peeling off in areas exposing bare wood.
These above mentioned surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. Therefore, this can increase the
disease hazards for the 26 adult dogs and five puppies.

All surfaces must be maintain on a regular basis. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization, thus
minimizing the disease hazards.
