3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are several areas which were observed where there are holes under the perimeter fence that are either
caused by feral animals digging underneath &/or soil erosion. These holes are large enough to allow feral animals
to pass under the perimeter fence. Feral animals pose a risk of harm or disease to the zoo's collection and should
not gain access to the zoo grounds.
Failure to prevent wild animals from entering the facility can lead to the exposure to injuries, diseases or parasites,
and this can adversely affect the health and well-being of the regulated animals.
The perimeter fence shall be in good repair, and constructed and maintained so that it prevents unauthorized
persons and animals from going through it, and also must function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the zoo.
A regular inspection and maintenance program for the perimeter fence shall be established and maintained at all
times.
