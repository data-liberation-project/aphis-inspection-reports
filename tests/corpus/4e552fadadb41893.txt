FEEDING.
*** The feeder for the deer contained grass clippings that had appeared to been put in the feeder several months
ago. The grass clippings were old had a musty odor. When clumps were broken these were discolored grey to white
and released particles consistent with improper drying. Additionally there was an excessive accumulations of bird
feces on the surface of these grass clippings. Grass clippings fed in this manner are not appropriate feed material
and pose a risk to the health of the animals. In addition to the grain, the facility is feeding baked goods as treats,
these items with excessive sugar are also not appropriate to feed to the deer as they can potentially cause irritations
in the gut.
*** The facility has been in the process of transitioning to a primary diet of dog food for the bears. Due to illness of
the primary animal caretaker and lack of dog food, the facility brought out buckets of restaurant left over food
(donuts, muffins, pasta, breads, fries, and cooked meat products) to feed. These types of food are poor nutritive
value while containing excessive calories that contributes to the bear’s excessive weight. Obesity poses a
significant risk to the health of animals, therefore due to the current body condition of these animals, it is imperative
that a diet that is nutritious and of appropriate quantity is fed.
*** At the time of the inspection, raw chicken for the bobcat was being thawed in the food barn in a plastic pan on
the floor. There was a heater on the chicken to assist with the thawing process. The facility states that due to lack of
insulation the frozen chicken will not thaw in the refrigerator. The current method of thawing food in the winter does
not protect the meat from thawing in an uneven manner. Thawing in this type of uncontrolled manner increases the
chances of food spoilage and food borne illness. The manner of thawing food in the winter needs to be addressed
to maintain the nutritive value of the food and to assure the health of the animals.
*** The facility needs to create a diet plan for all species that meets the specific nutritive needs of the species. This
plan should detail specific daily diet amounts to maintain a healthy body condition of the animals. The plan should
be assessed by the attending veterinarian.

EMPLOYEES.
*** The current facility caretaker is considered part time and works 7 days a week. There is no back up animal care
employee who is able to feed or care for the animals if an emergency came up. Recently the animal caretaker was
ill and dry diet could not be ordered for the bears. In addition, the bear pen has not been cleaned in over a week
because there was no one who was trained to clean. The facility needs to assure that a sufficient number of
adequately trained employees are in place to maintain a professional level of husbandry and care.
