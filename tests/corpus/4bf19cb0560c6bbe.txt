ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was a male Poodle (051*832*613) with matted fur and a heavy amount of clear discharge from the right
eye. Also, the fur in the corner and under both eyes was discolored reddish-brown and wet. Portions of the skin
were visible through the wetted hair. The dog had recently been groomed; however, there were focal areas of
matted fur on top of the dog's rear feet, in the abdominal/inguinal region and surrounding the scrotum. There was a
thick, yellowish-green, moist material noted on the fur in the dog's abdominal/inguinal region. On the dog's scrotum
there was an approximately 1/4 inch reddened lesion which may have resulted from the grooming, according to the
licensee.
***There was a male Maltese (109*838*262) with a large amount of dark brown to black material noted in the left
ear. This dark brown to black material was at the opening to the canal as well as in the fur surrounding the inside of
the ear. The dog also had some mats present at the corner of the right eye.
Eye discharge could be the result of infection, allergies, injury and/or other veterinary medical conditions. The ear
discharge could be the result of an infection or other veterinary medical condition that may cause discomfort.
Matting can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of skin sores.
The licensee must consult with a veterinarian regarding the conditions of these animals in order to obtain accurate
diagnoses and to ensure that appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must ensure
these dogs are groomed and must establish an appropriate grooming schedule for all dogs.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
