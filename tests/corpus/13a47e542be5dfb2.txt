ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Of the six adult goats, two were noticed limping on their right forelegs. When the caretaker was asked, he stated
two of the goats were attacked by a pit bull dog in Georgia a week ago. The caretakers have been treating the
wounds with a salve, but they were not examined by a veterinarian at the time of the attack, or since. The goats are
obviously in pain as they are both limping on their right forelegs and are occasionally non-weight bearing. These
goats need to be seen by a veterinarian for a diagnosis and treatment. To be corrected by 4-1-15.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The caretaker provided the paperwork he was given by the owner for traveling. It does not include acquisition
records for the camel and 11 goats. There are currently 6 adult goats and 5 babies, including two born a day ago.
The faxed itinerary stated there were 7 goats, including two babies, but did not indicate when those babies were
born. The records must be present to reflect the current inventory of animals, including the species and sex, date of
acquistion, and name, address, drivers license, and license plate number of the person from whom animals were
purchased or otherwise acquired. An inventory sheet was once again provided the caretaker and record keeping
explained.
2.131(c)(1) DIRECT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During this inspection, the six adult goats were tethered on dog leashes with the handles slipped over 2 foot stakes.
The goats are located behind the transport and living trailers adjacent to the grass field parking area. There are
only two adult caretakers, and between the circus performances, camel rides were given. The load platform for the
camel rides is on the opposite side of the camels, so the goats were only being observed by the man leading the
camel as he circled the trailers. At one time over 15 people including children of all sizes were gathered around the
adult and baby goats. Children were sitting or kneeling beside the adult goats and the baby goats were observed
being picked up by the adults and the children. Although no rough handling was observed, there was no
supervision to assure the safety of the animals and the public. All of the goats have horns. It would have been easy
for someone to walk away with any of the goats, leading them on the leashes, or holding the baby goats. There isa sign on the fence near the camel to not touch the animals, but lack of adequate barriers is keeping this from
happening. To be corrected by 4-1-15.
3.125(a) DIRECT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
When animals in traveling exhibits are taken off the transport enclosures, they need to be contained in enclosures
which protect the animals from injury and contain the animals. During this travel inspection, the goats were found
individually tied by a dog leash and collar to a 2 foot ground stake. The 5 baby goats are loose in the area. The
easy attack of a loose dog last week injuring two of the goats shows this "set up" is not safe for the animals. Being
tethered does not protect them from predators and does not keep the public out unless supervised. It could also
lead to entanglement as they run around the stake, or lead to their escape if the tether slips over the top of the
stake.
To be corrected by 4-3-15.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
After being unloaded, the camel is not contained in an enclosure, but is also tied to the trailer almost continuously
as it can pull up a stake. Although it can cush, it cannot turn around. An enclosure needs to be provided the camel
once it is unloaded, so that it can make normal postural adjustments such as turning around, laying down, and the
ability to move a few steps, something it cannot do now. To be corrected by 4-3-15.
3.137(c)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The ceiling of the animal transport trailer is approximately 6.5 feet tall. The camel is at least six feet tall at his hump.
He is being transported in this trailer where he cannot make normal postural adjustments by lifting his head into a
normal position. This animal needs to be transported in an enclosure which allows him to hold his head up
normally.
To be corrected by 5-1-15.
