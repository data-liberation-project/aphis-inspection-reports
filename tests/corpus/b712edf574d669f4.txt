2.31(e)(2) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
**Two IACUC protocols (99014-113 and 96515-01) did not have adequate rationales for the numbers of animals to
be used. For protocol 99014-113, the rationale states that "the total number of animals is the minimum needed to
properly characterize the effects of a high sugar high fat (HSHF) diet on various aspects of the metabolic syndrome
in cynomolgus macaques and thus to meet the experimental objectives". The total number of animals to be used in
year one is 60. There is no explanation in the protocol how these numbers were determined.
**In protocol 96515-01, the rationale for number of animals states "this is a pilot screening study to evaluate the
response at three points on an estimated lethality profile. This study will be used to inform doses for a larger study".
The total animals to be used will be 48. Neither protocol provides an explanation as to how these numbers were
derived.
The IACUC must ensure that all proposals to conduct an activity involving animals have an adequate rationale that
explains why these numbers are necessary in order to ensure that the minimum number of animals are utilized.
IACUC approval of activities where an adequate rationale for numbers has not been provided could result in
unnecessary animal use.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
During a recent 4 month period, 6 macaques died as a result of internal bleeding subsequent to having an
ultrasound
guided liver biopsy, 4 deaths having occurred in March 2016. While reviewing records it was noted there were
concerns regarding proficiency of staff with the procedure. The research facility must provide adequate training and
staffing to ensure proper use of the animals in order to prevent a serious animal welfare issue. Failure to provide
adequate training and personnel can have a negative impact on animal welfare.The facility identified the incidents and implemented corrective actions to further prevent this type of incident from
reoccurring including a revision of the ultrasound guided biopsy procedure and retraining of staff.
Correction: Ensure corrective actions are properly followed.
A team inspection was conducted on May 4 - 5, 2016.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representatives, Dr. Dawn Barksdale, VMO and Dr. Diane Forbes,
VMO.
