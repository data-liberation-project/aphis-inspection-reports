2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility is not keeping complete or accurate records of acquisitions or dispositions for the animals. Current
records of animals on hand lists 14 rabbits, 1 chinchilla, 9 sugar glides, 5 hedgehogs and 2 ferrets. Physical
inventory of what was in the facility at the time of inspection was 5 rabbits, 0 chinchilla, 0 sugar gliders, 3
hedgehogs and 1 ferret. Most of the entries on the current records of animals on hand were missing name, address
and USDA license number. Several of the disposition records did not include the name and address of the person
to whom an animal was sold. Maintaining current records of animals on hand, including those acquired and
disposed of, is required in order to be able to accurately track the movement of animals. Make, keep, and maintain
records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding the acquisition and disposition of
animals other than dogs and cats.
