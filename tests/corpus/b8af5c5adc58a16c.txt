inch high (2.5 cm). This is important to ensure the proper handling and safety of the dogs during transport.
3.15(f)(2)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
On 4/27/22 the airline transported 4 French Bulldog puppies (DOB of each puppy was 11/5/21 or 5 months and 22 days of
age) in 2 crates on AWB 074-52889513 (each crate contained 2 puppies). Two of the puppies were dead on arrival.
There was one dead puppy in each crate; the veterinary pathologist who examined the dead puppies determined that the
cause of death of each puppy was Brachycephalic airway syndrome. The weights obtained by personnel at the ARK at
JFK for the 2 deceased puppies were: male microchip #953000010602729 weighed 24 lbs and female microchip
#953000010602731 weighed 22 lbs. No more than one puppy between 8 weeks and 6 months of age that weighs over


20 lbs may be transported in the same crate when transported by air.

Per this Section, any person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations must not transport a dog or cat by air unless the
following requirements are met: No more than one live puppy, 8 weeks to 6 months of age, and weighing over 20 lbs (9
kg), may be transported in a primary enclosure when shipped via air carrier. This is important to ensure that the dog has
sufficient space during transport to move about and to ensure the safety and comfort of the animal.
3.17(c)

Food and water requirements.
On 4/27/22 the airline transported 4 French Bulldog puppies in 2 crates on AWB 074-52889513. One of the crates had a
single receptacle attached inside the crate. Each crate should have a receptacle for food and a second receptacle for
water attached inside the transport crate.

Per this Section, food and water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that
the receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosure without opening the door. Food and water receptacles must be
available on the crates to comply with the food and water requirements for dogs during transport.

An exit briefing was attempted multiple times via phone and emails to facility representatives.
