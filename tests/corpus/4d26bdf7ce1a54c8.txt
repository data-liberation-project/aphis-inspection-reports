ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1437 on
31-Aug-17. I went to the licensee's house. A representative came out and said that the licensee was out working in
the farm field and would be away for at least an hour. She was not comfortable taking me through to do the
inspection. I informed her I would try back another time.
End of report.
