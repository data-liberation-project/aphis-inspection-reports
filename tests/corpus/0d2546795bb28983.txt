ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(3) Veterinary care: The following were observed during the inspection:
1) One light tan and white female Syrian hamster had a chewed left ear with a thick scab. She was housed with
another female hamster and a male hamster. Once APHIS officials identified the hamster with the chewed ear, a
facility employee moved the hamster to its own enclosure.
2) There were two enclosures each housing two live Syrian hamsters and one partial eaten dead hamster with a
strong odor of decomposition. Once APHIS officials identified the dead hamsters, a facility employee removed the
dead hamsters from the enclosures.
All animals must be observed daily to access their health and well-being so that problems with animal health can be
addressed by the attending veterinarian and incompatible animals can be separated in a timely manner. Correct by
performing effective daily observations of all animals so problems are identified and appropriate care is provided as
direct by the attending veterinarian. Correct from this day forward.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Section 2.75(b)(1): Records: A current record of animals on hand was not available for review during this inspection.
The last facility inventory provided to the APHIS officials was dated September 8, 2016 and did not include guinea
pigs and rabbits. Records are required in order to adequately verify the total number of animals housed at the
facility and for evaluating the facility animal care program. Correct by ensuring there are current records for animal
totals, including births and deaths, maintained and available for review for all the animal species housed at the
facility. Correct by December 8, 2016.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.Section 3.31(a)(1) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures: An enclosure with 9 weaned guinea pigs and two
enclosures each with 5 adult guinea pigs were excessively dirty. More fecal material was visible than bedding
material. Animals standing and laying in fecal material are potentially exposed to bacteria and parasites. Correct
by cleaning the enclosures often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta. Correct by December 2, 2016.
3.31(a)(3)
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(3) Cleaning and sanitization of primary enclosures: There was a buildup of tan to brown roughened
scale and debris on the bottom of the enclosures, along the lower edge of the sides and corners of enclosures that
facility employees were putting in clean bedding to house guinea pigs that arrived at the facility earlier in the
morning. The facility president informed the APHIS officials that these enclosures had been cleaned and sanitized.
The cleaning process does not seem effective in removing this buildup and these enclosures cannot be properly
sanitized. Housing guinea pigs in dirty and used enclosures exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such
as bacterial, fungal and viral diseases. Correct by ensuring that the enclosures are effectively cleaned and
sanitized to remove scale and debris prior to the introduction of guinea pigs into previously occupied enclosures.
Correct by December 15, 2016.
3.36(d)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
Section 3.36(d): There were 11 transport enclosures containing a total of 238 guinea pigs that arrived at the facility
by a facility employee in the morning. The transport enclosures contained an average of 21-22 guinea pigs in each
enclosure. No more than 15 live guinea pigs can be transported in the same enclosure to prevent stress and
discomfort to the animals. Correct by ensuring that no more than 15 guinea pigs are transported in a primary
enclosure. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility president.
