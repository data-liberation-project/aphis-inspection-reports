Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
**The brown alpaca’s left eye still had thick, white discharge, and was not holding the eye fully open. This is a sign of eye
pain. This animal still has not seen a vet nor was his condition communicated to a veterinarian for further guidance,
diagnosis, and possible treatment.

** The bobcat was still limping on his right rear leg and was more hesitant to move around about the enclosure. This is a
sign of pain. The condition of the animal still has not been communicated to the veterinarian for guidance.

*** The spiny mouse that was observed with a 1/2 by 1/3 inch open wound on the right hind leg, and was non weight
bearing, was still housed with other spiny mice and had not been observed or treated and the condition still has not been
communicated to a veterinarian for guidance in treatment. At the time of the inspection, this animal was separated and
then treated by the licensee with ivermectin without veterinarian guidance.

*** A second spiny mouse in the adjacent enclosure has an injury on the tail with blood evident. Despite this injury, it had
not been observed by the facility despite the current cleaning occurring in that area.


** A degu with a visible injury to the back right above his tail was also identified by the inspector. Hair is missing with an
open wound and blood on the skin and down the tail. This enclosure had also recently been cleaned and this was not
observed by the facility representative so no communication to a veterinarian had been done. At the time of the
inspection, this animal was separated and then treated by the licensee with ivermectin without veterinarian guidance.

The licensee must ensure that the daily observation of all animals, and that a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication is in place so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health is conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.

Space requirements.
*** The facility has degus and spiny mice housed in enclosures that do not provide the animals the ability to get away from
more aggressive or dominant animals. There are no visual barriers, no method to engage in exercise and both species of
animals have tail injuries, foot injury, and one degu has a wound to his back. There was also dried blood on the glass of
the enclosures to both species. Injuries and fighting are an indicator of inadequate space which become difficult to see
with so many animals housed together. These animals were in the process of being cleaned during the inspection, and
yet these wounds and injuries were not observed by the facility staff. These animals need to be provided more space for
their welfare.
