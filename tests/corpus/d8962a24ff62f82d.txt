2.40(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One of the tigers (14 year old) appears to be underweight. The hip bones and shoulder blades appear prominent
with diminished muscle mass over these areas. The abdominal area also appeared to be tucked in. The facility is
unable to weigh this animal to determine if there is a continual weight loss &/or loss of body muscle mass. The last
blood work and physical exam was performed on August 2013 at which time this animal appeared normal. The
veterinarian has increased the amount of food to be given to this animal, but this does not appear to resolve or
stabilize this issue as there are no weights being performed.
In order to diagnose an underlying cause or disease, appropriate physical exam, blood work, & specialized test(s) ,
etc must be conducted so that a treatment plan can be implemented.
Suture material (4 packs), Heparin vials (18), Xylazine vials (2) were expired. Expired medications and/or material
are not considered appropriate for the treatment of animals.
To be corrected by 1-30-2015.
3.75(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The olive baboon enclosure wire mesh was broken in (at least) two different places which could lead to the animals
getting through these openings and escaping from their enclosure.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the
animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.
To be corrected by 2-28-2015.
3.80(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The wire mesh covering the drain pipe in the dry moat in the chimpanzee enclosure continues to have deteriorated
leaving jagged edges. The ends of the metal hose clamps holding the PVC pipe which surrounds the suspended
cables also continues to have sharp edges. No corrections have taken place since the last inspection. Theseprimates can & do have contact with these surfaces.
All surfaces shall be free of points and edges which can potentially injure the primates.
3.84(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The chimpanzee exhibit was observed to again have black and green algae on the floor, empty concrete pool, and
back wall. Large accumulations of dirt and leaves were in the dry moat and dirt/algae continue to be observed inside
of the empty small concrete pool. There were hay and dry leaves scattered on the floor of the exhibit which
appeared to be in the enclosure for a couple of days. These observances indicates that these areas are either either
not properly or regularly cleaned.
The algae, hay and leaves on the floors can become slippery which can cause injury to the primates, and does not
allow for a thorough and complete cleaning. Housing facilities must be cleaned when necessary to satisfy generally
accepted husbandry standards and practices in order to protect the health of the primates.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Food was stored inside the cooler directly under a sign that says do not put food under this area. There is a
drainage pipe under the cooler pan in this area which creates condensate and water drips on top of the food
causing contamination of the food.
Food shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or
contamination. Employees shall follow all signage to ensure that the food is adequately protected.
To be corrected by 1-15-2015.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The skylights in the tiger & lion shelters had large accumulations of cobwebs, dirt, and leaves hanging indicative
that these areas not being cleaned frequently &/or with regularity. The plastic lens covers for the lights in the
commissary continue to be cracked and had dead flies in them. These covers now have hole which were directly
above the food preparation table which potentially would allow these flies to fall into the food below. The shelter
area of the camels/sheep & sable antelope had large accumulations of spider webs and dirty floors, also indicating
that these areas had not been properly &/or frequently cleaned. The cougar exhibit had a strong smell of urine that
was noticeable from approx 10 feet from their enclosure.
Millipede worms, a dead cockroach and dirt was observed in the floor of the commissary. Excessive dust wasobserved on the top of the commissary cabinets. A box of nails was observed inside the hay storage container
which further indicates that areas are not being properly cleaned &/or maintained.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this
subpart..
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
It appears that during holidays the numbers and hours worked by the employees is reduced which has an impact in
husbandry practices in several areas as evidenced by the housekeeping and cleaning NCI's during this inspection.
An adequate number of trained employees shall be available daily, including holidays, to facilitate the prescribe
husbandry practices for the health and welfare of all animals.
To be corrected by 2-28-2015.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
