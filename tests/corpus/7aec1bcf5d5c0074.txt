Contingency planning.
On the inspection conducted September 13, 2022, the licensee did not have a written or otherwise documented
contingency plan available for inspection.

A contingency plan must be available on inspection to insure that a plan has been thought out and would be implemented
in case of vehicle mechanical/power breakdown, accidents, animal escapes, or natural disasters most likely to be
experienced. This planning and implementation helps to minimize the number of adverse effects on the health and well-
being of animals in an emergency event or disaster.

Dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to
provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the event of an
emergency or disaster.

Correct by September 30, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
