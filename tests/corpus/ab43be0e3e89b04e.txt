2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A black and white Fainting Goat had hair loss covering a good portion of its body. The hair loss was observed on
the back and sides of the head, the sides of the legs, and the inner parts of the back legs. The goat was noted to
have flaky skin, especially in the areas of the hair loss. The licensee has not consulted with or had this condition
treated by the Attending Veterinarian. Hair loss indicates there may be an underlying health issue. It can be
irritable to the animal and it could potentially be contagious to other animals or even people. The Attending
Veterinarian must be consulted with and the goat must be treated per his or her instructions. Correct by 6/3/16.
3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two rabbit enclosures (each holding a rabbit) had holes in the wire flooring of the enclosures that were large
enough for the rabbit to fall through. Holes in the enclosures could allow for the rabbits to escape or for a wild
animal to get into the enclosure. In addition, the rabbits could get injured if they fall through the holes. Primary
enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury, contain them,
and to keep predators out. Correct by 6/8/16.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the small animal room, there was a hedgehog enclosure (had 1 hedgehog) on top of the degu enclosure (had 2
degus). There was no tray in between the enclosures or anything to prevent feces or urine from the hedgehog
enclosure from falling into the degu enclosure. This in unsanitary and could easily allow for the spread of disease
from the hedgehog enclosure to the degu enclosure. Provisions shall be made for the removal and disposal of
animal and food wastes in the hedgehog enclosure. Correct immediately.
3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
An overwhelming odor was observed when walking into the small animal room (size of a small bedroom). Therewere over 16 animals in the room comprising over 11 species. I was not able to determine exactly where the odor
was coming from. A strong odor may indicate the room is not properly ventilated. Not having a properly ventilated
room may allow for disease to easily spread from animal to animal. In addition, a room that isn't properly ventilated
could be an added stress to the upper respiratory systems of the animals in the room. Indoor housing facilities shall
be adequately ventilated by natural or mechanical means to provide for the health and to prevent discomfort of the
animals at all times. Correct by 6/8/16.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
