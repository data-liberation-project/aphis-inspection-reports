Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
In row A4, cage 20, there was a female white New Zealand rabbit that was stumbling around the cage. Upon further
exam, she had large, deep sores to the toes and bottom sides of both back feet with reddened tissue exposed. The
rabbit's condition had not been observed nor treated. Unobserved injuries and illnesses can cause pain and distress and
can progress to become serious conditions when left untreated. Animals must be observed daily and their health
concerns communicated as frequently as necessary with the attending veterinarian. Correct by seeking veterinary care by
10/19/22.

In row A1, cage 26, a male white New Zealand rabbit was standing very stiffly and continually shifting his weight off of
each of his feet. Upon closer exam, he had large sores on all 4 feet. His condition had not been observed nor treated.
Unobserved injuries and illnesses can cause pain and distress and can progress to become serious conditions when left
untreated. Animals must be observed daily and their health concerns communicated as frequently as necessary with the
attending veterinarian. Corrected at the time of inspection.
