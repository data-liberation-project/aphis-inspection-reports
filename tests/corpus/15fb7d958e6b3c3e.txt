Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The last two reports to the Institutional Official were not signed. Semi annual reports ensure both adequate oversight by
the IACUC of the animal care and use program, and that the Institutional Official is fully informed of any issues impacting
the institution. Semiannual reports must be reviewed and signed by a majority of IACUC members.

Correct by the next semiannual report from the IACUC to the Institutional Official.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
