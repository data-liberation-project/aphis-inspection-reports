SANITATION.
There was a moderate accumulation of rodent feces on the floor and next to the food containers inside a food
storage shed. A few holes at the bottom of a wall were discovered near the feces accumulation and appear to be a
possible source of entry. Additionally, there was a small hole in the ground on the outside of this building in the
same location. The licensee indicated there is no program in place to address rodents at this time.
Pests and vermin may contaminate food as well as harbor and spread diseases. A safe and effective pest control
program must be established and maintained to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
