grooming must be performed.

***One red and white female Japanese Chin (Dizzy, #016698080) had skin lesions running from under her chin,
ventral chest and abdomen. The area was hairless and the skin was reddened and has many small scabs. Although
the dog does not appear to be in discomfort, some type of medical problem is occurring. The licensee must have
the dog examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The licensee
must document the follow-up care as directed by the veterinarian and ensure that all animals receive veterinary care
when needed.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The regulation states, "Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs or cats must contain a roof, four sides and a floor, and
must:... (4) Contain clean, dry bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F (10 degrees C).
Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees F (1.7 degrees C) or lower."
***Several of the dens for the dogs did not have any bedding. The temperature the day of inspection was 30
degrees F. All outdoor dens must have some type of bedding added when the temperature is below 50 so that they
can maintain their body temperature and not be stressed by the cold.
