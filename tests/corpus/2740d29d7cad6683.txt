3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two shelters in separate enclosures were in disrepair during inspection. An enclosure containing two cougars had
a shelter with a roof that was torn up on the top. The shelter had wooden pieces with sharp points sticking up off
the top of the roof. Another shelter in a wolf enclosure had caved into the ground. The wolves had dug tunnels
underneath the shelter which caused the shelter to fall into the tunnel. The shelter was crooked and the roof of the
shelter had become displaced causing there to be an opening at the top and potentially exposing the inside of the
shelter to the elements of the weather. Sharp points on the top of the shelter could cause injury to the animals that
are walking across or laying on the top of the shelter. The roof of the shelter becoming displaced doesn't
adequately protect the animals within the shelter from the elements of the weather. The shelters must be
maintained to protect the animals from injury and from the elements of the weather.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
