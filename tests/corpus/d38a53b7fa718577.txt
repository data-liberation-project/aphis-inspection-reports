CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
Section 3.13(c) Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers: During the inspection the owners described
their transporting procedures to the APHIS official. They said they do not have the consignor certify in writing that
the dog was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery and do not obtain written instructions for the
in-transit food and water requirements for a 24 hour period, they get the instructions verbally. Written instructions
are required so there will be fewer misunderstanding or mistakes that may cause harm to the animals. Carriers are
required to have written certification that must include the following information for each dog or cat:
(1) The consignor's name and address;
(2) The tag number or tattoo assigned to each dog or cat under Sec. Sec. 2.38 and 2.50 of this chapter;
(3) The time and date the animal was last fed and watered and the specific instructions for the next feeding(s)
and watering(s) for a 24-hour period; and
(4) The consignor's signature and the date and time the certification was signed.
