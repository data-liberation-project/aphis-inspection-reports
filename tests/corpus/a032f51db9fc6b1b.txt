2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility had recognized some animals in need of veterinary care and was treating them, however these animals
had not been treated and were pointed out to the licensee during the inspection:
A black male chinchilla (no ID) had a hairless, reddened swollen area under its chin. This is a sign of an active
disease process and could be serious for the health of this chinchilla if not treated.
A baby chinchilla that was recently found by the licensee out of its enclosure was fostered onto a mother presumed
to be gentle by the licensee. Towards the end of the inspection it was noticed by an inspector to have a deep fresh
wound on its back left leg. The licensee was instructed that this needed to be seen today (8/28) by the veterinarian
as it had some toes just hanging on and we offered to end the inspection so veterinary care could be sought. The
licensee contacted the veterinarian and was able to schedule its visit within the hour.
A female chinchilla (DJM 136) had some matted hair around its collar. The licensee removed the collar and we
noted that there was firmly crusted hair and skin in the area where the collar was and there was either pale flesh or
pale discharge present where the collar was in contact with the neck and a putrid odor was noticeable.
A female chinchilla (GROS 248) had an area of pale and discolored flesh exposed (no skin present) on its left front
leg. The area started at the mid section of the leg (forearm), completely encircled the upper leg and extended up to
the chinchilla's mid-chest. The area was missing skin, was crusted on the front, and had an area of flaky white
discharge around the chest area.
These Direct non-compliances are serious and in their untreated state lead to prolonged pain and discomfort to the
affected chinchillas. The facility must ensure that the veterinarian promptly evaluates these animals and that the
prescribed treatment plan is followed.
**Note: The licensee took these three animals to the veterinarian prior to the end of the day.
Indirect non-compliances:
A female silver chinchilla (GROS 180) had skin swollen around the collar. The licensee removed the collar. An areaof redness and eroded skin was found where the collar had been.
A female white chinchilla (GROS 435) had a scab on top of its head and its left front foot was injured. The licensee
said that this one had gotten bit by a male and that some iodine was put on the head wound. The leg wound was
pointed out to the licensee during inspection.
A male silver/black chinchilla's (RVDK 136) right eye was swollen shut and when the licensee handled the eyelids
some pale discharge came out from under the eyelids.
These direct non-compliances, if left untreated could get worse and cause the animal unnecessary pain/discomfort
and if contagious could spread to other animals in the facility. The facility must have these animals evaluated by the
attending veterinarian and follow the prescribed treatment plan.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Per the licensee, standard operating procedure at the facility is to treat animals if a problem is discovered. The
facility had recognized some animals in need of veterinary care and was treating them, however several animals
were discovered by inspectors during inspection of needing veterinary care and were taken to the veterinarian:
-Black male chinchilla (no ID) had a hairless swollen area on its neck made aware to the licensee.
-Female chinchilla (DJM 136) had some matted hair around its collar and the condition of the embedded collar was
made aware to the licensee during inspection.
-Female chinchilla (GROS 248)'s leg problem of exposed flesh with flaky pale discharge was pointed out to the
licensee during the inspection.
Adequate daily observations are needed so that prompt veterinary evaluation can be completed and animals can
receive the needed prescribed veterinary care to resolve the medical conditions before they worsen.
3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility had some enclosures with holes that they marked for repair and had no animals in prior to inspection.
One enclosure containing one chinchilla had a hole in it with sharp points protruding into the enclosure. The
chinchilla was observed passing between the two enclosures through the hole. The licensee moved the chinchilla
to an enclosure without holes during inspection.
Another enclosure had a mom and two baby chinchillas contained within it. One of the baby chinchillas had a fresh
injury to its left rear foot. The licensee commented that the baby chinchilla was previously found on the floorbeneath the enclosures and it wasn't clear which chinchilla was the mother so the licensee placed it in with a mom
with a single chinchilla with the hopes that she would be a good foster dam. The wound appeared consistent with a
bite wound (due to foster dam's rejection of the chinchilla) as there were no sharp points in the enclosure found to
explain the fresh injury.
Holes with sharp points can result in the chinchillas' injury. Enclosures that don't maintain baby chinchillas with
their mothers can lead to serious effects to the newborns including injury (from falling), malnutrition to starvation,
and the preventable situation of having to foster lost/fallen baby chinchillas to mothers which creates the risk of
foster rejection as seen during inspection.
Enclosures must be maintained in good repair to prevent animal injury and escape.
Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
