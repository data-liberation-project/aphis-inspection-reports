FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The plastic structure in the enclosure housing 8 Jacob sheep that serves as a shelter has been torn down by the
sheep. There are trees in the enclosure that provide protection from the sunlight. However, there is currently no
shelter for the sheep to protect them from inclement weather. Lack of shelter from inclement weather can cause
discomfort to the sheep and does not provide protection from the elements. A shelter must be provided for the
sheep to protect them from inclement weather.
