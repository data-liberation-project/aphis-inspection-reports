There is an accumulation of trash that consists of old food packaging from chicken and other trash debris located
inside of a trash burn pit. The burn pit does not have a lid to cover the trash to prevent vermin infestation. During
the inspection, the inspector saw an excessive amount of flies swarming around and inside of the trash burn pit.
The trash burn pit is located 20 to 30 feet from the animal enclosures. Improper waste disposal can attract pests,
cause odors and diseases. The licensee should ensure proper waste disposal of trash and food products so as to
