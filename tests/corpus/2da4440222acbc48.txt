RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The Animals on Hand records (7005) that list the inventory animals of the facility have numerous errors with a mix
up of the ID number for each animal. There are several puppy records and Disposition(7006) records that have the
wrong ID numbers for the puppies sold that do not match with the number on the puppy record. There are some
dates, address and commercial shipper information that was missing on several Disposition forms. While there is
paperwork available and being kept, there are several errors that result in miss-identification of the regulated
animals in the documentation.
Complete and accurate records are required for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
The licensee must keep accurate records with all ID numbers for puppies and breeding stock correct on all
paperwork for the Inventory(7005), Disposition(7006) and puppy records. All required sections of the 7006 forms
shall be completed correctly.
