3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are trees that are too close to the fences in enclosures #9, #15, #17, #18 and #19a that could still provide an
opportunity for an animal to escape. It should be noted that on enclosure 19a a 4ft panel was added to increase the
height of this enclosure to 16ft, and some metal was put around a tree near the front. However a few trees near the
fence along the sides were still too close and touching or leaning against the top of the fence. A 2ft kick-in was
added around the front of the enclosure #18, however there are still a few trees on the right and left side of the
enclosure that are too close to the fence.
The facility needs to remove any trees that are too close to the primary enclosure fences. If the trees are not going
to be removed, an adequate kick-in over the top of the tree and/or around it that prevents the animals from climbing
the tree to escape must be added or another method must be devised by the facility to effectively prevent the
animals from using these trees for the purpose of escape. Taking these preventative measures and maintaining the
enclosure fence according to AWA regulations and standards should decrease the risk of escape by the regulated
animals that can climb and decrease the potential for safety risks to the animal and general public. While several
trees are identified during the inspection that need to be addressed in the above mentioned manner, it is ultimately
up to the licensee to identify all trees or substrates that could qualify as being a possible point of escape by
providing a purchase point or climbing surface out of the enclosure.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
There are five tiger and lion enclosures that had plastic enrichment barrels that have been chewed and destroyed to
the point where the plastic pieces could be chewed apart and possibly ingested by the cats. While the barrels are
good for enrichment, once they are chewed to the point where strips of plastic are hanging off or being chewed into
small pieces, the barrel should be removed to prevent ingestion of the small pieces of plastic.
The ingestion of small pieces of plastic can cause possible medical problems including blockages, lacerations ormouth injuries.
The licensee must remove any plastic enrichment barrels or balls or other toys that become severely chewed and
destroyed resulting in small pieces being available for ingestion.
To be corrected by: The barrels in the 5 enclosures were removed by the end of the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee and Dr. Susan Kingston, VMO. The licensee refused to sign
the inspection report upon advice of their lawyers. The report was left with the licensee and a copy was sent via
certified mail.
