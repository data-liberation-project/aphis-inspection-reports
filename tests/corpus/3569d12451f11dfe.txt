3.101(a)(3)

Facilities, general.
The marine mammal exhibit housing fur seals and sea lions has 3 large concrete columns in the animal-accessible area.
On the column closest to the public viewing window, the concrete surface has degraded and exposed rusted metal
surfaces can be seen close to the enclosure floor. Rust staining is evident extending toward the deck from the degraded
areas, and the lowest area of rust staining extends down to the floor.

In the same exhibit, there are light fixtures suspended at the top of these 3 concrete columns. These light fixtures, as well
as a painted metal horizontal beam affixed to one column, all hang over animal accessible areas, and in some instances
directly over the pool. These painted light fixtures show large geographic areas of paint loss, exposing rusted metal
surfaces underneath. Large, loose flakes of paint can be seen on some light fixtures that hang over the pool and on the
end of the metal beam that hangs over the enclosure floor. Facility staff state that paint flakes have been observed in the
water housing the animals and required removal.

Rust and paint flakes from inadequately maintained surfaces have contaminated animal accessible areas of the exhibit.
The degraded concrete surface is not able to be effectively cleaned, and the exposed rust and paint flakes in the exhibit


may present a health hazard via direct contact with animals or if ingested. All surfaces in a primary enclosure must be
maintained in good repair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program.

To be corrected by January 1st, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.
