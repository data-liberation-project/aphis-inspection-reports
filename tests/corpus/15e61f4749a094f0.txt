FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The Hyena enclosure has several places where cattle panels buried in the ground have been dug up, leaving
corners and ends exposed on the top of the ground. The shelter also has an exposed panel with a large hole
underneath, creating a raised floor with holes in it that require the hyena balance on the wire when in the shelter.
Exposed wire panels are a potential source of injury and/or discomfort to the enclosed animal. This area needs to
be maintained so that the animal has a safe, effective shelter for protection from the elements and weather. This
enclosure needs to be maintained structurally sound in good repair to protect the enclosed animal from injury. All
exposed cattle panels need to be adequately covered, and the shelter floor needs to be safe and solid.
- A wire panel fence serving as a public barrier around the perimeter of the hyena enclosure is secured to large
wooden posts. On at least one post, several portions of the fence are not physically connected to the post resulting
in a large gap at the top of the post. This is not an adequate barrier, and needs to be repaired to ensure the safety
of park visitors and the enclosed animal.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Multiple animals are being housed in the petting zoo barn during cold weather. The only source of artificial light
inside the barn is a single heat lamp. Animals housed indoors require lighting of sufficient quality, distributed in an
even manner, to protect the health and welfare of the enclosed species. The lighting must also be sufficient to allow
routine inspection and maintain adequate husbandry standards. Additional artificial light must be added as
necessary to meet the needs of the enclosed animals.

SANITATION.
Two enclosures housing servals had an excessive accumulation of feces. Much of the fecal material was dry andwhite, indicating that it had been present for some time. Waste accumulation increases contamination to the
enclosed animals. Fecal material must be removed as often as necessary to keep the enclosures clean, and to
protect the health and well being of the enclosed animals.
