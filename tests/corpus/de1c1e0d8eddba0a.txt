2.38(f) REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
A mini-pig, identification #1681, was found to have a fractured right hind limb following a procedure on 8/20/2014.
During the procedure, this pig repeatedly pulled its right hind limb into the restraint device (an elevated fabric sling)
which required repositioning of the animal each time. When the procedure was completed, the pig was carried by a
technician back to its primary enclosure and was noted to be limping and not wanting to bear weight on the right
hind limb. A veterinarian was contacted, the fracture diagnosed by radiography, and the pig was euthanized per the
principal investigator in consult with the veterinarian.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Correction should include continuing to implement training of personnel in handling of animals and ensuring all
equipment is appropriate for handling of all animals.

SANITATION.
On the morning of 10/9/2014, a cage housing two guinea pigs, identification #3002 and #3003, had accumulated
approximately 2 inches of water following a leak from the automatic water lines above the rack of cages.
Premises were not kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The facility has moved the racks of guinea
pig cages so they are 6 inches away from the wall where the water lines are secured.
Further corrections should be pursued by the facility (eg. disconnecting unused water lines) and should be put into
place by 11/17/2014.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A large, male Rhesus macaque, RQ8549, was able to break the lock on its primary enclosure shortly after beingreceived from another facility and being moved into a quarantine room. The macaque escaped from its enclosure
into the animal room and needed to be darted by the veterinary staff to be captured and placed into a new
enclosure.
The facility did not have enclosures available that were sturdy enough for larger male macaques when this animal
arrived at the facility. Enclosures that are not structurally sound or sturdy enough to contain the animals pose a risk
for escape and for a risk of injury to the animals.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must contain the animals securely.
The facility has added a secondary mechanism to secure the enclosures as a temporary correction.
Enclosures that are suitable for larger male macaques should be available for use prior to acquisition of these
animals.
Inspection conducted on October 15-17, 2014 with facility representatives, APHIS AC VMO, CDC representatives,
and VS-SA Inspector.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representatives on November 14, 2014.
