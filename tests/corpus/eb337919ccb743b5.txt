ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1700 on
05/24/2016. Licensee was out town exhibiting some of his animals. Also, there was not a current itinerary on file,
showing the location of animals while out of town.
A current itinerary showing times, dates and animals to be exhibited as well as any lay over locations between
exhibiting needs to be sent to the Western Regional office of Animal Care.
To be corrected by June 1,2016
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee by phone.
