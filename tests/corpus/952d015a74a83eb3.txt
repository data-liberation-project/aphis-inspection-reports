3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
The lower building's dividers have a build-up of dark colored grime, mostly on the upper part of the dividers. A build-up of
grime can contain germs and is a surface that can't be sanitized correctly. Ensure that surfaces in the enclosures are
cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris.
3.31(b)

Sanitation.
The area on the north side of the upper guinea pig building is overgrown with weeds and has old building materials laying
around that don't allow regular trimming of the weeds. Overgrown areas of weeds with old building materials create areas
for rodents to live and if rodents become established they can affect the guinea pigs. Ensure that this area is free from
old building material so that the brush and weeds can be trimmed on a regular basis.
