3.101(a)(2) Direct

Facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, two California sea lions and one South American sea lion were left unattended in their travel
trailer for a period no less than 4.5 hours without a proper public barrier in place and without a single identifiable
employee.
The inspector arrived at the licensee’s TRA site at approximately 4:20pm EST and identified a marine mammal exhibit set
up complete with two pools, a stage, a travel trailer containing the sea lions, a residential trailer and a small fence
bordering the exhibition area. The fence noticeably stopped at the edges of the travel trailer and did not form a barrier
barring entrance into the trailer containing the sea lions. The inspector observed a drink concessions trailer being dropped
off adjacent to sea lion exhibit. Three individuals working on this task identified themselves as employees of the
concession stand and mentioned that they had nothing to do with the licensee’s business. They were seen walking
unsupervised around the TRA site in order to maneuver their trailer. After calling the licensee and leaving a voicemail
requesting to conduct an inspection, the inspector knocked on the licensee’s residential trailer and loudly identified herself
as an USDA inspector. There was no response from either the residential trailer or the travel trailer holding the sea lions.
A quick inspection around the outside of the trailer and surrounding areas confirmed that none of the Sea Lion Splash
LLC employees or the licensee were on site. The licensee was called again at approximately 5:47pm EST and a


voicemail was left requesting a return phone call.
While waiting for an employee to return to the site, the inspector observed that the back of the trailer containing the sea
lions, their food and necessary water quality chemicals had no public barrier and was left completely open so that the
public could easily walk approach the trailer containing the 3 sea lions. The trailer door to the freezer storing fish was left
open, and the freezer door was not seen to have a locking mechanism. Furthermore, the trailer door to the transport
enclosure housing the three sea lions had been left completely open and any person could easily step into the trailer and
interact with the animals. The sea lions could be heard vocalizing/splashing around and observed from outside the trailer.
The door to their enclosure consisted of thin metal bars that could allow the smaller two sea lions to poke their heads
through. The width of spaces between the metal bars could allow any member of the public to touch and/or pass food
through to the animals. Furthermore, under the steps leading up to the sea lion enclosure, a large collection of cleaning
and water quality chemicals were being stored. These were within easy access to any passing individual.
Until the licensee’s employee finally arrived, the inspector observed various individuals entering the county fair property
through an unguarded gate directly across from the TRA set up. There was not a security guard posted at the gate
entrance, and the inspector did not observe any readily identifiable security officials patrolling throughout the county fair
property. Additionally, various employees from different exhibitors/concession stands/fair rides were seen driving golf
carts or walking around the TRA set up.
The complete lack of employee supervision over the animals and the lack of a physical barrier barring entrance to the
animals for a period of almost 4.5 hours severely compromised the safety of the animals. Any member of the public could
have entered the trailer and harmed the animals or have been harmed by the sea lions. Additionally, the chemicals were
openly available to be tampered with or used to harm the animals. The current public barrier does nothing to impede
access to the sea lions or their food whenever the employees are not directly supervising the animals. Additionally, the


licensee’s reliance on the fair ground’s security to supervise the animals is inadequate to provide protection to the animals
from abuse and harassment by the viewing public.
All marine mammals must be provided with protection from abuse and harassment by the viewing public by the use of a
sufficient number of uniformed or readily identifiable employees or attendants to supervise the viewing public, or by
physical barriers, such as fences, walls, glass partitions, or distance, or any combination of these.
