RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The "Record of Dogs on Hand" (APHIS from 7005) forms are not filled out completely. The name and address from
whom the dogs were purchased and/or acquired and the date of birth were not completed. Accurate and
appropriate documentation on acquired animals is essential for identification and tracking of animals. The licensee
must make, keep and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the acquisition and disposition information
of all dogs acquired, owned, held, kept in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which are transported,
euthanized, sold or otherwise disposed of.
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor runs on the west side of the "chihuahua" building have wire mesh for the flooring that are severely
rusted. The rust is pitting and flaking and in some areas the rust has eroded the metal causing it to break. There are
a total of twenty-five dogs in the affected enclosures. Rust can affect the structural strength of surfaces and
prevents thorough cleaning and sanitization of the primary enclosures, which can lead to disease hazards for the
dogs. All rusted surfaces in contact with the dogs must be repaired or replaced in order to allow them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized and to ensure structural strength.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces
There is chewed and/or worn wood and chewed plastic throughout the facility. The areas with chewed and/or worn
wood and chewed plastic include the "red-roofed" building, the "tool shed" building, and the "chihuahua" building.
The plastic paneling in the "red-roofed" building is chewed in the southwest pen (2 dogs), the southeast pen (2
dogs), and the middle pen on the east side (2 dogs). There is s section of wood in the enclosure on the east side of
the north room of the "tool shed" building that has a hole chewed in it approximately 18 inches tall by 12 inches
wide. On the outdoor enclosures on the north side of the "tool shed" building a piece of plastic is broken exposingbare wood in two enclosures (7 dogs). There are at least two outdoor enclosures of the "chichuahua" building where
the plastic siding is missing from the side of the building exposing bare wood and holes in the building (6 dogs). In
other areas, the chewed and/or worn wood is located on posts within the enclosures and/or on the thresholds
around the dog doors. All of these areas are within the primary enclosures and are in direct contact with the dogs.
Some of the areas that are severely chewed and worn have hair and/or dirt stuck to the chewed areas.
There are severely chewed and worn plastic feeders scattered throughout the facility. The severely chewed areas
have dust, dirt, hair, debris, and/or grime embedded in them.
Severely chewed and worn surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards for
the dogs. All chewed and worn surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they can be readily cleaned and sanitized.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning
Within a large number of primary enclosures throughout the facility there are varying degrees of dust, dirt, debris,
and/or dark brown/black grime on the walls, dog doors and/or thresholds surrounding the dog doors. The
enclosures
with dirty surfaces are located within the "red-roofed" building, "tool shed"building, "Hunte" building, "big barn"
building, and the "chihuahua" building.
Within the "red-roofed" building there is a build-up of dust, dirt, and grime throughout the facility. The dog doors
have a build up of grime on the thresholds and around the frame and there is a build-up of brown grime on the
outside wall in all of the enclosures (14 dogs).
Within the "tool shed" building, there is a build-up of dirt, dust, and grime on the walls of the enclosures that are on
the north side of the building. There is also and accumulation of a brown grime on the doors and the walls of the
outdoor portion of the enclosures (10 dogs).
The outdoor walls and dog doors and thresholds of the "chihuahua" building, the "Hunte" building, and the "big
barn" have varying degrees of a brown build-up of grime. (at least 100 dogs)
Throughout the facility there are feeders with varying degrees of a build-up of dust, dirt, grime and/or caked feed on
both the inside and outside surfaces of the feeders. The areas with dirty feeders are within the "dalmatian" building,
"red-roofed" building, "tool shed" building, "Hunte" building, "big barn" building, and the "big dog runs,"
Failure to spot-clean daily and sanitize primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards for thedogs. All hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once
every two weeks, and more often if necessary, to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are several sharp wire points throughout the facility. The sharp points are within multiple primary enclosures
and are in direct contact with the dogs. The majority of the sharp points are the result of broken wire mesh on the
walls or floor of the primary enclosure. The ends of the broken mesh create sharp points that protrude into the
enclosure.
The housing areas containing sharp points are the "chihuahua building," and the "big building." There are at least 25
dogs in the affected enclosures. Sharp points present an injury hazard to the animals. All cages must be
constructed and maintained so they have no sharp points or edges that can injure the animals.
3.6(a)(2)(10) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Within the "big building" and the "chihuahua" building there are multiple enclosures with holes in the floor large
enough for an animals' feet and/or legs to pass through. The majority of the holes are the result of broken wire
mesh
flooring. The broken flooring creates gaps large enough to allow the dogs' feet and/or legs to pass through the floor.
There are at least 4 dogs in the affected enclosures. Flooring that allows all or part of the dogs feet and/or legs to
pass through can lead to animal injury and can make it difficult for the animals to walk. All floors must be repaired or
replaced so they protect the dogs' feet and legs from injury and so they do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through
any openings in the floor.
