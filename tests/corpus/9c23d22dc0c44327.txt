3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
--The side of a stall containing one adult, female pig has an ~4-5" gash in the sheet metal, resulting in sharp edges at a
level where the animal could easily come into contact with it.
--The large, main enclosure, accessible to 21 goats, two llamas and four pigs of unknown sex, has multiple sections of
fencing with rusted bailing wire twisted around it, with the sharp ends of the wire directed toward the interior of the pen.
--The sheltered alleyway and pens accessible to the nine zebu cattle at the time of inspection have several areas where
rusted bailing wire is twisted around the fencing as well as the large gate at the end of the alleyway. The wires have
sharp points directed toward areas where animals can come into contact with them.
Sharp metal edges and wires with points can injure animals. The licensee must ensure that facilities are structurally sound
and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility maintains 21 goats, five pigs, two llamas and nine zebu cattle in the outdoor portions of the premises. The
perimeter fence enclosing the facility is less than six feet in height all the way around. The fence is inadequate because it


cannot serve as a secondary containment system for the animals housed outdoors at the facility, and cannot prevent
other animals and unauthorized persons from entering.
The licensee must modify the existing fence or install a different perimeter fence or fences of at least 6 feet in height (for
the species inventoried at the time of this inspection), a minimum of three feet from the primary enclosures, and
constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by restricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons
from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the animals in the facility.
