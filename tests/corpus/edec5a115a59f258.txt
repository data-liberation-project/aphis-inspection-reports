2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30 PM on
08-NOV-17.
I waited at the facility for half an hour and no one arrived. During that time, I called the contact number and left a
message requesting information on availability of licensee to allow an inspection. An inspection is required to
ensure the welfare of all animals licensed under the Animal Welfare Act.
Provide an updated itinerary that provides sufficient information to allow completion of an inspection.
