ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Coton ("Ike", 101 074 310) has a thick buildup of a brown/tan material on the cheek teeth on both sides of
his mouth. The material has completely encased the cheek teeth and their shape is no longer identifiable. The
material is also covering nearly the entire surface of the upper front teeth and canine teeth. There is a white creamy
substance along the gum line of the cheek teeth on the right side of the mouth. The gums have become moderately
reddened. Poor dental health can cause pain and discomfort as well as lead to further health complications.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The
diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
A correction date of May 12, 2016 was verbally communicated to the licensee during the exit interview.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The shelters in the outdoor beagle enclosures have no wind or rain breaks at the entrance doors. Wind and rain
breaks are necessary in order to ensure that the dogs can escape inclement weather and remain dry. There are
eight dogs housed in these enclosures. The licensee must provide a wind and rain break at the front of all shelters
within the dog enclosures. The licensee must ensure that all shelters have a wind and rain break in order to
promote the dogs' health and well-being.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the open building, the fronts of the shelters are covered in plywood. The enclosures had been recently washed
out and the plywood appeared damp. There is a green organic material on the lower half of several of the pieces ofplywood. The licensee stated that the shelters were constructed of treated plywood but they could be at least ten
years old. There are at least five dogs housed in these enclosures.
There are three large outdoor enclosures housing eight beagles. Each enclosure has a shade structure made of
wood and placed just above the ground. The dogs lay under the structures and are capable of climbing up on the
structures. The wooden surfaces of all the structures has begun to crack in multiple areas.
One enclosure, housing four beagles, has a shelter constructed of wood. The surface of this wood has numerous
small cracks and also has damage from the dogs chewing on the wood. Old, worn and damaged wood could allow
moisture to be absorbed into the wood which could affect the structural integrity.
Building surfaces that are in contact with the animals must be impervious to moisture. The wood surfaces must be
altered in a manner that makes them impervious to moisture. The licensee must ensure that all wood structures
and surfaces are kept in good repair and remain impervious to moisture.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "training pen" there is a smaller enclosure that the dogs have access to. The enclosure sits up off the ground
and the flooring is constructed in sections. One section has come loose and has left a gap in the flooring that is
large enough for a dog's leg to pass through and could result in injury to the dog. Four dogs have access to this
enclosure.
Enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury and
does not have openings large enough for the dogs' feet to pass through. The licensee must replace, repair, or alter
the floor in a manner that will not allow the animals' feet and legs to pass through. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures are safe for the dogs at all time.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are three large outdoor enclosures housing eight beagles. There is a large amount of grass and weeds
growing through all the fencing of the enclosures. The grass in some areas has grown higher than the beagles. Inthe "training pen" the grass, brush and weeds are so high that it completely covers the beagles and the dogs cannot
be seen. The lower half of the fencing of the "training pen" is unable to be seen as it is covered in weeds and grass.
There are four beagles contained within the "training pen". Overgrown grass, weeds, and brush can inhibit
adequate observation of the animals, the enclosure and the enclosure fencing as well as attract vermin and other
pests.
Weeds, grasses and shrubbery on the premises must be controlled. The licensee must trim the grass, weeds and
brush down to a level that allows for adequate inspection of the facility and animals and reduces the potential of
attracting vermin.
Correction date: May 19, 2016
Also, located in the "training pen" is a large amount of unused and discarded materials. The materials consist of
animal traps, fence panels, plastic buckets, rolls and strands of barbed wire, metal barrels and a large number of
miscellaneous metal items. The majority of the unused/discarded materials are lying in a creek within the "training
pen". During the inspection the dogs were observed to be running across the items in the creek. The
unused/discarded materials could cause injury to the dogs as they move across and around them.
Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products and discarded materials. The licensee
must remove all unused/discarded materials from the "training pen" in order to eliminate the risk of injury to the
dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures and premises are kept free of unused materials in order to
eliminate the injury risk to the dogs.
