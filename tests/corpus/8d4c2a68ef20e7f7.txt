Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1245 on 08 Dec 22.

Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the house door and honked my horn. I also called the contact number provided
and left a message.
