3.11(b)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
On today's inspection 90% of the enclosures housing the adult dogs were not clean enough. Two enclosures have
an excessive amount of brown/black matter adhered to the doggy door. All of the enclosures on the inside with tops
have an excessive amount of dust, dirt, cobwebs and debris on the top wire mesh. In addition, at least 75% of the
inside front mesh and 25% of the outside front mesh of the enclosures have a varying amount of rust and are
coated with durt, debris, food waste, excreta and other organic matter. Not having a proper routine for cleaning is
directly contributing to the odor that is currently within the facility and exposes the dogs to unnecessary disease
hazards. The Licensee must ensure that all used primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized at least once every
2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
