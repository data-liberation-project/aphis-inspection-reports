Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Facility representatives were unable to produce disposition paperwork for all of the goats and mouflon sold since the last
inspection on May 25, 2022.
This paperwork is essential for ensuring proper disposition and/or transfer of the animals and their humane use. The
licensee must make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information as listed in the
Animal Welfare Act regulations (Section 2.75(b)(1)(i-vii)) concerning animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned,
held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized or
otherwise disposed of by the licensee. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her
possession or under his or her control.
TO BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 24, 2022.
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
At the time of the inspection, the pen containing 15 mouflon of various sexes and ages is diffusely muddy, with no dry
areas on which the animals can stand to escape the mud and no route to access food or water without walking through
the mud.


Standing water and mud can cause animals discomfort, promote skin and hoof problems, and encourage the growth of
pathogens as well as the presence of pests and vermin. The licensee must provide a suitable method to rapidly eliminate
excess water or otherwise prevent the situation where the animals have no dry surfaces on which to stand and walk to
reach food and water. Any methods for correcting drainage shall comply with applicable Federal, state and local laws and
regulations pertaining to pollution control or the protection of the environment.
TO BE CORRECTED BY SEPTEMBER 10, 2022.
