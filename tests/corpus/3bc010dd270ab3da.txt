3.53(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The wire mesh enclosures are very rusty and there are broken sections creating holes in the wire with sharp points that
could injure the rabbits. The structural strength of the wire has been compromised through the cleaning process of
flaming, and the severe rust has caused corrosion. The wire must be repaired or the enclosures replaced to protect the
rabbits from injury and maintain them securely within.
3.53(c)(1)

Primary enclosures.
There are 6 cages measuring 24 inches by 24 inches. Each enclosure houses 8 - 10 weaned bunnies weighing less than
4.4 lbs. Weaned bunnies less than 4.4 lbs require a minimum of 1.5 sq ft of floor space. These enclosures only provide 4
sq ft which is an insufficient amount of space for the number of bunnies housed within. Inadequate floor space inhibits
normal postural adjustments and freedom of movement. The number of bunnies housed within these enclosures shall be
decreased or larger enclosures provided to allow each bunny a minimum of 1.5 sq ft.

caked food in the mesh. Rusty metal cannot be adequately sanitized and may allow contamination of the feed. Rusty
feeders shall be removed, repaired, or replaced to protect the feed from becoming contaminated from inadequate
sanitation and provide for the health and well being of the rabbits..

Sanitation.


There is excessive excreta accumulating in the barn attracting flies. There are flies swarming inside the barn around the
rabbits. Insects may carry disease hazards and cause discomfort to the rabbits. The fly strips hung in attempt to control
the flies are full making them less effective in catching the flies. An effective program to control the insects shall be
established and maintained to provide for the health and well being of the rabbits.
