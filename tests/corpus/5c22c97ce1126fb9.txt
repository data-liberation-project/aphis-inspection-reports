ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**Wazine, a wormer medication labeled for turkeys, chickens, and swine, was reported to have been prescribed for
use in the rabbits, and was reported to have been added to the water. There is no proper prescription label on the
bottle for its use in the rabbits, no written instructions, and there is no record of its use.
**An expired tube of EnteDerm was in the medication box. It was discarded a the time of inspection.
**A rabbit, Joker, was discovered to have a head tilt on 8/15/2016. He wasn't seen by the Attending Veterinarian
(AV) until 9/2/2016. Otitis media was diagnosed and medications were prescribed. Another rabbit, Nutmeg, was
noted to have "crusty ears" on 8/25/2016, and wasn't seen by the veterinarian until 9/2/2016. Ear mites were
diagnosed and treatment was prescribed. The facility manager said that the AV was out of town during the time of
the gap of time between discovery of illness and treatment. The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not have a
back-up veterinarian listed to cover for such times when the AV is unavailable.
The licensee must ensure that appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries
are provided in a timely manner, and must provide documentation of these veterinary evaluations and treatments (if
prescribed) to the inspectors upon request. Delay of treatment can cause unnecessary suffering. The medication
supply must be monitored to ensure that expired medications are discarded so that they are not inadvertently used
in the animals. Only medications labeled for or prescribed for the rabbits are to be used in the rabbits.
This is a repeat non-compliant item previously cited on 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015, and 4/12/2016.
3.52(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Upon arrival to the facility on 9/6/2016, no one was present in the rabbit area, but the gate to the area was open. A
fence is required around an outdoor housing facility to prevent access to the animals by predators. An open gate
defeats that purpose of the fence.
Correct by keeping the gate closed when not working with the animals from now on.3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Many of the cages are again hanging at a slant, and the floors are un-reinforced wire. The floors bounce quite a bit
when the animals move around, especially the larger animals. Excess movement and slant of the floors can be hard
on the animals' legs, and the movement can fatigue the metal, causing it to break.
One animal knocked its feeder to the ground on the morning of 9/7/2016, leaving a large open area where the
feeder is to mount. Such an opening could be a means of escape, potentially resulting in injury or death of the
animal.
This is a repeat non-compliant item previously cited on reports dated 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015, and
4/12//2016.
3.53(c)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**One cage contains 8 rabbits, which appear to be a doe and her litter. The juvenile rabbits are well past weaning
age. The cage measures 30"(cid:29) x 24" x 18" high(cid:25). This is 5 square feet or 0.625 square feet per rabbit.
One cage measuring 30"(cid:29) x 24" x 18" high contains 5 rabbits. This is 5 square feet or 1.0 square foot per rabbit.
One cage measuring 30" x 30" x 18 high contains 7 young rabbits. This is 6.25 square feet, or 0.89 square feet per
rabbit.
A black rabbit on the quarantine area is in a cage measuring 24" x 12.5" x 14" high. With >2" of bedding, the height
is inadequate. This size of rabbit requires a minimum of 3 square feet of floor space; this cage provides just over 2
square feet.
The two pairs of NZ cross rabbits previously cited twice for inadequate floor space are still housed in the same sized
cages as at the time of those citations.
Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum amount of floor space according to USDA
APHIS Animal Welfare Act regulations. Juveniles weighing less than 4.4 lbs require 1.5 square feet of floor space
each.
Housing rabbits in an inappropriately sized enclosure may stress the animals. This can lead to increased
susceptibility to disease, incompatibility, and fighting. Rabbits must be housed in enclosures with the minimum
required floor space for their health and well-being.
Previously cited on 11/30/2015 and 4/12/2016.
3.54(b)FEEDING.
A rabbit named Devin has a self-feeder in the cage with excessive rust, and with damp and caked feed on one end.
Care must be taken when using self-feeders to ensure they are clean, in good repair, and that the food is not
allowed to spoil. Damp, caked feed may mold, becoming unwholesome and unsafe for the animals.
Correct by ensuring from now on that the feeders are kept clean and dry, and daily checking the feed for signs of
deterioration.
3.61(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE RABBITS.
**This facility is still using blue Rubbermaid-type totes with removable tops on a regular basis to transport rabbits to
and from parties. The ventilation openings for the rabbits while in these totes are small holes that have been placed
in the top of the tote lids, and small holes on the upper ends. The amount of ventilation per side does not meet the
requirement of 16% on two opposite sides. Inadequate ventilation can restrict necessary airflow to the animals and
result in overheating or otherwise compromise health during transportation. Although staff indicated they remove the
lids during transport, this is not appropriately containing the rabbits. At the time of this inspection, an associate was
preparing to leave for a party with 17 rabbits in four of these totes. One rabbit from the first tote placed in the car on
9/6/2016 did get out of the tote while the worker was getting the second tote. One tote contained so many rabbits
that they covered the entire floor space.
All licensees are required to ensure that transport enclosures for rabbits have ventilation openings located on two
opposite walls of the primary enclosure and that the ventilation openings on each wall are at least 16 percent of the
total surface area. Alternately, transport enclosures for rabbits may have ventilation openings located on all four
walls of the primary enclosure provided that those openings are at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each
wall.
As they are currently constructed the Rubbermaid-type totes do not provide adequate ventilation or structural
strength as required. Correct by ensuring that all transport enclosure used in the future are constructed in a manner
that adequate ventilation is provided to all animals and that all other requirements for enclosure construction are
met.
This is a repeat non-compliant item cited previously on reports dated 4/1/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015, and
4/12/2016.
3.61(c)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE RABBITS.One of the totes used to transport rabbits at the time of inspection on 9/6/2016 had so many rabbits in it that the
floor of the container was not visible.
Containers used to transport rabbits must have enough space for the animals to move around freely and to make
normal postural adjustments. Overcrowding can cause undue stress for the animals.
Correct immediately by using appropriate transport containers and limit the number of animals in each container so
they have space to move around as required.
This inspection was conducted on 9/6-7/2016, and the exit interview was conducted on 9/7/2016 with facility
representatives.
