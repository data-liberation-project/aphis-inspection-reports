FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The show ring is 11 foot high with a half moon extension which provides 13 more inches of height at the tallest
point. During the show, the tigers sit on two foot high pedestals and for part of the act are elevated up to 6 feet in
the air while on a show apparatus. This same ring is sometimes used for an exercise pen. Although the trainer
states there is a cover for the ring, it is not in use at this venue and was not used during the last inspection on
2-24-17. The trainer also stated the top is not used if the setup is outside of a building. Tigers have been known to
jump out of twelve foot enclosures, so in order to properly contain the tigers at all times this show ring needs to be
made more secure by adding height, kick-ins, or always using the top covering. To be corrected by 5-5-17.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
During this inspection twelve tigers are kept in pairs in enclosures which measure 4 feet high. Because these
enclosures do not allow for full postural and social adjustments, including stretching upward, these cats must be
allowed out into an exercise area with sufficient height at least once a day for an appropriate period of time,
excluding performance and practice time. During this inspection, the tigers were seen in their enclosures from
10:30 AM through until the 7 PM show time. They were not taken to the building and put in the show ring for
exercise at any time during the day. There is no other exercise pen of any type available to allow the tigers to make
normal postural adjustments. During the last travel inspection on 2-24-17, the tigers were not put into the show ring
for exercise as the trainer was not available long enough to do so. He admitted at that time the tigers do not always
get to exercise daily.
If the cages are not changed or modified to provide sufficient height for the tigers to make normal postural
adjustments including stretching up, then they have to have available daily exercise in an enclosure which provides
this height.
To be corrected by 5-5-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with trainer.
