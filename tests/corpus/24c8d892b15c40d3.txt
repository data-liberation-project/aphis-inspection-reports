2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility has a back area where the public is allowed to feed deer that walk up to them. This back area did not
have a readily identifiable employee present in that area to supervise the public contact with the animals. Even
though the interaction between the public and deer was seen to be tranquil during the inspection, having a readily
identifiable and knowledgeable employee/attendant present any time there is public contact with animals is required
to protect the deer and public in case of any negative interaction that might inadvertently occur during the visitors'
walk-through. The facility must ensure that a readily identifiable and knowledgeable person is present during all
times when the public can contact animals.
Correct prior to allowing public contact with animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
