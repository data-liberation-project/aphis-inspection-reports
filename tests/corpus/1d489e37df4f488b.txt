There are wire points protruding into the three enclosures from the wires used to secure the plastic pipe to the
divider panels on the outdoor elevated enclosures.
Also two heat lamps in the large dog whelping building are in use where the heat lamp bulbs are not protected
from contact with the dogs in these enclosures.

Hot bulbs and wire points may cause injury to the dogs in these enclosures. All housing facilities must be
constructed in a manner that protects the dogs from injury.

3.4(b)(4) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The dogs housed in approximately 16 outdoor dog shelters are supplied with a limited amount of bedding, but do
not have adequate bedding for the current climatic conditions. The temperature at the time of the inspection as
recorded by the Inspector'(cid:25)s Kestrel was 26.5 degrees F. Lack of bedding can cause discomfort to the dogs and
may lead to the dogs not being able to maintain normal body temperature. All shelters must be provided with
bedding when temperatures are below 50 degrees F and additional clean, dry bedding when temperatures are
below 35 degrees F. Correct by the close of business today.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility reperesentative.
