3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Each indoor dog enclosure contains a food receptacle. The majority of these receptacles show signs of damage
from being chewed on by the dogs. As a result, this allows dirt and food waste to penetrate into the surface which
can result in disease hazards. The food receptacles need to be replaced or altered in a manner that allows for
proper cleaning and sanitization every 2 weeks.
Affects no less than 10 dogs
