2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The female black alpaca (mother of the cinnamon baby alpaca) housed in the
enclosure with 5 other alpacas has little or no hair growth on about two inches of skin on the top of her nose. The
hair loss on the bridge of her nose extends down both sides of the nose. There was no documentation of this
condition in the records for the animals or of the attending veterinarian being consulted. Hair loss can have many
causes such as parasites, infectious, nutritional, and may be a sign of a more serious health concern. Each
exhibitor must establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by having the female black alpaca
evaluated by the attending veterinarian and following the recommendations of the veterinarian. Correct by
November 7, 2016.
This inspection was conducted with the animal caretakers. The exit interview was conducted with the facility
co-owner and the farm hand/office receptionist.
