ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Two guinea pigs, # 27604 and # 27675, had pink cards noting a veterinary care issue on their enclosures. Upon
inspection, it was observed that each animal had a large lesion measuring approximately one inch wide and 1/2
inch in height over the shoulder blade area. The lesions were wet, with red, hairless tissue exposed. According to
staff, the lesions had resulted as a serious reaction to an adjuvant injection given as part of a study. Upon reviewing
the corresponding Veterinary Services Report for each animal, and discussing the matter with the attending
veterinarian, it was found that although the lesions were first observed on 1/25/16, the attending veterinarian had
not been consulted until the day of inspection (1/28/16). The attending veterinarian was on site at the time of
inspection, and treated the animals. Minutes from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee highlighted a
similar incident - failure to notify the attending veterinarian of an animal requiring veterinary care - in June, 2015. It
was suggested at that time that further training of staff should be provided on this issue.
Animals should be observed on a daily basis, and medical problems should be promptly communicated to the
attending veterinarian, so that appropriate treatment, or other measures to relieve pain and distress, can commence
in a timely manner. Failure to consult the attending veterinarian could result in unnecessary animal suffering. The
facility should take steps to ensure appropriate and timely observation and communication.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
