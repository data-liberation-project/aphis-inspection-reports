ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult red fox was observed scratching at its head/ear area and underside of the neck and rubbing its body
against the chain link fence consistently for about 5 minutes. This animal is molting and while patchy hair loss is
commonly seem during a molt, there appears to be excessive hair loss and visible skin along the right side of the
body and hip bones by the head of the tail. Molting is common at this time of the year but excessive scratching and
hair loss in patterns not expected with molting can indicate problems such as infection, parasites, and other medical
problems.The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian to determine if this is normal
molting or to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and
followed. The licensee must document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon
request.
