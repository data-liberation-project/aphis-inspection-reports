ANNUAL REPORT.
***In May 2014, a protocol (S12929) which proposed food fasting diabetic pigs up to 36 hours for purposes of the
study was approved by a designated IACUC member. The protocol stated, "In the case of test materials intended to
have PK/PD activity for up to 24 hours, animals may be fasted for up to 36 hours". This exception to the standards
of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) was not acknowledged as an exception in the protocol nor was it attached to the
facility's 2014 Annual Report. The Principal Investigator (PI) stated within the protocol that there were "No
exceptions" to the standards and regulations promulgated under the AWA for the care and use of warm-blooded
animals. According to the AWA, animals such as pigs must be fed at least once a day. The registrant must ensure
that exceptions to the standards and regulations of the AWA are justified by the PI, approved by the IACUC, and
included with the Annual Report so the Administrator can ensure that minimal standards not being met are
scientifically justified. To be corrected by: August 29, 2015
The inspection was conducted on July 27-29, 2015 by Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO) and Dr. Amanda Owens (VMO) with
facility representatives. The exit interview was conducted on July 29, 2015 with facility representatives.
