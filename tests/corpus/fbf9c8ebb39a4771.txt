MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling. An adverse event occurred involving an anesthetized pig undergoing a surgical procedure. The use of
an electrocautery device ignited alcohol vapors and a localized flame caused injury to the animal. Immediate
actions included extinguishing the flame and euthanizing the anesthetized animal under veterinary oversight.
Handling of all animals must be done in a manner that does not cause trauma. The facility addressed this incident
in several ways, including: instructing the team to revise procedures and posting specific instructions on surgical
fire prevention in the operating room for reference.
This item has been addressed by the facility and was self- reported to USDA.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Exemptions. At the time of inspection there were seven singly housed baboons assigned to research studies but
not yet started. Two of the animals were assigned to a protocol that did not contain an IACUC approved scientific
exemption to social housing. The remaining five animals were assigned to protocols that the IACUC had approved
an exemption to social housing when enrolled on study to minimize risks, which that rationale had not yet occurred.
Social housing is the current standard for social animals, like baboons, when not specifically exempted which
benefits the animal's health and well-being. The facility has plans underway to address their social housing needs.
