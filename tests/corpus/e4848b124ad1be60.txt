ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This facility does not currently have a written Program of Veterinarian Care. The facility does have a veterinarian
that they currently contact for issues that they do not feel capable of caring for themselves without the guidance of
the veterinarian. However; they do not have regularly scheduled visits with this veterinarian to look at the facility,
animals and to update their program of veterinarian care on an annual basis. In addition, they do not have written
guidance from a licensed veterinarian for routine preventive medicine, vaccinations, routine procedures or specific
routine health problems for the facility. A written Program of Veterinarian Care is required under the Animal Welfare
Act to ensure that all animals receive the adequate level of care set forth by acceptable standards. This facility
must have a written program of Veterinarian Care to include guidance on how to use and when to use of
medications, vaccinations, routine procedures, etc. In addition, the Program of Veterinarian Care must be made
available for inspection by APHIS Officials.
