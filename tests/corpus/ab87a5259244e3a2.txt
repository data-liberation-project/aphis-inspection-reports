Contingency planning.
The facility does not have a documented contingency plan.
If an emergency or natural disaster were to occur at the facility, the lack of a written contingency plan could impact animal
health if the staff are not prepared to respond to the situation appropriately.
Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate contingency plan to provide for the humane handling,
treatment, transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the the event of an emergency or disaster.
