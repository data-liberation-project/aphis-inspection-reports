MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
The licensee transported (to Wheaton, MO) and sold a Mini Australian Sheppard puppy with the ID# 33A1 that was
born on 9/18/14 and was 51 days of age. No dog shall be offered for transport before 56 days (8 weeks) of age.
Removing animals before this age can cause additional stress and may increase the animal(cid:25)s likelihood of
contracting a disease or becoming ill since young puppies immune systems have not fully developed before this
time. The licensee must ensure that birth dates are crosschecked properly before offering a puppy for sale or
transporting, to prevent animals from leaving the premises before they reach the required minimum age. TO BE
CORRECTED: From this point forward.
This inspection was conducted at the delivery point. Once notified that the animal was underage the buyer returned
the puppy to the seller. An exit briefing was conducted at the close of the inspection.
