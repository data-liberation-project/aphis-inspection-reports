ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1530 on
01-Dec-16. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I called the licensee and
left a message asking him to call me back. I honked the horn and waited 30 minutes before leaving the property.
End of report.
