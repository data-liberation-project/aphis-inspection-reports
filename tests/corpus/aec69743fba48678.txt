A focused inspection was conducted to re-evaluate two animals identified as needing hoof trimming due to
excessively long hooves noted on the inspection on 12/17/2014. A male llama and female zebu were observed to
have received hoof trims since the previous inspection. The attending veterinarian had not yet met with the licensee
to develop a plan for appropriate hoof trimming schedules to prevent chronic changes in the animals' feet and legs.
This plan should be developed within the next week and be made available to APHIS officials for review.

Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
