Handling of animals.
Inspectors observed that none of the sheep or alpacas on the premises had been sheared as of August 2nd,2022.
Temperatures in the area have been routinely rising above 90 degrees Fahrenheit and was listed as having a high of 92
degrees on the day of inspection. It was noted that the sheep in need of shearing had an increased respiratory rate
compared to the haired sheep and goats in the same enclosure. Although the enclosure is covered and provides ample
shade, animals like sheep and alpacas that require shearing each year, are susceptible to overheating in the summer
months if the excess wool or hair is not removed prior to the consistent increase in temperature that occurs each year.
Handling of all animals shall be done in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, behavioral stress, physical
harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
Inspectors observed a large influx of ground squirrels in the enclosures and throughout the outdoor areas of the facility.
The squirrels were observed climbing on and over stored items and equipment within the barn and the storage area
located on the east side of the facility, as well as eating the fresh fruits and vegetables in the Baboon enclosure. Squirrel
burrows were noted throughout the facility and within enclosures exposing dig barriers and beneath building foundations.


Ground squirrels could potentially be a reservoir for contagious disease and parasites and could potentially contaminate
the feed being provided. The burrows not only provide an opportunity for injury if an animal were to step into one, but they
can also damage the structural strength of the facility and enclosures. A safe and effective program for the control of
insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Although it is recognized
that efforts have been made to control the squirrels, it has not been effective as the inspectors noticed an increase in the
activity of the squirrels.
