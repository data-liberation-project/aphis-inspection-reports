2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1732 on
06-Feb-18. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I called the licensee by
phone and spoke to a coworker who informed me he was not available. I waited thirty minutes. I then left the
property.
End of report.
