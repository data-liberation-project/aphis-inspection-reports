TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Three enclosures containing a total of eight weaned puppies didn't have identification. Lack of identification doesn't
allow for the animals to be easily identified. Provide identification for all weaned puppies with an official tag or a
plastic-type collar or cage card attached to the enclosure containing the information required on an official tag.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An enclosure containing 4 weaned puppies did not provide the minimum amount of required floor space. The
enclosure measured 36 inches by 30 inches for a total of 1,080 square inches. Three of the puppies measured 11
inches and one measured 10 inches. Together they require 1,123 square inches. The enclosure is 43 inches too
small. Inadequate space may affect their comfort and limit the opportunity for exercise. The puppies must be
moved to a larger enclosure that provides the minimum required floor space or if maintained in the same enclosure,
must be divided amongst another enclosure to meet the space requirements. Correct immediately.
