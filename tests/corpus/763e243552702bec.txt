ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1725 on
05/19/2016. I knocked on the licensee's front door and no one answered. I called the licensee and left a message.
I waited thirty minutes and then left. About a half hour after I left, the licensee called me back and informed me that
he was planning on cancelling his license as he no longer conducts regulated activity. I informed him to send a fax
to the regional office indicating he would like to cancel his license. He said he would do that.
End of report.
