ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 on
14-Nov-17. Voicemails were left at the available phone numbers; no one answered the door to the facility. The
owner called back and stated that no personnel were available at that time. Optimal hours for inspections were
discussed.
Without access to conduct the inspection, the regulatory process is impossible. Licensees must ensure a
knowledgeable facility representative is available to accompany the inspection during normal business hours.
Correct from this time forward.
