2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
On January 29th, 2016 an adult male goat was being transferred from the housing facility to a transport vehicle. The
goat escaped its transport enclosure and ran into the woods near the facility. The facility representatives have made
several attempts to capture the animal, but have been unable to do so. Improper handling practices led to the
animal escape. An animal escape can cause distress, trauma and/or physical harm to the animal. Handling
of all animals must be done as carefully as possible and in a manner that cannot lead to an animal escape which
can
cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort for the animal.
As a result of this incident, the facility is reviewing and altering their transport procedures, developing new large
animal transport protocols, and altering the premises to prevent an escape in the future.
To be corrected from this day forward.
This is a focused inspection to address an animal escape.
Inspection conducted with the Institutional Official and the Director of the Office of the IACUC.
An exit briefing was conducted with the Director of the Office of the IACUC.
