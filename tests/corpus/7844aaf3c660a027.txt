HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The primary enclosures inside the indoor area of the sheltered housing facility containing 2 Capuchin monkeys had
areas that were rusted. The primary enclosure on the left had flaking, pitted, irregular rust on the bottom and middle
bars of the front panel of the enclosure. The primary enclosure on the right had areas of flaking, pitted, irregular rust
on the metal bar adjacent to the resting platform in that enclosure.
Rusted and pitted surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Rusted areas may harbor organic material and
organisms that cause disease. Rust may weaken the structural integrity of the underlying structure.
