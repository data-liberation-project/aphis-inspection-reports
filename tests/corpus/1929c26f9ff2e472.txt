(b)(2)
Records for a male lion named Robin indicated that he was euthanized by gunshot without prior evaluation by a
licensed veterinarian. His records indicate the attending veterinarian was contacted by phone, she diagnosed
severe ataxia by phone, and approved euthanasia without examining the animal. According to the records this
animal was only 12 to 13 years old and had no prior history of neurologic issues.
The licensee is responsible for ensuring appropriate methods to diagnose and treat illnesses are provided to
resident animals. The licensee is also responsible for ensuring veterinary care will be available for emergencies,
weekends, and holidays. The licensee failed to ensure appropriate care was given to this animal by failing to find
another veterinarian able to visit and examine this lion in person. This lion was euthanized for what might have
been a minor problem that could have been easily resolved if seen by a qualified veterinarian.
The licensee must have a licensed veterinarian evaluate all animals in person prior to euthanasia in order to ensure
all animals are provided with appropriate diagnosis and treatment prior to euthanasia.
To be corrected immediately.

(b)(3)
***** At time of inspection a single housed male lion was observed to be exceptionally thin. His hips, vertebrae, and
ribs were very prominent. The animal was lying on its side and did not stand during this inspection. According to
records this animal is only 8 years old and has had no prior medical problems but he has not been evaluated by a
veterinarian recently. It is the licensee(cid:25)s responsibility to have a trained person evaluating these animals daily and communicating any
concerns with the veterinarian in a timely manner. According to this animal(cid:25)s records there has been no
communication with the attending veterinarian.
The licensee needs to contact the veterinarian and have this animal evaluated.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(a)
*****Adequate experience and knowledge of the species maintained by a facility is required. The general husbandry
practices of feeding and cleaning alone does not demonstrate this. The ability to recognize the required materials
for building enclosures, housing units, enrichment choices, condition of the animals themselves to aid in evaluating
good nutrition, ability to reconize an animal which is not acting as the others which can be an indication of a health
issue so that this can be conveyed to the attending veterinarian are just a few of those that this facility has failed to
show which would demonstrate some of the experience and knowledge which pretains to the species under their
care.
If the facility personnel are not certain of the needs then they should seek out other persons in the same type of
business or similar business such as zoos other individuals who have similar animals. They should be able to
determine the types of materials which would be appropriate or not for use around the animals if they have the
experience and knowledge of the species they are working with.
This facility currently lacks a person of experience and knowledge and needs to incorporate into the facility a plan
for gaining this help from a person that possesses this experience and knowledge on a routine basis or that can
help to educate those personal at the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) ***** At time of inspection the chain-link fabric used for the enclosure located directly west of the leopard enclosure
consisted of several different sized pieces of chain-link fabric. Where the two eight foot sections where joined
together there were several locations which had not been fastened together they were simply overlapping each
other. There were several places where they were not fastened to the posts used to support the construction, At the
top there was no top rail or tension wire which was securely fastened to the posts for supporting the chain link
fabric.
This was the construction of the south wall of this enclosure. The walls of the rest of the enclosure consisted of
chain-link fabric in various sizes with the use of a tension wire along the top which was not attached to the post
supports and in some locations missing entirely.
***** In the enclosure next to this enclosure to the north it was constructed of chain-link fabric and posts with what
was to be considered a 45 degree kick in of chain-link material along the top. The fabric along the top sagged in
many places from having no top support such as a tension wire or top rail. This fails to provide the type of system
that is considered appropriate to maintain the enclosure in good repair and the animal securely within the enclosure
should it decide to attempt to escape.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(b)
***** At time of inspection the concrete block housing units for both the Leopard and Cougar were to narrow and not
long enough to completely protect the cats from the elements and to prevent discomfort from the elements. The cats
had to lay one of two directions only, facing towards the front or rear of the longest measurement of the housing
unit. When facing forward such as the leopard at time of inspection its flanks touched the back wall of the housing
unit while it had its front legs tucked beside its body and its head stuck out of the front of the housing unit. The width
dimension of the housing unit would not allow for either animal to lie, it was far too narrow.
These units had an overhang on the roof which would have been the appropriate length for the housing unit itself to
provide for the protection and comfort of the animals. The width should be of a similar dimension which would allow
for the animals to lay in either direction comfortably.
***** At time of inspection the single housed male lion had been provided with a concrete block housing unit whichmet the provisions that a housing unit should. It was long enough and wide enough to provide protection from the
elements and prevent discomfort to the animal. Ventilation for this unit was provided by the entrance to the housing
unit. The animal had sufficient shade provided so that ventilation was not a factor at this time.
***** At time of inspection the concrete pads that had been poured in the enclosure housing the two tigers and the
enclosure with the three lions were of a size sufficient for one animal only.
When the Director was asked if a housing unit for each animal in the enclosure equivalent to the pad size poured
was to be provided for each animal the answer was no that the pad currently poured was to be the housing unit for
the animals in the enclosure.
After seeing the unit for the single lion the inspector asked the director if the proposed pad size and housing units
would be large enough for all the animals to enter at one time and be provided protection from the elements, could
move about freely, sit, stand and lie in a normal manner the answer was no that they needed to be larger.
These units which are not large enough for all the animals to enter at one time, need to be enlarged or multiple
housing units which can accommodate all animals in the enclosures need to be constructed which will provide
protection of the animals from the elements and prevent discomfort to the animals.
The choice of materials to provide housing for these animals is that of the licensee. That choice also comes with the
requirement to maintain that choice of materials in good repair.

SANITATION.
(a)
***** At time of inspection the leopard pen had remnants of animal fur and skin which had not been removed. During
the summer(cid:25)s hot temperatures and high humidity that is present in this area routine husbandry practices need to
provide for the quick removal of material which leads to the attraction of pests and insects, causes odors and can
lead to disease problems in the facility
***** At time of inspection the enclosure housing two tigers had fecal material which was chalk white to light grey in
appearance which had not been removed during the routine husbandry of the enclosures which should be
occurring. This can lead to pests, odors and disease which can affect the health of the animals at this facility. A
more frequent cleaning of these enclosures need to be incorporated into the standard operating procedures for this
facility.TO BE CORRECTED BY: 8/8/14
