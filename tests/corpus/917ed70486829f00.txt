FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: During this inspection four goats, two sheep and two pigs were inside the
perimeter fence around the enclosures housing the wild and exotic animals. These animals were not inside an
enclosure, but were walking around the animal enclosures. There are areas with chain link fencing coming out of
the ground from the sides of some of the animal enclosures and one area with partially buried chain link fencing that
may be the site of a new enclosure. The animals may injure their legs on the chain link coming up out of the
ground. The protruding chain link must be buried/covered up or the animals kept out of this area for the safety of
the animals.
3.131 REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: Fencing, wood, old enclosures, tires, and miscellaneous items are stored around
the outdoor animal enclosures, food storage area and perimeter fence. All this clutter provides good hiding places
for mammalian pests and prevents vegetation from being cut/trimmed around the enclosure fencing. Animals may
be injured when walking through these areas to move to other enclosures or into the transport trailer. Animal and
food storage areas must be free of clutter and debris to deter pests and for the safety of the animals.
