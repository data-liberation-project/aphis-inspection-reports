INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Several IACUC approved protocols have incomplete descriptions of the proposed use of the animals (animals are
currently in use use on five of the protocols). These protocols have broad descriptions of animal use but few details
are present. The protocol descriptions are vague, containing little to no information regarding the number and timing
of procedures being performed on the animals. Additionally, the procedures themselves are not described in
sufficient detail to allow the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committe (IACUC) to adequately assess if animal use
is in compliance with the Animal Wefare Act.
Complete descriptions of animal use must be included in protocols in order for the IACUC to adequately assess
animal use. The IACUC should ensure that protocols contain a complete description of all animal use prior to
approving those activities.

FEEDING.
Ag Guide: Chapter 3 & 11, page 21, 143
Insects that appeared to be weeviles were observed in the bulk feed receptacle for the pigs and in one bulk food
receptacle for the chickens. The insects were also observed in a container of newly delivered feed intended for
weaned pigs. A staff member at the facility acknowledged that feed from the mill was being delivered with insect
contamination. The IACUC reported the issue in the June and October 2016 semi-annual facility inspections as a
minor deficiency. The IACUC recommendation for correction at those times was only to discard the food and did not
address the source of the infestation despite deficiencies noticed on consecutive IACUC semi-annual inspections.
Contaminants may adversely affect the quality of food and thus may adversely impact animal health and well being.
Food receptacles must be free of contaminants, including insects. The facility should ensure that food is inspectedand found to be free of contamninants prior to being fed to the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
