Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility acquired an Arabian Wolf named “Wolfy” on June 3, 2022. According to facility records, the animal was thin
on arrival, was found to have a swollen face on July 5, 2022, a swollen leg on July 12, 2022, and a “raw” toe was noted on
July 20, 2022. Medical records show communication with the veterinarian has been done via photos, text, and phone
conversation however the veterinarian has not visually assessed the animal in person or performed a physical exam on
the animal.
During this inspection, “Wolfy” was observed to be extremely thin, have an abnormal gait in the rear legs, and an
injury/wound to one of the toes on the left front foot. Treatment for “Wolfy” at this time consists of hydrotherapy for the
toe.
The license is responsible for communicating medical concerns to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner so that
minor medical concerns can be addressed before they become major medical concerns.
“Wolfy” needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian in person and the following medical problems need to be addressed: lack
of weight gain, abnormal gait in the rear legs, old wounds on the face, and the injury to the toe.

Space requirements.
The kinkajou were being temporarily housed in air kennels while the air conditioning in their enclosure was being repaired.
Although the facility was cleaning the kennels daily, kinkajou can create a large amount of waste. One of the animals had
minimal area of uncontaminated space to move in. None of the animals had space to make normal postural adjustments
such as climbing or walking.
Air kennels are not adequate as a primary enclosure for kinkajou, even temporarily. They do not provide adequate space
for normal movements and do not allow the animals to avoid their waste.
Larger temporary housing that provides the kinkajou room to walk and climb needs to be provided for these animals.

Watering.
Water in the pools of many of the animal enclosures was a greenish color due to algae. One had a foul odor due to the
animal using it as a bathroom. Although these are not the primary source of drinking water for the animals, the animals
do drink from them and swim in them therefore the water needs to be kept clean.
Dirty water can cause health problems for the animals and be a breeding ground for insects. The pools need to be
cleaned more frequently to prevent algae growth and foul odors.
