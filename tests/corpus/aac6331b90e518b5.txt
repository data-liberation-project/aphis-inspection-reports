2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female adult grey (“Chinchilla”-colored) rabbit, in cage #13, was observed to be holding her right ear down and shaking
her head periodically. When inspected, the right ear contained dark brown thick debris and scabs which was covering the
inside surface of the ear, affecting one third the length of the ear and filling the base of the ear canal. The skin along the
edges of the debris was red. An employee cleaned and treated the ear in accordance with instructions from the attending
veterinarian, and a copious amount of brown waxy debris was removed from the ear, exposing red skin underneath. An
employee stated that the rabbits’ ears do all get inspected once a month in accordance with the veterinarian’s
instructions, however, this was a new rabbit and only the left ear had been checked when it arrived. The employee had
not observed this ear disease prior to the inspection.
Rabbits with ear disease can suffer from pain, discomfort, or infection.
Correct by providing adequate veterinary care to all rabbits to ensure the prompt identification and treatment of ear
disease.

Facilities, outdoor.

There are three outdoor enclosures, one housing two adult warthogs, one housing an adult male red-river hog, and one
housing an adult female red river hog, which contain a large amount of pooled water and deep mud. The mud and water
completely cover the ground within the enclosures. The only dry areas within the enclosures are inside the elevated
shelter structures. The animals must walk through deep mud in order to access their drinking water, which is available in
an automatic waterer in the corner of each enclosure. On all four animals the mud is caked on their legs and the
underside of their bodies. Also, while watching the male red river hog walk around in its enclosure, the mud was observed
to be as deep as the animal’s chest. An employee stated that it had recently rained and that a drainage trough had been
dug in the area but was not yet working effectively. Enclosures that do not drain effectively and in which the ground is
excessively muddy with no dry path to the water source, can cause animals to develop hoof or skin issues due to
excessive moisture and mud exposure. Mud can also contain bacteria or pathogens that are harmful to the animals.
Correct by ensuring that a suitable method is provided to rapidly eliminate excessive water within animal enclosures, and
ensure that animals can access their drinking water without walking through mud.
