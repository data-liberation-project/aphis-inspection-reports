3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Husky Building" all of the enclosures are constructed of metal fence panels. The metal fence panels of every
enclosure are covered in an excessive amount of rust. The rust does not allow for adequate cleaning and
sanitization of the fence panels which could increase the disease risk towards the dogs. There are at least fifteen
dogs housed in these enclosures.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization,
or that affects the structural strength of the surface. The licensee must replace the fence panels or alter them in a
manner that leaves them free of excessive rust. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of dog enclosures
remain free of excessive rust at all times.
