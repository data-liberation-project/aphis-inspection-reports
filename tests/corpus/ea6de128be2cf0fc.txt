2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Veterinary care issues identified:
* A dead female Italian Grey Hound (#043111029) was discovered in one of the shelters during this inspection.
This animal should be taken to the veterinarian for a necropsy in order to determine the cause of death and make
certain the cause of death is not a threat to the rest of the dogs in the kennel (infectious disease, etc).
* A female Italian Grey Hound with pups in cage #38 had hair loss with areas that appeared slightly reddened on
the front of her neck and chest. This hair loss needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to determine the
cause and an appropriate treatment.
* A shih-tzu in enclosure T9 that had just been groomed had knotted fur on all four feet. Knotted fur can cause
areas of dermatitis underneath the knots that are uncomfortable for the animal. These knots can also cause excess
tension on the skin and be painful. This animal needs to have its feet adequately groomed.
Daily checks to observe the health and well-being of the animals at this facility continue to be a problem. The
licensee or the employees are responsible for checking these animals at least once daily, more often if possible,
and communicating any health concerns to the attending veterinarian immediately. Written records from the
veterinarian confirming dogs with health issues have been examined and documenting diagnosis and treatment
need to be available for review during USDA inspections.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several of the dog enclosures have plastic mesh running along the metal fence panels. The function of this mesh
appears to have been to keep the dogs from sticking their heads through the large holes in the fence panels. Some
of this mesh has been chewed up or pulled loose and is no longer functioning as intended. Facilities must be kept
in good repair to protect the animals from injury, contain the animals and restrict other animals from entering. The
loose, chewed mesh needs to be repaired before a dog swallows a piece or one of the dogs sticks it's head into
another pen and is injured.To be corrected by: June 8, 2015
3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The whelping house had a strong ammonia odor. Based on the odor present in the building the current system was
not operating to sufficiently ventilate the odors. Indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently ventilated at all times to
minimize odors, ammonia levels, and humidity. Excessive ammonia can negatively affect the health of the dogs,
especially the younger pups. The current ventilation system needs to be evaluated and maintained as necessary to
provide sufficient ventilation for the regulated animals.
To be corrected immediately.
3.6(c)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two Italian Grey Hounds, one in cage 36 and one in cage 37, were fighting through the fence. One of the dogs was
able to get a good portion of its body through the holes in the fence. These dogs could seriously injure one
another. The holes in the fence need to be repaired to ensure these dogs cannot have contact with one another. If
the animals continue to exhibit aggression towards each other one of the dogs needs to be relocated to another
enclosure.
To be corrected immediately.
3.9(b) DIRECT
FEEDING.
Moldy feed was identified in 4 dog feeders. Moldy feed can cause serious illness in the dogs. Food must be
uncontaminated and palatable. Food receptacles must be located so as to minimize contamination by excreta,
pests, and weather. They must be checked and cleaned regularly. Measures must be taken to prevent feed from
becoming caked or moldy. This facility needs to establish a more frequent schedule for checking and cleaning
feeders or feed only what the dogs can consume at one feeding and/or use disposable food receptacles.
To be corrected immediately.
