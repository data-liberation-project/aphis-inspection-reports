INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Though the IACUC has met and conducted program reviews and facilities inspections on three occasions (May
2018, November 2018, July 2019) Institutional Official (IO) reports have neither been prepared, reviewed and
signed by a majority of IACUC members, nor submitted to the IO. It is difficult to keep track of departures and
deficiencies, and their corrections, if they are not clearly defined and readily available, such as they would be in an
IO report. Animal welfare may be negatively impacted if a plan for correction of deficiencies is not developed and
followed. Accurate IO reports containing all necessary information must be generated following each program
review and facilities inspection.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC approved protocol 002 describes placement of glucose sensors on the back of swine while restrained in a
sling. However, sensors are actually being placed on the abdomen or belly of the swine. Anesthesia is required to
place sensors in this location. Animals were observed in the individual housing area and lab area with sensors on
their abdomen during inspection. This deviation has not been reviewed or approved by the IACUC. Without IACUC
review, significant protocol changes may involve procedures which could injure or harm the animals in ways not
considered by the investigator or research staff. The IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications (to
secure approval), or withhold approval to all proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in
ongoing activities.

2.31(d)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).The IACUC consists of six members. On protocol 001, an IACUC member is listed as the principal investigator (PI).
On protocol 002, three IACUC members are personally involved in the protocol as PI, research associate, and
animal technician. During the inspection interview process, it was determined that all of the personally involved
IACUC members participated in the review and approval of their protocols. For protocol 002, a quorum could not be
achieved if the members had recused themselves. An unbiased review of protocols is necessary to assure optimal
animal welfare. No IACUC member may participate in the IACUC review or approval of an activity in which that
member has a conflicting interest (e.g., is personally involved in the activity), except to provide information
requested by the IACUC, nor may any member who has a conflicting interest contribute to the constitution of a
quorum.
