***In the Marmoset building, there were three Marmosets (Robby, Penny and Chevis), and one Cottontop Tamarin
(Rotten) that had hair loss on their tails. The Marmosets haircoats had a greasy and matted texture. The licensee stated
that these Marmosets were received in this condition and that they were not under any treatment. According to the
records, these animals were received into the facility on January 14, 2020.
***In the outdoor enclosures, there was one enclosure containing two Fennec Fox being used as a breeding pair. The
male had hair loss on the sides of his neck, lower portion of his back, flanks and hip areas. The licensee stated that this
could be from breeding. The female has a deformed back right leg with no weight bearing as the lower portion of the leg is
pointed upward. The licensee stated that this animal was born in this condition.
The licensee stated that she had discussed these issues with a family member who is a veterinarian and with friends that
work in the zoo industry. The attending veterinarian stated that she was aware of some hair loss on the Marmosets and
the male Fennec Fox from the farm visit three weeks ago, but not the Tamarin or the female Fennec Fox’s situations and
did not realize that the marmosets were received in that condition.
Medical conditions that have not been properly diagnosed by a licensed veterinarian and left untreated can worsen,
increase stress and discomfort for the animals. The licensee must ensure that adequate veterinary care is provided to all

of the animals as required.
All of these animals must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by close of business July 13, 2021. Veterinary
recommendations and treatment plans must be followed.

2.40b3
***As the licensee stated the Marmosets arrived with hair loss and haircoat issues in January of 2020 and the attending
veterinarian not being made aware of this condition until June of 2021, the relay of veterinary care concerns to the
attending veterinarian in a timely and accurate manner has been non-existent for this situation. The lack of
communication between the licensee and the attending veterinarian can lead to worsened conditions due to delayed
diagnosis and treatment. The licensee must ensure that timely and accurate information is relayed to the attending
veterinarian as required.
To be corrected from July 10, 2021 forward.

Outdoor housing facilities.
***In the front of the property, there was an outdoor enclosure that contained two Ruffed Lemurs. The fence that
surrounded the enclosure was less than 6 feet tall. Material has been received to expand the height of the fence
however, it has not been installed yet. The licensee stated that this is not a permanent enclosure, but more of an exercise
enclosure. Non-human primates located in an area without a perimeter fence of required dimensions can increase the risk
of entry to the primary enclosure by animals or humans. The licensee must ensure that all perimeter fences meet the
requirements.
This was corrected as the lemurs were moved to another enclosure during the inspection.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
3.81 Environmental Enhancement
***The environmental enhancement plan exists however, there is no documentation that expresses the approval of
direction by the attending veterinarian and the attending veterinarian could not be reached for varication. Lack of approval
of direction by the attending veterinarian can lead to injury or illness in the animals. The licensee must ensure that the
environmental enhancement plan is under the direction of the attending veterinarian as required.
To be corrected by July 23, 2021.
3.81(a)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
***In the outdoor enclosures, there was a Lars Gibbon that was singly housed. The licensee stated that this was due to
medical issues. The licensee also stated that the attending veterinarian said that the Gibbon could be returned to the
enclosure with other Gibbons. The attending veterinarian verified that three weeks ago the licensee was told that the
Gibbons could be rejoined.
***In the outdoor enclosures, there was a Ruffed Lemur that was singly housed. The licensee stated that the Lemur lost
her mate approximately two months ago and another mate has been selected and awaiting arrival. The attending
veterinarian stated that she was unaware of this. There is no singly housed documentation for either of these non-human
primates at the facility.
Lack of social grouping can increase stress and discomfort and lead to behavioral and/or veterinary care issues. The
licensee must ensure that social grouping is addressed and in accordance with the direction of the attending veterinarian
for all non-human primates as required.

Facilities, general.
***In the back of the property, there was an outdoor enclosure containing two Bat Eared Fox. There was an extension
cord that runs through the enclosure, attached to the side panel, and into the lock out for a fan. The portion of this cord
that is in the enclosure could be reached by the fox. Electrical cords inside of an enclosure increase the risk of injury to
the animals. The licensee must move the cord or place the cord in conduit to keep the animals safe as required.
