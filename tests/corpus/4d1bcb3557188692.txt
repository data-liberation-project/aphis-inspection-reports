2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In June, 2014, Koko, the 43 year old female gorilla, experienced an episode described in her medical record as:
"has not been doing well for the past week- has not been moving much, cannot seem to use legs well, poor
appetite, lethargic." The owner and the attending veterinarian, who is out-of-state, speculated over the
phone/text/email on various causes for her ailments, including stress/psychological and/or arthritis. The vet notes
that the owner declines an immobilization for a full work-up. A pharmaceutical regimen is prescribed, and within the
next few weeks, after adjusting the drug regimen by phone/text/email, Koko improves.
During this episode, where Koko was described as being unwilling to use her legs, and also, according to on-site
records, experiencing reduced function of her left arm, Koko was not examined by a veterinarian. There could have
been many possible, and very serious causes for her sudden decline. Failure to conduct a physical exam put the
animal's well-being at risk.
The exhibitor is expected to establish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of
appropriate methods to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency care. Serious
clinical signs, such as those exhibited by Koko during this time period, should be promptly evaluated by a
veterinarian via examination of the animal on site. If the attending veterinarian is not available, then a local
emergency veterinarian should be consulted, as per the written program of veterinary care.

3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the primary enclosures for the animals the floors and toilets have missing and chipped paint in some areas. Paint
is worn off of walls and window frames. The chain-link fencing in the patio door opening in Koko's enclosure ismissing paint, and has some rust.
Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the
facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled. All surfaces must be
maintained and/or replaced on a regular basis. Items that are worn or potentially hazardous should be discarded.
Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces and items in the enclosure can impede cleaning, create hazards, and
otherwise put the health and well-being of the animals at risk.
