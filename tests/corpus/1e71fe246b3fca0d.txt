3.50(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four rabbits escaped from their enclosure approximately two weeks ago and were never recovered as per the
facility owner. The rabbits were able to dig underneath the enclosure fence and escape as per the facility owner.
The escaped rabbits could fall prey to predators as the facility is in a rural location.
Assure that the rabbit enclosure is maintained so that rabbits can't escape.
To be corrected: From this day forward.

WATERING.
DIRECT
Sixteen pigs did not have access to water and drank voraciously after it was provided to them. The sixteen pigs are
housed in four stalls (four pigs per stall) inside of the racing pig building. Each of the stalls contains a large PVC
tube with a Lixit valve attached near the bottom. These are the pigs’ water receptacles. None of the tubes
contained water. The tubes were filled with water at my request. Each of the sixteen pigs began to push each other
and fight for control of the water. At least one stall of pigs was observed drinking voraciously for two minutes. This
would indicate that the pigs were not provided enough water or that they were not provided with water often enough.

The pigs must be provided with water as often as necessary to provide for their health and comfort.
To be corrected: This was corrected during the time of inspection as the pigs were offered water.
Ensure that this is corrected from this day forward.
NON DIRECTSeven water receptacles were dirty, had excessive debris, and/or had algae buildup in them during the time of
inspection. The first water tub was located within the enclosure containing the twelve goats, four sheep, and one
alpaca. The inside walls of the water tub were coated with green algae. The second tub was located in the barn
stall with the two goats. It contained feces, hay, and other excessive debris. The third tub was located in the single
cow's enclosure. The bottom of the water tub was coated with green algae. The final four were located in the pigs'
stalls. The inside of each tube had large amounts of black and brown material on them.
Consuming water with these contaminants could make the animals ill.
Clean these water receptacles and repeat often enough to assure that animals have access to clean water.

SANITATION.
Excessive feces and flies were present in the stall containing the two Holstein calves during the time of inspection.
At least 2/3 of the stall contained soiled straw. Numerous flies were observed in the feces and in the calves food
dish. Excessive feces attracts flies and can cause animal diseases.
Clean the stall and repeat often enough to prevent excessive build up of feces.
To be corrected: 9-30-16
Approximately 1/4 of an inch of wet feces covered all four of the pig stalls. The feces completely covered the
concrete stall floors and covered the majority of the stall walls. The stalls were flushed with water by the license
holder during the inspection; however, this left one of the stalls with with significant standing water. It also left all of
the other stalls with only wet concrete. Excessive feces and standing water can cause health problems in pigs.
Ensure the pig stalls are kept clean by removing feces often enough to prevent build up. The pigs must also have a
dry, clean place within their stalls to lie down.
