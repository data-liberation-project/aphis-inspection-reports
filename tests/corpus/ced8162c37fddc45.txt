2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male Chihuahua (DOB 2009, microchip #4653A1B1F) has a heavy buildup of brown tartar on the upper and lower
canine teeth. The brown tartar is covering the majority of the surface of the teeth and the gums are slightly
reddened. Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort as well as lead to further health issues.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment
plan. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At least sixteen enclosures, containing a total of at least thirty-three adult large and small breed dogs, have an
excessive buildup of feces. In at least three of the small breed dog enclosures the feces are located throughout the
entire outdoor floor space. The licensee stated that the enclosures had not been cleaned in a few days due to the
cold temperatures, but planned to clean them the next day. A buildup of feces could cause the dogs to become
soiled and increase the risk of health hazards.
Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily to prevent accumulation of excreta
and disease hazards. The licensee must remove all feces and waste from the enclosures and must continue to
remove them daily in order to reduce the disease risk towards the dogs.
Correction date: Enclosures must be spot-cleaned daily from this day forward.
