Enclosure for Tiger, Miley: There was an approximately 1.5ft X 2ft section of chain link fencing within contact of the
animal which had a thick-coated, yellowish-brown, buildup of animal urine waste, hair and organic debris.
Animal waste and organic debris must be removed as often as necessary to prevent potential contamination of the
animals contained and to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors.
The cleaning schedule of the enclosures must be more effective to prevent the buildup of animal waste to ensure
the health and well-being of the animals.
