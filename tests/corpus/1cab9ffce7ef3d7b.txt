2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In a guinea pig room, a collection of un-labeled and un-capped blunt tipped syringes with an unknown substance
was identified on a table. The facility representatives described that these syringes were in use by the contract
research organization to flush the indwelling cannulae in the covered species, but the CRO staff was out for lunch.
Syringes should be labeled and stored in a manner which minimizes its potential to be misused and to prevent
contamination.
Each research facility should establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
Correct for all future inspections.
This was a focused inspection of the animal facilities at this site.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on 26 August, 2016.
