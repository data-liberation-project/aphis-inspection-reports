The week of February 7th ,facility records indicate 2 red kangaroos ( Charlie and Sherman ) were found dead in their
enclosure. The applicant stated to the inspector that her pet German Shepherd likely entered an adjacent enclosure thru a
gate left open by children and found a hole in the fence line of the kangaroo enclosure and chased them . This enclosure
now houses 1 sheep . A metal panel has been placed over the bottom section of the hole in the fence but there is an open
area at the top that would allow entrance of unwanted animals .Enclosures must be maintained structurally strong and in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them .

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The transport enclosure used for the sloth is a wooden box with a lid that is secured with a bungee cord. The top of the
box can easily be lifted creating an area for escape . Recently, the sloth was transported to an event and escaped by
pushing on the top of the box and was loose on the floor board of the vehicle. A loose animal in a vehicle is a danger for
both the animal and the driver. Transport enclosures must be structurally strong enough to contain the animal. The
transport box for the sloth must be repaired or replaced to safely contain the animal.
