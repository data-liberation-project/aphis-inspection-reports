INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC meetings are conducted twice a year. Upon review of the minutes for the semiannual meeting of January
2016 there was no information or reference to a facility inspection found in the report. It was determined that during
this period the facility was transitioning and no "official" facility inspection was conducted as required. As a result
the facility was not officially inspected for a 12 month period. The IACUC is required to inspect all animal facilities
every 6 months. With the most recent facility inspection being conducted in June 2016 the next will be due by
December 2016.
The IACUC shall inspect all animal facilities and document the inspection no less than semi-annually as required.
Correct by December 2016.

Interior Surfaces. In building 12 there is a wooden baseboard running along the floor on the right side of the room
near the front of the first section. The wood has chipping and peeling paint and appears to be rotten. This wood
cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
All interior building surfaces shall be maintained so they are substantially impervious to moisture.

SANITATION.
Housekeeping. In building 11 in the rabbit room there are accumulations of dust on the pipes and overhead
structures running along the ceiling. The dust may fall or be blown into the rabbit food or enclosures potentially
causing contamination. The current schedule for cleaning and maintaining the room is insufficient to prevent such
accumulations.The overhead structures shall be cleaned at a frequency that will prevent such accumulations and protect the
rabbits from contamination. Correct by September 30, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Plant Manager, QMRC Manager, Compliance specialist
and Facility Manager.
