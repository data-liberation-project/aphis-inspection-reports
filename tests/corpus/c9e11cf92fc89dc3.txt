HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A plastic covered bucket containing primate food intended for the marmosets contained dirt and debris mixed in with
the biscuits. The owner stated that those were fresh biscuits but that he had just picked them up after he
accidentally spilled them on the ground. An open bag of dry primate food was not stored in a leakproof container
with a tightly fitting lid to prevent spoilage and contamination. Feeding food that has been contaminated with dirt,
debris or other material could cause illness in the monkeys. Food must be stored and handled in a manner that
protects it from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an accumulation of dried and decaying food and fecal waste in several enclosures housing marmosets.
Multiple marmoset enclosures had perches, toys, and other surfaces in the cages that were dirty and/or with dark
greasy appearing staining. Some walls were also dirty and had flaking and worn paint and wood that was
deteriorating. Some food receptacle holders/access portals were very rusted. Soiled surfaces and accumulation of
food and fecal waste may cause a risk of diseases, odor accumulation, or pest infestation that could affect the
health and well-being of the animals. Rusted or deteriorating surfaces cannot be completely cleaned. Food and
excrement must be removed more frequently, and as often as necessary to prevent excessive waste accumulation,
pest infestation, and disease hazards. Surfaces must be kept clean and replaced when worn.3.130

SANITATION.
Several primary enclosures for the kinkajous were dirty with accumulations of feces and food wastes. There was an
odor of decaying food coming from one kinkajou pen. Excreta and discarded food debris must be removed from
primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein, to avoid
attracting pests and to minimize disease hazards.
