3.137(a)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
There were thirteen enclosures each with one hedgehog which did not have adequate ventilation (#4321-4333).
There were several holes in the lids of the containers but no ventilation openings on the sides. There was also
concern that if these containers were stacked when moving them that the vent holes in the lids would be blocked.
Inadequate ventilation could cause distress, asphyxiation and death of the animals.
Correct from this point forward.
This inspection was conducted on June 2nd and 3rd, 2017.
The exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
