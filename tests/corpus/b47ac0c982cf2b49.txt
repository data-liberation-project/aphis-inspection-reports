2.126(b)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:15pm-2:45pm on
8-3-21.

I texted and called the licensee's contact number, knocked on the facility door, and honked the vehicle horn in an attempt
to reach the licensee. All attempts were unsuccessful. I waited at the facility for 30 minutes and left.
