ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:17 pm on
08-OCT-19.
On Tuesday October 7, at 2:17 pm, no responsible adult was available for inspection during optimum hours. After
finding no one at the kennel I called and spoke briefly with the facility representative who said that she was out of
town. The call was ended abruptly due to poor reception so I waited a total of 30 minutes and left at 2:47 pm.
