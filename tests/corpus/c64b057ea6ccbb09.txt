3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A fox named Lightfoot was in the exercise garden when it was identified by the staff that an injury had occurred.
Lightfoot was immediately taken to the Attending Veterinarian’s clinic where the leg was identified as broken. An
amputation of the front left leg was performed. During this inspection it was observed that Lightfoot’s surgery has
healed well and Lightfoot’s mobility was good.
The enclosure for the fox led to a serious injury in the animal. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and in
good repair to protect the animals from injury. A routine review of the enclosure must occur to identify potential
areas of injury and measures taken to correct these.
Correct from this day forward.
