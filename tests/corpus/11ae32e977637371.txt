3.1(b) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The alley-way of Whelping Kennel Building had an accumulation or two piles of soiled shredded paper bedding
and fecal waste located closely to an enclosure housing puppies.
This can attract vermin, pests and other rodents as well as provide living and breeding areas for them. As a result,
this could increase the disease hazards and affect the health for the eight puppies.
For the prevention of disease hazards, vermin, pests and other rodents, all housing facilities (alley-ways) must be
free and clean of accumulations of soiled shredded paper bedding, fecal waste and other waste.
3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Several enclosures, all housing 10 adult dogs, have wood support posts that support the divider panels. These
wood support post are covered with metal around the outside. The surfaces for the bottom portion of these metal
covered posts are excessively rusty, flaking and corroded away.
* Two enclosures, all housing seven adult dogs, have metal poles used to support the panel dividers. These metal
pole dividers are excessively rusty and pitting.
These surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized, thus increasing the disease potential. The structural
strength of the surfaces is affected.
To maintain the structural strength and for proper cleaning and sanitization, all metal surfaces must be kept free of
rust. This will decrease the disease potential and ensure the metal surfaces are structurally sound. 3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The end enclosure, housing four adult dogs, of the Main Kennel has an wood board on the wall and a corner
board that is excessively chewed and scratched. This excessively chewed and scratched areas are exposing bare
wood and does not allow the surface to be properly cleaned and sanitized.
* Two enclosures, both housing four adult dogs, have metal along their back walls. This metal is chewed and or
corroded away exposing bare wood that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized.
For required cleaning and sanitation and for the prevention of disease hazards, these mentioned surfaces must be
replaced or repaired.
3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The back metal wall inside the main kennel has an sharp jagged edge for one enclosure. This jagged edge is
above the dog door and the metal is chewed off exposing an area of bare wood.
* The back metal wall outside the main kennel has an sharp jagged edge for one enclosure. This jagged edge is
along the bottom where the concrete and wall meet by the dog door. This jagged edge is also protruding into the
enclosure.
These jagged sharp edges could potentially injure the three adult dogs that are housed in both enclosures.
For the prevention of injury to the dogs, all enclosures must be free and maintained of sharp points and sharp
jagged edges.
