2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee was missing paperwork for at least one fox that had been sold in the past six months. In addition, the
licensee's current inventory was not up-to-date. Not properly keeping sales records or maintaining an up-to-date
inventory does not allow for proper tracking of the animals by an APHIS official. All sales records must be kept for
one year after the animal leaves the facility. The inventory must be updated as animals enter or leave the facility.
Correct immediately.
2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During inspection the licensee informed me that one of her foxes ("Notchi", a silver and white male born April 2016)
had escaped from her while she was walking it on January 1st, 2017. As of the time of inspection, the licensee had
not captured the fox. A fox that escapes from the control of the licensee is at risk of being preyed upon by other
animals. In addition, the fox may not have the skill set to survive on its own when it is not under control of the
licensee. The licensee must ensure that the foxes have no means of escaping from the licensee's control. Correct
immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
