Facilities, outdoor.
There are 3 camels that are being kept in a fenced pasture that does not contain any natural or artificial shade structures
for the animals to get out of the direct rays of the sun. The animals have had no shade source provided since June 2020
when they were put out on the pasture for public exhibition. The average temperatures over the 3 months ranged 76-94
deg F, with the average humidity ranging 76% to 94% (weather underground).

There are two smaller pastures with 18 goats and one with 7 sheep that do have a shelter, however they do not have
additional shade available by natural or artificial means. The shelter with the 18 goats is not large enough for all of the
animals to get into for shade without being overcrowded, and preventing natural bodily movements in a way to prevent
overheating or discomfort.

The lack of shade for regulated animals that cannot get out of the heat or from under the direct rays of the sun can cause
serious health issues including physical and behavioral stress or death.

The licensee must provide shade of natural or artificial means to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves
from direct sunlight.

Facilities, outdoor.
For the past three months, there has been no shelter provided for the 3 camels to allow for them to get out of inclement
weather. There are no trees, buildings or structures that are available for the animals to get into during inclement weather
or out of the heat of the day. While there is a barn next to the pasture, the doors to allow the camels in have been sealed
shut with wood preventing them from entering the shelter. The animals have been denied this shelter since the beginning
of the drive through exhibition which started mid-June 2020 until during the time of this inspection.

The lack of a shelter by natural or artificial means, to protect the animals from inclement weather or from the heat of the
day can be a source of discomfort and stress. The lack of proper shelter can cause serious health issues and death if the
weather is severe due to overheating, lightening or strong winds with debris.

The licensee must provide natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species kept
outdoors to afford them protection and prevent discomfort.

Facilities, outdoor.
There is a 30 ft section of perimeter fence in the wooded area going up the hill that had four areas where the fence was
raised 5-8 inches high. The bottom of the fencing is loose enough to allow it to be pushed in either direction allowing an

animal to get under the fence, including coyote or dog-sized animals. This area is holding multiple free roaming species
including zebus, fallow deer, blackbuck, watusi, nilgai, eland, aoudad, cattle, buffalo, scimitar oryx, llama, alpacas, and
water buffalo. There have been two deaths of black buck in the veld area due to an unknown predator that is suspected
to be a coyote. A dead blackbuck was found on June 14, 2020 and on September 11, 2020.

Loose fencing can provide access for predators or other animals to get into the primary enclosure and chase or attack the
animals, resulting in stress, injuries, and possible death.

The licensee must ensure that the perimeter fence is maintained to provide protection for the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the
facility.

Facilities, general.
-There were two areas at the bottom of the fence in the kangaroo area near the barn door where there are broken wires
poking inside of the enclosure allowing direct contact with the animals. Broken wires in fencing can be a source of injury.

-The kangaroo perimeter fence is only 5ft in height and is very wobbly in nature. On August 8, 2020 a kangaroo ‘Perth’
escaped over the fence during a public feeding encounter and left the property for two days until found.

Fenced areas that are too short to contain the regulated animals can provide a mode of escape or entry of animals or

unauthorized people into the primary enclosure.

All indoor and outdoor housing shall be structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals. And must be constructed of such materials and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved.

Handling of animals.
During the inspection a young child was observed climbing onto the fence at the camel feeding area, which was not
attended by a keeper. While the child climbed the fence, he reached over to pet the camel and hung on the fence in direct
face to face contact with the camel. There was no barrier or distance, or identifiable keeper nearby to protect the child
from injury.

The lack of attendants at an animal encounter/feeding where the animal can have direct contact with the public could be a
potential for injury to the person or animal.

The facility must have an attendant present during any public feeding or encounter where the animal can have direct
contact with the person. If there are no attendants, then a barrier and/or sufficient distance should be in place to prevent
the public from being able to have direct contact with the animals.

2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There are multiple animals that are missing on the inventory of the facility. The facility representatives advised there have
been animals that have been born, died, euthanized and sold that have no corresponding records.

The lack of records does not allow for proper management and traceability of regulated animals.

The licensee must keep records on all animals owned, leased, held or otherwise acquired or which is transported, sold,
euthanized or otherwise disposed of. They shall include any offspring born of any animal while in the licensees’
possession or under their control.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
May 13, 2020 three eland escaped from the barn and were loose on the grounds of the facility. The employee responsible
for darting animals advised that he received the drugs for the tranquilizer darts from the attending veterinarian who was
present during the darting incident. He stated the veterinarian advised him what to do. The first eland was darted and
taken to the barn, the second eland(M) was darted and ran into the fenced pasture followed by the remaining female. The
employee stated that the female was running into the fence, panicking and he decided to try to dart her to prevent her
from hurting herself. The dart missed, and the animal continued panicking until she ran into a fence post and broke her
neck. The employee stated that the attending veterinarian was present during the incident and told them to try and dart
the panicking eland.


After contacted by the USDA, the attending veterinarian advised that he was not present during the darting, and only
knew the facility had an escaped eland and came to the clinic to pick up the tranquilizer drugs in the late afternoon. The
veterinarian was not advised about the darting incident and stated he would not have approved darting a panicked animal
that was already contained in a fenced pasture. According to the attending veterinarian, he had not been consulted about
the incident.

If appropriate methods are not being used to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries of the animals it
can lead to unnecessary pain, discomfort or death.

The attending veterinarian must have appropriate authority for all animal care and use. Direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian is required to provide timely and accurate information to the attending vet.

Handling of animals.
On February 5, 2020, according to facility staff present, a staff member (at the time) was advised to euthanize a llama by
gunshot due to illness. However the decision was made by this employee to transport the llama (while alive according to
staff members) to the burial site in an unapproved and inappropriate manner.

When contacted by the USDA, the primary care veterinarian advised he was not consulted about the method of transport
to the burial site that was used. The attending veterinarian advised if he had been contacted, he would have had the
animal euthanized at its location. However the facility chose a method of transport to the burial site that caused undue

trauma, behavioral stress and unnecessary discomfort to the llama before death, and therefore did not comply with
Section 2.131(b)(1). This section requires that handling of all animals be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible
in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, behavioral stress or unnecessary discomfort to the animal
