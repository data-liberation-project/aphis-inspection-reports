ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 on
16-Jan-18.Upon arrival, I spoke with the licensee who was leaving the area for an appointment and was not able to
stay for the inspection process. We discussed future hours of availability.
This is the first attempted inspection.
