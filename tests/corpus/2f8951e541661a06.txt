2.31(b)(3)(ii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The non-affiliated member of the IACUC has attended none of the 5 IACUC meetings that have occurred since October,
2020. The non-affiliated person did participate in a semi-annual review in 2020 and is anticipated to be present at the
next meeting. The lack of an active non-affiliated person serving as an IACUC member as required compromises the
Secretary's intent that such person provide representation for general community interests in the proper care and
treatment of animals. Per the regulations, at least one member of the IACUC shall not be affiliated in any way with the
facility other than as a member of the Committee. Correct by March 25, 2022.
2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The protocol in use does not contain a complete description of two important categories. The protocol is missing the
referenced Annex A that provides a description of the complete approved drug list to be used with the animals. The
protocol is missing the referenced Annex B, which provides the description of the qualifications of the personnel
conducting the described procedures with the species being studied. Incomplete documentation of proposed activities in a
protocol can lead to miscommunications among personnel and may result in harm to the animal. Per the regulations, a
complete description of the proposed use of the animals is required. Correct by March 25, 2022.
