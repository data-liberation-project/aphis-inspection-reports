Exercise for dogs.
A written document of an exercise plan approved by the attending veterinarian was not available at the time of inspection
for the two wolf-dog hybrids. A documented and approved exercise plan helps ensure that a dogs' space requirements
and exercise needs have been considered and will be provided. The facility must develop, document, and follow an
appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. In addition, the plan must be approved by the attending
veterinarian. The plan must include written standard procedures to be followed in providing the opportunity for exercise.
