FACILITIES, INDOOR.
A strong ammonia odor was present in the room housing rabbits. Large amounts of urine could be seen in the trays
under the enclosures. High levels of ammonia may cause discomfort and may adversely affect the health of the
animals. The facility should ensure that animal housing is adequately ventilated.

3.55 REPEAT
WATERING.
Two rabbits did not have water at the time of the inspection (approximately 14:00 hrs). One partially full water bottle
appeared to have fallen off a lower enclosure. The rabbit did not drink when the bottle was replaced. Two empty
water bottles were hanging on a second enclosure. The second rabbit drank vigorously when offered water. A daily
check list for the rabbits noted that a caretaker had fed and watered for the day, so it was possible that the two
rabbits would have been without water until the following day.
Insufficient water may cause discomfort to animals and adversely affect their health. The facility should ensure that
the animals are provided with sufficient water..
Previous correction date: Correct by the end of the day of inspection.3.56(c)
SANITATION.
Fecal matter was observed on the floor of the room housing rabbits. Debris was observed around a floor drain in the
room and in the hallway adjacent to the room.
Accumulations of feces and waste material in, and adjacent to, rooms housing animals may lead to vermin
infestations, the proliferation of infectious organisms that cause disease, and the production of noxious odors. The
facility should ensure that the premises are kept clean and in good repair.
