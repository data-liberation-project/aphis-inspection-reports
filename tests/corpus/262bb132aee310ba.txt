INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The last semi-annual review was conducted on June 17, 2015. According to the facility representative, during a
period of time in June 2015, there was not an Attending Veterinarian (AV) appointed to the IACUC by the Chief
Executive Officer (CEO). The IACUC membership should include a Chairman and at least two additional members,
of which at least one should be an AV, to be a functioning committee. The IACUC is necessary to review and
approve the proposed activities for the care and use of animals and to provide the proper oversight of the use of
animals by the research facility. During the time period mentioned above, semi-annual reviews and any other
IACUC actions were not valid. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure a functional committee is in
place at all times.
The facility has corrected this deficiency

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
At the June 17, 2015 semi-annual review, the committee was not functional since they did not have an appointed
attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian member is one of three required members of the IACUC and is a
pivotal member as this person ensures the proper care and treatment of animals. The required members, including
the attending veterinarian, should be in attendance at most meetings to ensure that the IACUC is fully constituted. A
system should be in place and maintained to ensure a functional committee is in place at all times.

The facility has corrected this deficiency. However, the semi-annual review still needs to be done. To be corrected

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The surgery suite which is used for survival surgeries on swine is not being maintained appropriately. The following
was noted during inspection:
-The surgery suite stores 3 office desks/tables. There are two cloth office chairs and two vinyl type office chairs with
tears. These chairs cannot be sanitized as required.
-Two wooden surgery tables have laminate covering that is peeling off or missing on the legs, table base, and other
areas. These surfaces are not impervious to moisture and should be replaced.
-There are two old metal shelving systems that are used to hold monitors. These shelves are rusted and in
disrepair.
These monitors are not being used for the surgical procedures and should be removed.
-There is a desk with a computer monitor and keyboard/mouse. The laminate on the legs of the desk is starting to
peal. The laminate should be repaired or replaced to allow the required cleaning and sanitizing.
-There is an overhead heat lamp with electrical outlet chord patched together with surgical tape. To eliminate the
electrical hazard, the electrical cord is to be properly repaired or lamp removed. In the back of some of the
monitoring equipment, there are exposed bare wires and connections. This presents an electrical hazard and is not
sanitizable.
-The shelf at the bottom of the trachea suction stand is heavily rusted and is not sanitizable.
Failure to provide an appropriate environment for surgical procedures could be detrimental to the health and
wellbeing of the animals. Appropriate facilities should be available and maintained appropriately for aseptic
procedures, such as those performed at the facility. The facility should ensure that steps are taken to maintain the
surgery suite in an appropriate condition.To be corrected before any surgery is conducted or by 9/20/2015

The lights in the Pharmacy closet do not work. Medical materials used on covered species are stored in this area
and access to them should be readily available if needed. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure
physical plant issues are identified and corrected in a timely manner in order to protect the animals..
