Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:35 PM on 8/25/21.
I called the licensee's cell phone, honked the vehicle horn, and waited at the facility for 30 minutes in attempts to contact
the licensee. All attempts were unsuccessful. I was able to speak to the new property owner and was informed that there
are no longer animal facilities on the property and the licensee is no longer allowed on the property.
