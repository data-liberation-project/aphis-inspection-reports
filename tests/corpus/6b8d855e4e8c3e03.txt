2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Multiple dogs have not been given their prescribed antibiotics after their dental cleanings and extractions. At least 9
bottles of half to nearly full liquid clindamycin were in the medical supply months after they were prescribed. The
prescription labels stated to give until gone and were prescribed between September and December 2022. The licensee
stated that they stopped giving the medications once the dogs started eating again after their dentals. A phone call with
the Attending Veterinarian revealed that he did not authorize stopping the antibiotics. The use of medications such as
antibiotics after surgery can prevent disease such as abscesses and complications can arise when not used as
prescribed. The licensee must maintain adequate veterinary care by using appropriate methods to prevent disease.
Correct from this day forward.
3.6(a)(2)(i) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Several primary enclosures containing dogs had broken wires and sharp points projecting inward. In the whelping
building, two enclosures containing 3 dogs had broken wire flooring that the dogs could step on. Emma, a pregnant
Papillon, was housed in an enclosure with an approximately 2" wire protruding from the floor. Two Yorkshire Terriers, a
male named Beau Jangles and a female named Grace, were housed in an enclosure with 2 broken wires approximately


1/2" in length protruding straight up from the floor. In the big dog kennel, wire is used to attach panels to posts. In 2
enclosures containing 4 dogs there was wire protruding into the kennels. Two Yorkshire Terriers, a male named Banjo
and a female named River Rose were housed in an enclosure with multiple wires ranging in 1" to 2" protruding into the
kennel at head height when the dogs stood up against the wall to play with their neighbors. Two Yorkshire Terriers, a
male named Jax and female named Dusty were housed in an enclosure with a 3-4" wire protruding just above head
height when the dogs stood flat on the ground. Sharp points can cause skin lacerations and eye injuries. Primary
enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure dogs.
3.6(a)(2)(ii) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
In the whelping building, 3 primary enclosure containing 4 dogs had broken flooring, creating holes large enough for feet
to fall through or become entrapped. One enclosure, containing Terri, a pregnant Papillon, had a hole that was
approximately 3” x 1.5”. A female Yorkie named Gigi was in an enclosure with 2 holes approximately 1" x 2". Two yorkies,
a male named Beau Jangles and a female named Grace were housed together in an enclosure with a hole measuring 2"
x 1". Wire flooring in disrepair can cause injury to dogs if their feet fall through. Primary enclosures must be constructed
and maintained so that they protect the dogs from injury.
