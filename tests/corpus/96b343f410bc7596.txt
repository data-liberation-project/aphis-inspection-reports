2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is adding a product called Vi-tal to the water for the rabbits. This treatment is not listed and approved
by the attending veterinarian on the approved written Program of Veterinary Care plan. Since there is no written
documentation regarding this treatment, it can not be determined whether the attending veterinarian has been given
appropriate authority for the provisions of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of
animal care being provided. This may lead to failure to deliver adequate veterinary care to the animals. The licensee
must consult with the attending veterinarian regarding all treatments given to the animals to ensure they are
appropriate and ensure the attending veterinarian is given appropriate authority and oversight over the care of the
animals. All treatments must be included in writing as part of the written Program of Veterinary Care and approved
by the attending veterinarian. Correct by April 5, 2016.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male beige chinchilla needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The left eye was observed to only open
half way and the animal kept the eye in a squinted position. This eye issue has not been evaluated by the attending
veterinarian for diagnosis and recommended course of action. The eye issue may be causing discomfort to the
chinchilla or lead to other more serious issues, if left unaddressed. The licensee must have this animal evaluated by
a veterinarian for diagnosis and recommended treatment. Documentation must be maintained regarding this
veterinary evaulation and kept by the licensee for review by APHIS officials on subsequent inspections. Correct by
March 29, 2016.

*7 chinchillas present on this inspection with no record of acquisition.
*One record that says 4 hedgehogs dated 3/4/16 that includes the name of a person and city and state but does not
indicate whether this is an acquisition or disposition record. The complete address of the person is not recorded on
the record. If this is an acquisition record, it also does not contain the driver's license number and state and vehicle
license number and state of the individual.
*There are a few other records that consist of Mapquest printouts with a street address, city and state but no other
information to determine what type of record it is (disposition or acquisition of animals). Additionally, there is no
indication as to the number and species of animals and date of transaction.
Incomplete records do not allow for tracking of the animals, ensuring that they came from licensed, or exempt from
licensing sources, and does not allow for monitoring of mortality. The licensee must develop and maintain complete
and up-to-date records that contain all required information.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and along with Kevin Wilken, ACI.
