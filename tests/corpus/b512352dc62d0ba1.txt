ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
On inspection, a white and black spotted adult rabbit located in the (cid:28)rabbit barn(cid:29) appeared to have a broken leg. The
staff was aware of the injury, but the rabbit was not treated and was not seen by a veterinarian. The owner stated
the previous veterinarian was contacted about the broken leg and the veterinarian told him not to do anything. The
previous veterinarian was contacted to verify this. The previous attending veterinarian stated he doesn(cid:25)t remember
ever being contacted about a rabbit(cid:25)s leg injury. The previous veterinarian never saw any rabbits from the facility
and only remembers being contacted for instructions in drawing blood from the rabbits. According to staff the leg
was broken several months ago and allowed to heal without any treatment or pain control. Injuries, especially this
serious, have a significant amount of pain and negatively impact the animal welfare and comfort. Animals with
injuries or diseases must receive appropriate methods to diagnose and adequately treat diseases in a timely
manner. At the time of the exit interview the attending veterinarian arrived and euthanized the rabbit. He concluded
it was a broken leg that healed incorrectly. Corrected at time of exit.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
On inspection the rabbit mentioned above appeared to have a broken leg, but it was not communicated to a
veterinarian. Failure to report injuries to a veterinarian results in injuries not being treated in a timely manner and
can result in the further progression of the injury. A broken bone can become infected or heal incorrectly which may
result in chronic pain and the lack of function in that limb. Provide an accurate and timely means of communication
so that all problems for all animals are reported to a veterinarian. Correct this day forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A white and black-spotted adult rabbit was found on inspection that appeared to have a broken right rear leg. The
right hind leg was lying in abnormal position. Instead of being normally tuck under the rabbit, the right hind foot and
part of the leg was positioned away from underneath the rabbit. The other 3 legs appeared normal. The staff said
they were aware of the injury. According to staff the leg must have gotten caught in the wire caging. The black wire
enclosure had 4in by 1in spacing around the sides at the bottom of the enclosure which is large enough for therabbit(cid:25)s foot and leg to get caught in. The other 15 rabbit enclosures had similar cages. There was no identification
of the rabbit or cage number. The rabbit was located on the second level of cages in the (cid:28)rabbit barn(cid:29). Wire cages
that having spacing large enough for a foot or leg to get caught in puts the animals at risk for injuries which was
demonstrated in this rabbit. At the time of the exit interview the attending veterinarian arrived and euthanized the
rabbit. He concluded it was a broken leg and had healed incorrectly. Correct by ensuring all rabbit cages are
constructed that protects the rabbit(cid:25)s feet and legs from injury. Corrected at time of exit.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
It was determined that 180 goats were housed in a manner that did not protect them from the cold weather. The
goats were housed in two pastures that were connected to a barn. The stalls inside the barn had no bedding and
did not provide a wind-break for the animals. According to the owner the reason for the lack of bedding was due to
cleaning the night before and that bedding was going to be put in that day. There was a tarp in one of the stalls but
it did not adequately provide a windbreak and was only available to half of the animals. The majority of the goats
were observed huddled together and shivering. Numerous goats had varying degrees of nasal discharge. According
to the temperature gun, it was 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit inside the barn with a light wind. Snow covered the pasture.
Animals need to be housed in a manner to prevent discomfort and stress. Cold stress severely decreases the
immune system of goats and can contribute to respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Correct by ensuring the
goats are housed in a manner to prevent discomfort. The owner says there will be an effective wind-break put in
place that all animals will have access to later that day. Bedding was provided to the goats at the time of inspection.
Continue to monitor the goats for cold stress and provide an effective means that prevents the discomfort of the
animals. Corrected at time of exit.
This is a focus inspection of the direct non-compliances.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and multiple representatives of the facility.
