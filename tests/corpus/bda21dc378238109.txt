ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 3 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian.
In pen 22, there was a tricolor newborn guinea pig housed with 13 other guinea pigs. The newborn was lethargic
and minimally responsive with sunken eyes that were crusted shut and the hair around the eye was wet with a clear
discharge. The animal was observed to be sitting in one position and not moving and exhibited limited reaction to
being handled or when approached by other guinea pigs in the pen. In addition, the animal appeared to be
breathing with increased respiratory rate and effort.
In pen 56, there was a tricolor weanling with an eye abnormality. The right eye had a white cloudy film covering the
majority of the surface of the eye.
In pen 8, there was a white and gray newborn with an eye abnormality. The left eye was swollen and crusted shut.
The hair around the eye was wet with a clear discharge.
Also, there was a dead newborn embedded in the bedding of the enclosure in pen 12.
The licensee had not contacted the attending veterinarian regarding these guinea pigs and was not administering
any treatments.
Newborns that are lethargic and depressed with respiratory issues can rapidly worsen if not evaluated and treated.
Eye abnormalities can affect the vision, can be indicative of disease or injury, can be painful, and affect the overall
health and well-being of the animal. Failure to identify and treat health conditions can lead to worsening of the
condition including death.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an
appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.

2.40(b)(4) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility is utilizing a method of euthanasia for guinea pigs that is not included in the Program of Veterinary Care.
The Program of Veterinary Care specifies that euthanasia is to be performed by the veterinarian using
pentobarbital. However, the facility is performing its own euthanasia by blunt force trauma. This method does notmeet the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Act which requires euthanasia to be performed by a method that
produces rapid unconsciousness and subsequent death without evidence of pain or distress, or a method that
utilizes anesthesia produced by an agent that causes painless loss of consciousness and subsequent death. They
were unsure of how many guinea pigs were euthanized this way but said it may have been as many as five animals
in the last 6 months. The attending veterinarian was contacted and was not comfortable with the way the facility
was performing euthanasia and stated that the facility should be contacting him if animals need to be euthanized.
Failure to utilize a method of euthanasia consistent with the attending veterinarian’s guidance and according to the
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act is likely to result in unnecessary pain and suffering to the animals.
The facility must utilize a method of euthanasia approved by their attending veterinarian and that complies with the
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility’s disposition records are incomplete. The sales slips do not include the name and address of the dealer
or person to whom the guinea pigs are being sold.
Failure to maintain sales records that include names and addresses of the buyer can make it difficult to track
animals for trace back and trace forward and to document changes in ownership.
The facility must maintain sales records that include the full name and address of the buyer.

2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility’s inventory of guinea pigs only includes adult females and totaled 509. A total of 1248 adult guinea pigs,
weanlings, and newborns were counted during this inspection. The facility is not including adult males, weanlings, or
newborns in their inventory as required.
Failure to maintain accurate records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal
losses by deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to
ensure their humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose
the number of animals held, owned, and acquired.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Although the enclosure walls measured 7 inches or more, during the inspection two guinea pigs were observed tobe out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the
inability to access food and water.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
Correct from this day forward
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The guinea pig pens are built with a wooden framework attached to wire mesh. The wood has not been sealed or
painted and therefore is not impervious to moisture.
Unsealed bare wood surfaces are difficult to clean and sanitize, which can lead to disease hazards for the guinea
pigs.
Enclosures for guinea pigs must be constructed and maintained so that they are impervious to moisture, can be
readily cleaned and sanitized, and won’t absorb moisture or odors.

3.29(d) DIRECT
FEEDING.
The majority (approximately 90%) of the self-feeders attached to the inside of the guinea pig enclosures contained
fecal material mixed in with the feed. The fecal pellets appeared dry and not fresh and were mixed throughout the
feed.
Failure to clean feeders often enough to prevent contamination with fecal material can result in avoidance of food or
spread of disease.
Food receptacles must be located to minimize contamination by excreta and must be kept clean.
Correct from this day forward
3.30
WATERING.
The openings around the water nipples are soiled with a buildup of wet dark brown material with wet bedding and
fecal material adhered to it that the guinea pigs must stand in when drinking. In addition, the wire mesh at the ends
of the enclosures where the water nipples are located is coated with a thick layer of wet, brown grime and debris
mixed with wet bedding. The siding being used as a drip pan for the water system is also coated with a thick layer
of dirt and grime.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals. Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the
animals.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The majority of the guinea pig enclosures (approximately 90%) have accumulations of a thick layer of excess fecal
material, soiled bedding, and discarded food throughout the enclosure and are in need of more frequent cleaning.
The facility is cleaning once a week but only sanitizing once a month.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material
and sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.
