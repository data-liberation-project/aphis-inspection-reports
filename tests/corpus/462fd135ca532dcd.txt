3.13(f) CRITICAL
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
The information below was provided to USDA Animal Care from a Los Angeles County Public Health
Veterinarian(LACPHV) concerning an approximately 6-month-old dog that was transported on May 14, 2019, on
flight SU106 Aeroflot Airlines, originating from China. Airway bill number 55500380816. The LACPH veterinarian
and CDC personnel were present at the Aeroflot cargo area when the dog arrived.
A male intact yellow retriever mix displaying neurological signs arrived to the Aeroflot airline cargo area. CDC
personnel denied entry of this dog as a rabies suspect and a LACPHV issued a health order to the airline for this
dog to be seen at a veterinary clinic for evaluation. According to the LACPHV, they cannot rule out rabies and the
dog needed to be quarantined and observed. The dog’s paperwork included a health certificate and rabies
certificate with no information regarding this dog’s neurologic problems.
LACPHV found a veterinary clinic that would be willing to see the dog and quarantine him. The cargo/ intermediate
handler took the dog to an alternate veterinary hospital, but the clinic could not handle the case at that time. The
dog was returned back to the Aeroflot cargo area without being evaluated. The dog was taken to the Los Angeles
City Shelter the following morning by the cargo/intermediate handler and has since received appropriate veterinary
care.
As a registered intermediate (IH), the IH must continue to provide proper care, including veterinary care if needed,
feeding, and housing to any dog and maintain any dog in accordance with generally accepted professional and
husbandry practices while under their care.
