ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (#026-285-517) had a raised swelling approximately 1/2 inch in diameter
between the middle toes on the right front foot. The area appears red and swollen. Some of the surrounding fur
appears wet. The licensee had not noticed this dog's condition until the inspector pointed it out. This rasied,
abnormal swelling between the toes could be the result of injury, infection or a variety of veterinary medical
conditions
which may be painful. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that
all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Note: the licensee contacted his veterinarian for an
appointment for this dog during the inspection. The veterinarian did an examination of the dog and a treament plan
was developed after the facility inspection was conducted. The licensee must ensure that the treatment plan is
followed.
The inspection was conducted with the licensee and a facility representative. The exit interview was conducted with
a facility representative.
