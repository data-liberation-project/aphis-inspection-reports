Most of the dogs in the kennel had excessively long toe nails. The nails were causing the toes to curl, and could
easily tear which would cause the animal pain, or could put stress on ligaments in the toes, causing the animal
discomfort.
There were the dogs, Bichon # 050-096-341, Dachshund #019-884-112, Wheaton Terrier 075-075-064, and
Chihuahua 050-098-842 that had a buildup of brown material on the teeth with some redness of the gums
especially in the canines . Although a dental plan was written and some of the dogs had dental cleanings, the dogs
have not all been checked and graded and there is no follow up of the dental plan at this time.
Some measures to treat the water that can help in the prevention of dental problems have been taken, although
these can help in the initial cases of dental disease are not a solution for advanced cases.
Licensee shall trim nails on all dogs. All the dogs in the kennel shall be checked by the attending veterinarian for
dental issues and grade, also a plan for the dogs with dental issues must be documented. Part of the dental plan
should include prevention. Hooves are currently available for most of the breeders to chew on. Correct the dental
