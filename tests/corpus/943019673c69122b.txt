***One of three bobcats escaped from the enclosure some time between the morning check and the morning
feeding on January 30, 2017. On February 1, 2017, the bobcat was captured on property in a live animal trap that
was placed by facility staff. The bobcat was unharmed.
As part of an internal review of the escape, a hole was noticed in the netting that covers the top of the enclosure. On
closer examination, it was noted that certain portions of the netting was frayed or worn, which may have allowed the
cat to easily create a hole large enough to pass through.
Primary enclosures should be maintained in a manner to ensure the integrity of the enclosure and contain the
animals within. The cover of the bobcat enclosure must be replaced. Additionally, an appropriate schedule for
maintaining the structural strength of the the enclosure must be established and followed. Correct before placing
bobcats or any other exotic cat in the enclosure.
NOTE: An appropriate corrective action plan has been developed in response to the escape. The bobcats are
temporarily housed in another enclosure until the primary enclosure can be appropriately modified.
This is a focused inspection to evaluate the animal care program for small exotic cats.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
