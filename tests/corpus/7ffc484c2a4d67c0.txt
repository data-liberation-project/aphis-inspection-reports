2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two rabbits' right ears were crusted/scabbed in the lower part of their inner ear. This was pointed out to the licensee
during the inspection. This irritation could be due to many causes and needs closer evaluation by the attending
veterinarian. Ensure that the attending veterinarian evaluates these two rabbits and follow the recommended treatment
plan for each rabbit.

Note: The licensee called the attending veterinarian during inspection so that the rabbits could be seen by the attending
veterinarian.

3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
An enclosure housing 3 juvenile tigers was observed to have a hole in the bottom of the metal panel that was
approximately 12 inches wide by 6 inches tall, with sharp points on both sides and top. The hole is due to the water trough
being moved to another location for the winter. While the tigers could not get through this hole, enclosures that are not

properly maintained could injure the animals. Enclosures must be maintained so that they are structurally sound and free
from sharp points and fencing holes/gaps.
3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
The aoudad have some natural shelter and one artificial shelter. While they appeared acclimated to the climate, the male
aoudad was seen lying at the entrance of the artificial shelter and the females could not get into the shelter. The 3 female
aoudads have access to dry bedding and windbreaks created by the rocks in the enclosure, however in very inclement
weather lack of an additional shelter would not protect the 3 females if the male decides not to permit them into the
shelter. Ensure that additional adequate shelter is in place and accessible in the case of inclement weather.
