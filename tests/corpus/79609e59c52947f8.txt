INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A protocol involving rabbits that was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee did not contain a
completed description of the proposed use of the animals. The use of two animals in a pilot study in which a suture
was placed in the eye was not clearly specified in the protocol. Additionally, the size of the suture (6-0) to be used in
the pilot study was not specified. The main study was to utilize a smaller size (10-0). Additionally all agents to be
used, such as analgesics, must be specified.
A complete description of the proposed use of animals allows the IACUC members to understand all procedures so
that only proposals in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act are approved. Without such a description, the
IACUC cannot consider the potential impacts upon the animal care and welfare.
All protocols and subsequent amendments approved by the IACUC must contain such a complete description.
