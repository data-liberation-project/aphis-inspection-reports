2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male ShihTzu, tag #!50 "Biscuit", was observe in his kennel repeatedly licking the air . Upon closer observation it
was noted that this dog has significant plaque and tartar built up on the majority of his teeth. The build up on his
upper incisors and back molars have entirely encased the teeth making it difficult to visualize the normal shape of
the teeth. The gums above the upper incisors were red and inflamed. In addition to the teeth issues this dog also
has a dried dark brown discharge around his eyes and at times bubbles were observed coming from his nostrils.
These signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease, can be painful, lead to the development of other
health problems, and can inhibit the ability of the animal to eat normally. The licensee must have this animal
examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
