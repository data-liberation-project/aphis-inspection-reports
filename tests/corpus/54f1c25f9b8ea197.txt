2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:01 PM on
23-APR-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I honked the horn several times. I declined to get out of the vehicle due to the presence
of a barking and unleashed large dog. I called the phone number for the licensee and left a message. After waiting
for 30 minutes, I left the facility.
