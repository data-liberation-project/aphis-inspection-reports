ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for review during this inspection. Licensees' with
part time attending veterinarians must have a formal written arrangement with a veterinarian (PVC). This is required
so that USDA personnel can confirm that the licensee is working with a veterinarian and is following the
recommendations from that veterinarian.
A program of veterinary care needs to be developed for this facility by the attending veterinarian that includes
recommendations for all regulated species at the facility. Examples of some of the topics to be covered in the PVC
are:
*The veterinarian's schedule for visits to the facility.
*Parasite control program if appropriate for the species.
*Vaccination recommendations if appropriate for the species.
*Routine medical testing if appropriate for the species.
*Instructions on necropsies for unexpected deaths.
*Any other recommendations the veterinarian feels necessary for this facility.
*Emergency contact information.
*Veterinarian's signature and date.
This document must indicate to USDA that you and your veterinarian have an active working relationship.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple fences were in poor repair. Some of the animals held at this facility are camels and zebra. One of the
fences containing a female camel and her baby was constructed of 2 x 4 inch bendable wire and welded wire goat
panel. This was all attached to the posts with baling wire. The fence surrounding an area with farm equipment was a hodgepodge of different materials. None of which were
securely attached.
These fences are not considered appropriate for animals the size of camels and zebra. A camel or a zebra could
easily go through these fences which could result in injury to the animals on both sides of the fence. Fences must
be constructed of materials that are appropriate for the animals being contained. All fences that are not structurally
sound and constructed of material adequate for camels and zebra need to be repaired or replaced.
