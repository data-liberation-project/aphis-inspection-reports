INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocol AUP 14-006 did not contain a
rationale for the numbers of animals to be used in the activity.
The IACUC is responsible for ensuring that appropriate numbers of animals are used in each approved activity. In
order to perform this function the IACUC must know both how many animals are needed for an activity and why that
number of animals is needed. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that each activity involving animals
contains and adequate rationale for the number of animals being used.

2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC approved protocol AUP 14-006 did not provide a complete description of animal use. According to the
protocol, tissue samples are to be taken from the ears or tails of a variety of small mammals. The protocol states
that "very small" tissue samples would be obtained using scissors, however no sample size was specified and no
location was provided regarding tissue removed from tails.
Inadequate descriptions of activities using animals may prevent the IACUC from identifying deficiencies in activities
and ensuring that animal activities are in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Knowing the size of tissuesamples in this case is important for determining the protocol's pain category as well as determining that
pre-procedural and post-procedural animal care is adequate. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the
investigator provides a complete description of proposed activities that involve the use of animals in order that those
activities may be adequately reviewed and determined to be in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.
