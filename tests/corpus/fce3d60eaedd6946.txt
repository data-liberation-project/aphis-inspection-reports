2.33(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
* At the time of inspection, macaques were being hand carried back to their primary enclosures after being sedated
with ketamine. The animals had just completed a non-invasive ECG procedure performed by the primary
investigator staff. The attending veterinarian stated that while recovering from sedation, animals are closely
observed and primate squeeze cages are pulled forward far enough that the animals can easily lean on a wall if
they lose balance. At the time of inspection, the caretaker returning the animals to their enclosures was not pulling
the squeeze cages forward so the animals had unrestricted movements in their metal enclosures. Additionally, the
caretaker was not closely observing the animals as they were recovering. Several minutes after a female macaque
(#CP3103, DOB 2-7-2012) was returned to her enclosure, she stood upright, lost her balance, and fell to her side
hitting her head on the floor of the enclosure. The same animal fell two more times within a couple minutes.
** Until fully recovered from sedation, animals are at an increased risk for becoming injured or having a medical
complication and should be handled and observed accordingly.
*** The registrant must ensure that the program of veterinary care includes guidance to principal investigators and
other personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia,
tranquilization, and euthanasia.
