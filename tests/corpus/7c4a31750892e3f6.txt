There were 4 wooden dog shelters in the outdoor housing area that did not have adequate bedding. The
temperature at the time of the inspection was 17 degrees F and the shelters did not have enough straw bedding to
cover the floor inside the shelter. Adequate bedding is necessary to insulate the dogs from the cold temperatures
and helps them to retain their body heat. The licensee shall ensure that all of the outdoor shelters contain clean,
dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F and additional clean, dry bedding is required
when the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 11/19/14
