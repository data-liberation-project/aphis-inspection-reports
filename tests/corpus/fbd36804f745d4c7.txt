2.50(c)(2)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Five dogs, two guard dog and three wolf hybrids did not have sequential numbers on their tags. The dog (cid:28)Annabel(cid:29)
did not have a tag (it did not have a sequential number) on her. Two domestic cats do not have sequential numbers
on their tags.
Official identification is required in order to facilitate the required record keeping and to ensure that each animal's
identity can be known for certain. A system to ensure that all dogs are properly identified needs to be created.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Two guard dogs and three wolf hybrids do not have a sequential number on the tag that can be linked to the
acquisition records. Two domestic cats do not have a sequential number on the tag that can be linked to the
acquisition records. Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can
be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking or tracing of animals.
The licensee must ensure that all required records are filled in with complete and accurate information.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Two wolf hybrids have night quarters consisting of a concrete slab surrounded by chain link sides. Surrounding the
chain link sides, there is a sheet metal building. Adjacent to the dog(cid:25)s night quarters, hair and debris is being
hosed off the concrete slab and ends up on the ground. Not all the material is being removed from the area andbeing properly disposed of.
This area needs to be cleaned more often to prevent possible bacterial, algae, or mold build up. This debris could
potentially create a health risk to the animals and the keepers. The system to ensure that the debris is removed in a
timely manner is not working. The facility needs to intensify the cleaning routine to remove the potential health
hazards.

SANITATION.
The black bears have several den areas that are not being adequately cleaned. The (cid:28)Tahoe Quarantine(cid:29) door area
(this is a door and window that is about 2 x 2 feet. It links the kitchen to the den. This is used at times to be able to
observe this den(cid:25)s animal and to feed the animal) has an accumulation of cobwebs and straw. The dust
accumulation on the cobwebs indicates that this area has not been cleaned for an extended period of time. There is
currently one bear in this den. The middle exhibit den, with two bears, has numerous cobwebs with extensive dust
on them. The dust on some of the cobwebs is thick enough to make the areas appear to be opaque.
The general cleaning system to keep the areas free of the buildup of excess cobwebs is not adequate. This system
is to be reviewed to ensure that all the areas are adequately cleaned. If these areas are not be being cleaned
enough, it indicates that there may be other cleaning issues which could affect the health of the animals.
