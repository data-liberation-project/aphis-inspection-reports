FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Lighting. The lighting in the middle section of the guinea pig room does provide ample light to allow adequate
inspection and cleaning. A flashlight was needed in order to observe the guinea pigs today. Indoor lighting for
guinea pigs must be of good quality and well distributed. Inadequate lighting can make daily observations more
difficult to identify health problems, increase fungal issues, and cause cleaning problems. Additional lighting such as
lights, windows, and/or skylights must be provided in the middle section of the guinea pig room to allow for
adequate inspection and cleaning. Correct by April 4, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
