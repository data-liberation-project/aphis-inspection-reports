FEEDING.
Fifty pound boxes of rendered red meat is stored in the freezer room of the transport trailer. When the door to the
freezer was opened, much of the meat in the small room was opened or spilled. The boxes appear to have been
tossed about and were stacked haphazardly. Frost was seen on some of the muscle meat, Meat that is exposed to
freezer temperatures can lose moisture, flavor and nutrients. All meat should be properly stored so that it is not
exposed to the open air of the freezer. To be corrected by 3-3-17.
