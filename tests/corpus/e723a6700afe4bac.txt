3.125(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the morning of September 22, 2018 a keeper was unable to find the male spotted skunk, Digby, in his enclosure
at the Life Underground Exhibit. Upon examination of the upper holding pen, the keepers found a small hole at the
bottom of the cage frame. The facility believes rust created the hole in the metal wire fence, which was not initially
visible to the staff because it was covered with rocks, dirt, and large pieces of bark chips.
On the morning of September 25, 2018, Digby was caught in a trap that was placed near his enclosure. He was
seen by the attending veterinarian and no medical issues were reported.
Enclosures for all animals must be constructed in a manner so that they contain the animals securely, in order to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The staff has blocked the hole by securing an additional metal fencing to the base of the enclosure, ensuring any
animal housed in this enclosure cannot escape. The facility should continue to monitor all enclosures to ensure that
they adequately contain the animals housed within. A system of timely identification, maintenance, and repair of
facilities must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of all animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
