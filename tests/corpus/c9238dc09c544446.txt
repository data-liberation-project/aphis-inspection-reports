HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
During the inspection a health certificate was found for the cat called "Johnny Cash" issued on August 5, 2019. This
transportation started on August 19, 2019 and delivery of the cats was on August 21. This is 6 days over the
maximum specified date for issuance of health certificates by the prescribed rule in the Animal Welfare Act.
It was also noted that the licensee declares in its contract that the health certificate is valid for 30 days. This
information is incorrect. The health certificate shall not be issued more than 10 days prior to the date of the delivery
of the animals, which is the prescribed rule by the Animal Welfare Act.
No carrier shall transport in commerce any dog, cat or non-human primate, unless accompanied by a health
certificate executed and issued by an authorized veterinarian, which must not be more than 10 days before the
delivery of the dog, cat or non-human primate for transport.
Measures must be taken to provide the required health certificates before any transport is done, also the accepting
carrier shall keep and maintain a copy of the health certification completed as required by the AWA for a period of
one year.

3.14(b)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
During the inspection, it was found that the transport referred to in this report took more than 30 hours. According to
the licensee, one of the transport cages arrived in such a dirty condition that it had to be discarded. The inspector
also spoke to the vet clinic that received the cat and they confirmed that one of the cats was soiled by feces at
arrival.
These findings demonstrate that the driver for this transport did not clean the enclosure at least every 24 hours
during transit as required by the Animal Welfare Act. Soiled animals are uncomfortable and may have skin problemsas a result.
If the dogs or cats are in transit for more than 24 hours, the enclosures must be cleaned and any litter replaced, or
other methods, such as moving the animals to another enclosure, must be utilized to prevent the soiling of the dogs
or cats by body wastes.
