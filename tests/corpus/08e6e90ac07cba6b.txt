INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
** The IACUC has conducted its semiannual program review and facility inspection in September of 2014, but has
not reported the findings to the Institutional Official. Reports to the IO must be reviewed and signed by a majority of
the IACUC members and include any minority views. The reports shall be updated at least once every six months
upon completion of the required semiannual evaluations. It is important to report these findings to the IO and to
alert the IO of any deficiencies in the program or facilities in order to ensure the continued success of the research
facility.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
** All of the protocols for clinical animal use (encompassing cats, dogs, laboratory animals, and large animals) were
all initially approved in the period of 2012-13; however, all of these protocols have not been reviewed on an annual
basis. The IACUC must conduct a continuing review of all ongoing activities and protocols for covered species a
minimum of once a year. It is important to review the protocols of animal procedures to ensure that all elements of
the program are promoting the health and well-being of the animals. A review of these protocols must be completed
and documented at least annually.
