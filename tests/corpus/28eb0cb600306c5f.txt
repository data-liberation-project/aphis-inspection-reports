ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee stated he does not currently have a written program of veterinary care and while he has veterinarians
who can provide services for the animals when contacted they do not make regularly scheduled visits to the facility.
Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements to ensure that adequate veterinary
can be provided to the animals on the premises. Formal arrangements with a part time or consulting veterinarian
must include a written program of veterinary care for all species that reflects veterinary, husbandry, handling and
dietary practices at the facility and regularly scheduled visits by the veterinarian often enough to provide appropriate
oversight of the care and use of the animals. Correct by: July 25, 2017.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Bella" the adult female giraffe has severely overgrown hooves on all four legs. The excessive length has resulted in
twisted and broken hooves that no longer have normal intended contact with the ground. Although the animal did
not exhibit obvious signs of pain and distress or significant gait abnormalities during this inspection, the condition of
the feet can result in these sequela as well as permanent structural and orthopedic abnormalities. Demonstration of
adequate veterinary care and husbandry for giraffe includes routine hoof care as needed. The licensee must have
the animal evaluated by a veterinarian experienced in giraffe care and develop a treatment plan for the feet. A
review of the giraffe diet should be included in this consultation to rule out diet as a contributing factor to abnormal
hoof growth. Correct by: July 25, 2017.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee stated during this inspection that Bella's abnormal hoof growth had first been recognized two or three
years ago. However, this problem related to the animal's health and well-being was not communicated to an
attending veterinarian and has remained unaddressed. The information obtained from daily observations of the
animals by the facility must be relayed accurately and frequently enough to the attending veterinarian so that
guidance and treatment of health problems can be given and adequate veterinary care can be provided. Correct by:
From this day forward.3.125(a)(1)
