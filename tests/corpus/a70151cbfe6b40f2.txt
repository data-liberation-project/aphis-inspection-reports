2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no written Program of Veterinary Care available for inspection. Each dealer shall employ an attending
veterinarian under formal arrangements to ensure adequate veterinary care to all animals in the premises, with an
updated written Program of Veterinary Care that demonstrates regular scheduled visits (at least annually) to the
premises where the animals are kept at. The licensee informed/stated that he has the Program of Veterinary Care
in effect and good standing, but unfortunately the documentation could not be located during the inspection time.
The licensee needs to provide evidence as soon as possible of his arrangements with the attending veterinarian.
