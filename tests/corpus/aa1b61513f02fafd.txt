ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1330 on
24-Oct-18. I went to the licensee's house. The licensee was home, but was unavailable to complete the inspection
with me at the time due to work obligations. I informed him I would be writing it up as an attempted and that I would
try back at another time.
End of report.
