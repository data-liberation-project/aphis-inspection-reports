RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on March 8, 2016, records of animal births and deaths were not maintained for the
guinea pigs. Records must be kept on animal births and deaths for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care
program, and to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on animal
births and deaths are kept and maintained. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
