Watering.
There was a buildup of bedding, fecal material, and debris in the bottom of the wastewater piping around the nipples of
the automatic waterers in approximately 30 pens (approximately 1/3 of pens).
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.
