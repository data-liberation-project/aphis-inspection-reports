2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses microchips placed under the dog’s skin as the official form of identification. At least 9 dogs (8 Miniature
Australian Shepherds and 1 Rottweiler) over 16 weeks of age are currently not microchipped, nor identified by any other
means (official USDA tag number or tattoo). Official identification is necessary for APHIS officials to positively identify
animals for inspection and to properly trace their movements.

All live dogs shall be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar around the animal’s neck, by a legible tattoo marking
approved by the Administrator, or by a microchip placed under the dog’s skin. The licensee must apply one of the forms of
identification on each dog. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have an official form of identification at all times.

2.75(a)(1)(vi) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
On the facility’s Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005), there are 12 dogs missing their
official identification number (Benny, Remi, Murphy, Bambi, Brandi, Demi, Paris, Bank, Elsa, June Bug, Molly, Pepper).
The official USDA identification number is necessary for APHIS officials to identify animals and trace their movements.


Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records that fully disclose the official identification number of each animal.
The licensee must ensure that the acquisition and disposition records for each puppy contains a unique identification
number.

3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
In at least 9 enclosures housing a total of 22 adult dogs, there were dog shelters in disrepair. The shelters were made of a
wood frame and metal siding, the metal siding was deteriorating in several points that left rusty, sharp edges. These sharp
edges were present on the threshold of the shelter entrance and the corners of the shelters. On at least 3 of the shelters,
the metal siding was not screwed down on the corners leaving a sharp edge. The wood frame of these shelters has been
heavily chewed on by the dogs.

In one enclosure housing 2 dogs, the corners of the metal water receptacle had sharp edges present.

Sharp metal points in an enclosure may result in lacerations or serious injury to the dogs. Wood that has been heavily
chewed on may result in an injury to the dogs' mouth and decrease the structural integrity of the enclosure. Housing
facilities must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. The facility must repair the housing
facilities so that they are kept in good repair and are safe for the dogs.

To be corrected by: 10-June-2022.

3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
In at least 4 outdoor enclosures, housing 12 adult dogs there was straw bedding present in the dog shelter, but the straw
was heavily soiled and wet. According to the Weather Channel, the temperature the previous day had a high of 38
degrees F and a low of 24 degrees F. The low temperature the day of the inspection was 25 degrees F. Failure to provide
clean, dry bedding material does not ensure the dogs are protected from frigid temperatures, which could have a negative
impact on their health and well-being and the dogs may become soiled.

Outdoor shelters must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F and
additional bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower. The licensee must remove the soiled
bedding and add clean, dry bedding material to the shelter and ensure that all outdoor shelters contain appropriate
bedding material when required.

To be corrected by: From this day forward.
3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The outdoor enclosures housing 26 adult dogs had concrete floors that were not sealed from moisture. Each enclosure
also had at least one wood framed dog shelter that was worn and not sealed on the inside of the shelter. Surfaces that
are not impervious to moisture cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized to prevent disease hazards to the dogs.

The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of outdoor housing facilities that are in contact with animals can be readily
cleaned and sanitized.

3.9(b)

Feeding
In at least one enclosure housing 3 adult dogs, the hanging metal food receptacle is completely covered in rust.
Receptacles that are covered in rust are not able to be readily cleaned and sanitized to prevent diseases hazards to the
dogs.

The licensee must ensure that all feeding receptacles are made of a durable material that can be easily cleaned and
sanitized or be disposable.

To be corrected by: 22-April-2022.
3.10(a)

Watering
Three adult Labrador Retrievers in their primary enclosure had no access to water. Inspectors asked the licensee to
provide the dogs a bowl of water and when given water, the dogs did not drink any water. Dogs that do not have access
to water may become dehydrated and reduced water consumption may lead to additional medical problems.

Potable water must be continuously available for the health and well-being of the dogs, unless restricted by the attending
veterinarian.

To be corrected by: From this day forward.
