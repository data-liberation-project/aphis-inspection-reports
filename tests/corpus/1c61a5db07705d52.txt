Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The adult, female pig known as "Bonnie" is noted to have overgrown hooves; the hooves are curving and the toes are
beginning to drag along the ground when the pig lifts its feet to walk due to a lack of regular foot trimming. When this
was brought up by the inspector, a facility representative scheduled an appointment on 11/08/2022 to have the pig's feet
trimmed on 11/16/2022. Failure to properly maintain feet can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause
injuries. The licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, to include the
expedient correction of the existing overgrown hoof condition of this animal as well as the timely and appropriate foot
care, as needed, for all the animals.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, records indicated that the facility acquired three African crested porcupines, but only two
porcupines were present during the inspection. When the inspector inquired as to the disposition of the third porcupine, a
facility representative stated that the animal had died. The necropsy report dated 09/13/2022 from the attending
veterinarian states that the animal was thin and, "Was seen alive but lethargic on Sunday. Found dead today." That


Sunday was confirmed to be 09/11/2022. According to the dates on the official veterinary necropsy record, the porcupine
was found dead two days after it was observed as being lethargic. There was no communication from the zoo staff to the
veterinarian regarding the lethargy prior to the animal's death. Daily observations and prompt reporting and consultation
with the attending veterinarian concerning any suspected problems is paramount to animal health and well-being. Failure
to communicate potential problems to the veterinarian, including lethargy or thin body condition, can result in prolonged
animal suffering and/or death. The licensee must ensure that there is a mechanism of direct and frequent communication
in place, so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed to
the attending veterinarian.

Handling of animals.
There is a section of public barrier fencing that spans the length of the primary enclosures housing three adult kangaroos,
an adult guanaco, three adult alpacas, an adult male camel, two adult goats, an adult male barbary sheep and three adult
mule deer that is less than three feet in height in various places, as well as in disrepair at one section. Public barrier
fencing is important to protect both the animals and people; people or animals can be injured by unauthorized direct
contact and animals can become ill if they eat food or objects presented to them by people. The licensee must ensure
that there is sufficient distance and barriers of sufficient height and integrity (at least 3' in height and in good repair)
between the animals and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.

Facilities, general.


The chain link fencing that serves as the front of the primary enclosure for an adult male camel, an adult guanaco and
three adult alpacas is in poor repair, being detached from some of the support posts and sagging on the right end of the
enclosure. Primary enclosures that are not in good repair or that are not constructed of such material and strength as
appropriate for the animals involved can result in animal injury or escape. The licensee must ensure that housing
enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals.
