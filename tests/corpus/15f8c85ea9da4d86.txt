2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Upon request to inspect the Dogs on Hand forms 7005's and Record of Disposition forms 7006's, the owner stated
that he did not have accurate records and did not produce the records for inspection. Records must be available for
inspection to ensure that they are accurate, in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and enable USDA to
properly track and identify animals at the facility. All dealers must allow APHIS officials to examine records required
to be kept by the Act and the regulations.
3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Within the large building next to the east wall there is an enclosure that has a defective water nozzle that is
connected to the automatic watering system. There is a constant stream of water coming out of the nozzle and
pooling underneath the enclosure that contains one dog. There is a potential for the dog not to remain clean or dry.
Unsanitary conditions exist if the water nozzle is defective and allows water to form a pool under the enclosures.
The licensee must ensure that the primary enclosures are kept in good repair.
Corrected at time of inspection. Licensee replaced the defective water nozzle with one that works properly.
Exit interview conducted with licensee.
