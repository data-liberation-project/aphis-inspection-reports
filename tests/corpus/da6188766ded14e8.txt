ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:10 pm on
07/31/14. An individual at the premises said that the owner was at work. I called and left a message on the
owners phone. I made another attempt at 5:50 pm and the individual said that the owner was getting ready for an
appointment. The individual stated the owner had to leave right away for the appointment.
This attempted inspection will be sent both regular and certified mail.
