FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 3 outdoor walk-in enclosures housing opossums. On the left side of the center enclosure the wire panel
is coming loose from the vertical wooden support. The enclosure needs to be kept in good repair to prevent injury
to the animals, to contain the animals and to prevent unwanted animals from entering the enclosure.
All 3 enclosures show signs of aging, wear, and degredation and it is recommended that they all be carefully
inspected on a regular basis for areas that need repair and that some priority be put on their replacement.
The loose wire needs to be repaired by 15 August 2014
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
