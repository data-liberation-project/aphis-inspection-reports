2.1(b)(2)(ii)

Requirements and application
The licensee breeds and sells Leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) as part of her regulated business. However, exotic
and wild felids were not listed or approved on the initial application for a license. Accurate information must be provided in
the application so the inspector can ensure compliance with the appropriate regulations and standards prior to the
applicant being issued a license by USDA APHIS. Immediately cease any regulated activities with exotic and wild felids,
including selling leopard cats and any offspring resulting from breeding of leopard cats. Reapply for a new license and list
exotic and wild felids on the application if regulated activity will be conducted in the future with leopard cats or any other
species of exotic and wild felids.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee reported that two kittens have perished on the premises since the last inspection. According to veterinary
records provided to the inspectors by the licensee, as well as the Attending Veterinarian (AV), feline panleukopenia was
an underlying cause of death for one kitten (male, Bengal, ~4.5 months), and suspected feline herpes virus (feline
rhinotracheitis) was an underlying cause of death for the other kitten (female, Asian Leopard Cat, 4 months). The written
program of veterinary care approved by the AV has a vaccination protocol that includes immunization against these two
viral diseases. The licensee and AV have confirmed to inspectors that she is not vaccinating in accordance with the

protocol. Failure to follow the vaccination protocol leads to increased susceptibility of the animals to preventable infectious
diseases. The licensee must follow the written program of veterinary care’s vaccination protocol to ensure the use of
appropriate methods to prevent diseases.

There were several cats (two enclosures in the cattery – one housing three adult cats and the other housing two adult
cats - and one enclosure in the living room housing two kittens, of which had fresh, bright red blood in the stool) with
unresolved diarrhea whereby the AV had yet to be notified of their condition. The diarrhea in all enclosures was the color
and consistency of melted chocolate. The kittens housed in the living room enclosure were seen by the AV on January 5,
2023, for diarrhea, among other things, that had yet to resolve. Both kittens (one of which had the microchip #:
985141005230533) had thin body condition with body condition scores of 2.5-3/9 and exhibiting visible spinal processes,
shoulder blades, and hip bones despite seemingly healthy appetites. The licensee was following a diarrhea protocol
verbally agreed upon with her AV where she was actively treating the animals. However, the AV instructed her to contact
him if there was no resolution of the diarrhea after 5-7 days, and the licensee had not done so at the time of the
inspection. Not contacting the AV for unresolved veterinary health problem within the timeframe directed by the AV
prevents the AV from being able to properly address the health problems and increases the chances that the animals’
health will worsen and lead to severe discomfort, pain, or death. The licensee has a history of infectious diseases
affecting her colony - of which some animals have perished - including, but not limited to coccidia, giardia, panleukopenia,
and herpes. With proper veterinary care and other aspects of animal care as directed by the AV, said diseases are
preventable. The AV has confirmed with the inspector that due to the licensee not following all his directions for veterinary
care and other aspects of animal care, the animals at the facility are at an increased risk of becoming seriously ill and
perishing from preventable infectious diseases. Failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries can foster an unhealthy environment that contributes to the animals contracting preventable

diseases/conditions, delay the onset of diagnosing and treating ailments, and can consequently lead to unnecessary
suffering. Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. All cats that the inspector identified
with diarrhea need to be examined by a veterinarian immediately.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Disposition information for cats - including adults and kittens - that both left the property and perished in the past, was
lacking required information such as dates, disposition, identification, addresses, and other necessary information.
Without proper documentation of animals associated with the facility, both past and present, there is no way to adequately
track animal movement, nor ascertain if any abnormalities in animal births or deaths are present. Each dealer shall make,
keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information under this section concerning each
cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned held, or otherwise in his/her possession or under his/her control, or which is
transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer, including any offspring born of any animal while in
his/her possession or under his/her control. Furthermore, each dealer shall use Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats
On Hand (APHIS Form 7005) and Records of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) to make, keep, and
maintain the information required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
2.134 Repeat

Contingency planning.
The licensee has a contingency plan template and has basic information on it such as addresses and phone numbers,
however, situations the licensee might experience that would trigger the need for the measures identified in a contingency
plan to be put into action (i.e. emergencies such as electrical outages, fires, animal escapes, natural disasters most likely
to be experienced, etc.), specific tasks to prevent and respond to those potential hazards, the responsible individuals for

said tasks, and detail needed to perform those tasks, are missing and/or incomplete. Lack of a contingency plan could be
detrimental to the animal’s health and well-being if the licensee is not properly prepared. An adequate contingency plan
must be developed and documented to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and care in
the event of an emergency or disaster (one that could be reasonably anticipated/expected to be harmful to the health and
well-being of the animals).
3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The white building that is currently being utilized to house two (2) special needs Asian Leopard cats has an abundance of
construction material, animal equipment, trash/junk, and debris covering the front half of room in which the cats are
housed. Insanitary conditions such as these increase the chance of health issues, pests, and can adversely affect the
well-being of the animals. Housing facilities must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste material, junk, weeds, and
other discarded materials. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter, including
equipment, furniture, and stored material.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

The physical inspection of the premises was performed on January 27, 2023. Additional inspection procedures involving
review of documents and consulting with the Attending Veterinarian and licensee continued until February 8, 2023. The
final exit briefing was conducted on February 9, 2023 as a result.
