A perimeter fence is required of sufficient height (at least 8 feet tall) to prevent unauthorized persons and animals
from entering the facility, and to act as a secondary containment system in the event that an animal escapes from
its primary enclosure. Unauthorized persons and wildlife or stray animals may harm, injure, or spread disease to the
resident animals at the facility. Animals that escape from the premises may suffer from hunger, thirst, exposure to
the elements, and injury from cars or animals. Correct by maintaining a perimeter fence that is at least 8 feet tall and 3 feet away from any primary enclosure, and
which is constructed to protect animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it. The perimeter fence must be constructed to act as secondary containment system for animals
in the facility. Correct by: May 1st, 2019.
