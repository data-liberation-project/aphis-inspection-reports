ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One fawn colored adult female Boxer named Lexie ( collar number 14 ) is thin in appearance. When viewed from
the back and side, the ribs, backbone and hip bones were visible from a lack of fat cover. In addition, an abdominal
tuck and prominent waist were observed. The licensee stated that the drop in body condition started two to three
months ago. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been consulted. The loss of body weight
could be an indication this dog is not receiving adequate nutrition or it could be internal problems. This can affect
the ability of this dog to gain or maintain its body weight. This dog must be examined by a licensed vet for an
appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis and
treatment. All medical records must be made available to the inspector upon request. Correct by 9/1/16.
