ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1130 on
09/30/2015. The inspector could not access the property due to a security gate. A message was left with the
caretaker and the owner, and the inspector honked several times throughout the hour he was there.
