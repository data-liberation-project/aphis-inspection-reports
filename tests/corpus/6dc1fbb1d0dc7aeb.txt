Facilities, general.
The Bobcat named Frankie had chewed a 5 inch diameter hole in the top of the den box. This material is not appropriate
for a bobcat to be chewing and ingesting. Construction materials can cause intestinal impactions, health concerns or
even death. This is a potential area for escape and animals that escape their enclosures are no longer protected and
cannot be cared for. Corrected during the inspection.

The sub-grate flooring was exposed in the bobcat, coyote, and lynx enclosures where the dirt/gravel has been dug out,
exposing a metal sub-grate. There is a gap between the metal grate and the dirt below and the above-mentioned animals
must sit/walk on the metal grate. The gaps in the metal grate have the potential to cause entrapment or injury to the
animal.

The flooring in the badger’s enclosure is made of corrugated metal panels. This metal has deteriorated and has many
rusted areas creating gaps and holes in the floor. These holes and gaps could result in nail or limb injuries.

A water receptacle in the wolf enclosure had an exposed piece of rebar where concrete had broken away. The receptacle


is in disrepair. The condition of this water receptacle and can lead to injury and may interfere with the animal’s ability and
desire to drink.

A rusted vertical structural support pole with many holes on the end in the enclosure with a wolf. This metal support has
deteriorated to the point that it is no longer structurally sound. This could lead to injury of the enclosed animal or potential
escape.

The facility representative must ensure all housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence in the north forty had a tree fall on it in one section two months ago which removed a small top
section of the fence approximately two feet in length. The perimeter fence in this area is now approximately 5 feet in
height, Problems with the perimeter fence may provide unwanted and unauthorized people and animals access to the
facility. Based on the animal species maintained within the facility, the facility representative must ensure that the
perimeter fence is at least 8 feet high. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the
facility by restricting animals and unauthorized people from going through it or under it and so that it can function as a
secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.

Watering.


The water receptacles for the lynx, fox, bobcat, wolf, and fisher are not clean and sanitary. Many of these receptacles
have a green coating on the interior surface in contact with the water and some of the water receptacles have dead flies
and floating debris. Failure to provide a clean water receptacle can lead to water that becomes contaminated and animals
that are reluctant to drink as often as they normally would. Lack of potable water can result in dehydration and
exacerbation of other medical problems. The facility must ensure that potable water be accessible to the animals as often
as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals and that all water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary. To be

Sanitation.
There is excessive accumulation of excreta and animal food waste in the animal enclosures. This includes the following
species: lynx, bobcat, river otter, tiger, fisher, mountain lion, pine marten and raccoons. Areas of accumulations of excreta
are especially of concern when they occupy an animal's shelter structure, when it accumulates on fur or feet,
contaminates water or food or interferes with the animals access to food and water sources. These areas of excreta also
attract pests and can play a role in disease transmission.

There is an excessive accumulation and buildup of dirt, grim, fur and urine on shift doors and enclosure walls in the small
animal building and in the north forty area housing the lynx, and bobcats. This is providing an environment that
encourages the proliferation of flies. Flies are an annoyance and cause discomfort to the animals and may cause skin
lesions, pain and tissue damage in the case of fly strike. The facility must ensure that all enclosures, the buildings and
grounds are kept clean to facilitate good husbandry practices and to protect the health of the animals.

The facility must ensure that excreta be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination


of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and odors.

3.131(d)

Sanitation.
Excessive flies were seen throughout the facility, some on the animals and primarily in the environment. There was no
pest control plan in place at the time of the inspection. Flies provide an annoyance and cause discomfort to the animals
and may cause skin lesions, pain and tissue damage in the case of fly strike. The facility must ensure that a safe and
effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests is established and maintained.
To be corrected by: Corrected during inspection.

Employees.
The facility representative stated that they are struggling to keep up with husbandry chores due to decreased employee
numbers because of COVID-19. Many cleaning and maintenance issues were present due to the shortage of personnel.
The dirty/green water, the enclosures with dirt, grim, food debris and excreta are all evidence of not enough trained
employees present. The facility representative must ensure a sufficient number of adequately trained employees are
utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
