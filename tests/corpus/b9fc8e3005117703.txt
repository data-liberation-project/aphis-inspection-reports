ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 a.m. on
03-JUL-19.
When I arrived at the facility at 10:45 a.m. I called the licensee. She stated that they were currently not at the facility
and wouldn’t be available to conduct the inspection today.
