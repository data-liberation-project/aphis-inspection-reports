ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection a bennet wallaby was found lying on its side in the mud. When prodded to get up this animal
appeared weak and uncoordinated. While questioning the licensee about this group of wallabies it was discovered
that 10 animals had died over the past 3 weeks. The attending veterinarian had been informed about 2 or 3 deaths
but was unaware of the extent of the losses.
The licensee is responsible for communicating animal health issues with the veterinarian in a timely manner. In this
case, if the licensee had communicated the extent of the problem with the veterinarian sooner maybe some of the
10 deaths could have been prevented. The licensee was instructed to take the weak wallaby to the veterinarian
immediately. In the future the veterinarian needs to be consulted immediately whenever there is an issue with
animal heath, behavior, or well-being.
To be corrected immediately.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Black shade cloth along some of the fences was not secured properly. Large sections were hanging loose in the
enclosures with the animals. An animal could become entangled in the loose shade cloth causing injury or death.
The loose cloth blowing in the wind could cause some animals to become spooked causing injury or death. Other
areas of the shade cloth were frayed allowing the animals(cid:25) access to string like sections that could be ingested
causing illness. A chain link fence section in the zebra enclosure was loose with several inches lying on the ground
allowing the zebra to walk on it. This could allow a zebra(cid:25)s feet to become caught in the links or cause injury from
the sharp edges. The facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. The above issues need to
be repaired and maintained in good condition.

3.127FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The bennett wallaby shelter was very muddy. During inclement weather these animals would have no place to get
out of mud and rain/snow. Some type of drainage needs to be established to provide the animals with a dry shelter
or a new shelter needs to be built in an area with better drainage.
