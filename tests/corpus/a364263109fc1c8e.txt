Sanitation.
There is a buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the metal sides of enclosures. Inadequate cleaning and
sanitation exposes the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal and viral diseases. The
presence of organic material and debris on the sides of enclosures makes disinfectants ineffective. Correct by ensuring
that all primary enclosures are kept clean and that enclosures are sanitized at least once 2 weeks. Correct by February
12,2021.
