2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On the afternoon of Saturday, 7-MARCH-2020, a guinea pig was transferred to an off-exhibit area with reported
symptoms of a, "major wound on back, infection," and a dose of antibiotic was administered. On this day, the
veterinarian was not contacted, and there is no written guidance from an attending veterinarian to authorize
treatment. On the morning of Sunday, 8-MARCH-2020, the guinea pig was noted to be “rapidly declining,” with
written instructions to, “keep comfortable.” Food and water were provided, and the enclosure was spot-cleaned, but
a veterinarian was not contacted, and no additional treatments were administered. The animal was not seen by a
veterinarian until Monday, 9-MARCH-2020, when the animal was euthanized. Available staff were unable to explain
how the injury occurred, and the Animal Care Manager explained that their typical guinea pig veterinarian is closed
on Sundays.
The licensee must ensure that all animals showing signs of illness or injury are evaluated in a timely manner, and
receive adequate veterinary care. Daily observations of animals must include a mechanism for communication of
pertinent findings, to ensure that timely and accurate information is conveyed to the attending veterinarian, and that
health issues are addressed in a timely manner to minimize pain and distress. A complete Program of Veterinary
Care must include the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care. Delays in evaluation and treatment
can jeopardize the animals’ health and welfare. Corrected from this date forward, by ensuring that all animals at the facility are provided adequate veterinary care,
including provisions for emergency, weekend, and holiday care.
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
Upon entering a storage shed containing bags of guinea pig feed, a medium-sized rodent was observed running
across stored items. Numerous rodent droppings were also noted alongside a bag of guinea pig feed. At least one
(1) bag of guinea pig feed showed evidence of rodent contamination, with several holes chewed through the bag.
There was no evidence that contaminated feed was fed the guinea pigs. Although unused rodent traps were
available on-site, no pest control devices were present in the shed, and there did not appear to be an active pest
control program.
Failure to establish and maintain an effective pest control program may expose animals to illness and disease
hazards.
There is no mechanism in place for the control of rodent pests. An effective pest control program must be
established and maintained.

CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Eight (8) rabbits were housed with six (6) guinea pigs in a large, sheltered, primary enclosure.
Rabbits shall not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals unless required for
scientific reasons. Housing rabbits with other species of animals can stress the rabbits and increase the chance of
injury or illness.
The rabbits must be maintained in an appropriate primary enclosure containing only rabbits.
CORRECTED ON: 10-MARCH-2020; Following inspection, the six (6) guinea pigs were transferred off-premises.
Exit interview was conducted with facility representatives via telephone on 18-MARCH-2020.
