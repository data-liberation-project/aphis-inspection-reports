2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 8:00AM on
04-FEB-20.
We arrived at the facility at about 8am and talked with the licensee who said he was headed to the office and had a
full day of scheduled appointments and would not be able to facilitate an inspection for the day. We discussed
facility representatives and optimal hours/days. The licensee said he would plan on regularly sending us updated
availability information.
