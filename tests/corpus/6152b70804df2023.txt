(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
The enclosure housing 5 lemurs had a buildup of excreta on the ground of the outdoor portion of the enclosure.
The excreta was dried and gray in color, indicating that it had been present for several days or weeks. The lemurs
could not avoid the excreta when walking and sitting on the ground. There was also a swing in the enclosure that
had old, dried excreta on it. This excreta had been mashed down from the lemurs walking on it. Excreta can be a
disease hazard, can attract insects and other pests, and can cause odors. The licensee must remove the excreta
and maintain an effective cleaning program.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(c) Housekeeping for premises.
Two enclosures, housing a total of 6 lemurs, had excessively tall weeds and grass growing along the perimeter of
the enclosures. Tall weeds and grasses provide hiding and breeding areas for pests such as insects, parasites,
rodents, and snakes. Each enclosure also had pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) growing in it. This plant is toxic
when eaten and can result in excessive salivation, stomach pain, and diarrhea. The licensee must trim or remove
the tall weeds around the enclosures and establish an effective program of weed control. The licensee must also
remove the pokeweed inside the enclosures.

The inspection was conducted with a facility representative. The exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
