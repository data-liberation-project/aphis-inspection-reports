SANITATION.
The rodent breeding room had numerous areas along walls and around the water heater where there was an
accumulation of rodent feces and several areas of the insulation wall had holes, indicating a rat or other rodent
problem. A live trap was observed during this inspection. Licensee did state they did have a rodent problem, but
because of the amount of rodent feces present it appears to still be a problem. Insect and rodent pests are a
source of bacteria, viruses, parasites and other possible infectious organisms.
