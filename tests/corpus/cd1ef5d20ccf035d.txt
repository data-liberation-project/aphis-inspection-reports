Currently there is a 100lb sow in North side pen 13 that was recorded as having a completely swollen, fluid filled ear
on December 17, 2014 that was to be treated. Six days later the sow still has not received any treatment and the
ear continues to be fluid filled and stretched to the limits of weight and size for that ear flap. Upon further inspection
there were two other medical issues that had not been observed by the facility Manager and had not been recorded
or received treatment. There is an 80lb sow that is in the finishing barn South side pen 13 with a full right ear
hematoma, or fluid filled ear. The sow had not been noticed with the issue until during the inspection. There is
another sow approximately 100lb in the North side pen 9 that has a bloody tail stump where the tail has been bitten
off. During the inspection 3 other sows continued to bite and chew at her stump which continues to be bloody and
raw. Two of the issues had not been observed until during the inspection, while the one recorded issues still has not
been treated from 6 days prior. At this time the veterinarian has not been contacted in regards to these two health
issues, and no treatments have been given.
Any health issue that is left untreated can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort to the regulated animals. The
lack of response can cause a treatable condition to become chronic or fatal if left undiagnosed and treated for long
periods of time depending on the original condition.
The veterinarian must be contacted to properly diagnose and treat any condition that is required. The licensee must
make sure all conditions are treated according to the veterinarians directions and procedures at all facilities.

resulting in the veterinarian not being contacted or any treatments being provided.
It is important that complete daily observations be conducted of all regulated animals in order to identify any health
issues that appear, in order to prevent any unnecessary pain or discomfort.
The licensee must conduct thorough daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well being. A
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

This was a focused inspection on the NCIs' written on November 25, 2014. The abscess on the neck of the 80lb
sow has been treated and is completely healed. The other sow with the injured leg had been resolved according to
the veterinarians directions. The facility manager had been given proper directions for treatment of abscesses' by
the veterinarian and paperwork for documentation to be kept on all health issues observed in the future. While one
health issue was documented since the past inspection, it still had not received treatment on this date, and the other
two health issues had not been observed or documented on the date of this inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the facility Manager.
