OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The eight plastic shelter structures in the outdoor enclosures that contain seven Huskies and two Shiba Inu dogs do
not have any bedding. The ambient temperature at the time of inspection was recorded at 45.5 degrees F by the
inspector's Kestrel device. According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature for tonight will be
approximately 40 degrees F.
Dogs not provided with clean and dry bedding material during low ambient temperatures can have difficulty
maintaining a safe body temperature. The licensee must provide dry bedding when ambient temperatures are below
50 degrees F and additional bedding when temperatures are below 35 degrees F.
