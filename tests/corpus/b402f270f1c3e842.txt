PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
The facility owner was returning from a mobile exhibit about 70 miles away from the facility with a large
animal/livestock type trailer at the beginning of this inspection. One wire cage housing five young rabbits was
inspected on a shelf built into the forward part of the trailer. The temperature adjacent to the rabbit cage was 94
degrees F (using Kestrel). No auxiliary ventilation devices such as fans, blowers or air conditioners were in use. The
rabbits were all noted to be breathing rapidly and shallowly. The rabbits were immediately moved out of the trailer
and into their home enclosure where they spread themselves out and cooled off. Within approximately 15 minutes
their breathing returned to normal. Rabbits are known to be sensitive to high temperatures which can lead to
heatstroke. The ambient temperature with the animal cargo space shall not exceed 85 deg F. Correct from this day
forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned owner.
