2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection the facility did not have a valid written Program of Veterinary Care. Whereas the facility had been
using several different veterinarians as needed, they had not yet established who their new Attending Veterinarian would
be, and so there was no written plan.

A written Program of Veterinary Care is necessary to help safeguard the welfare of the animals by designating a
veterinarian with the authority and responsibility of overseeing all aspects of care, and on-going communication regarding
any possible medical issues that arise.

The facility should designate who the Attending Veterinarian will be, and work with that person to create a written Program
of Veterinary Care which should be available at the time of any inspection. To be corrected by January 21, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
