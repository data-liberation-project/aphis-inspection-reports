ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The daily observation forms at the facility are incomplete and there is no indication the SOPs are being followed.
The standard operating procedures state animals will be brushed and receive hydrotherapy. There was no
indication or documentation that these activities were conducted. There is minimal to no documentation of
treatments or records that the veterinarian was notified when issues such as coughing, diarrhea, hair loss, eye
issues or decreased appetite were noted during daily observations. Following SOPs and providing frequent and
direct communication with the veterinarian is important for the health and well-being of the animals. The facility must
document treatments and have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with their veterinarian to ensure
timely and accurate treatments of animals.
