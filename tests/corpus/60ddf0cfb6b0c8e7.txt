2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was not a recorded site visit or written program of veterinary care by the attending veterinarian at time of
inspection. Good communication and consultation between the licensee and the attending veterinarian in the form
of a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premise are necessary for the health of
the animals. The licensee must schedule a site visit with the attending veterinarian and keep the recorded
documentation available for inspection.
To be corrected by August 12, 2014.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative at time of inspection.
