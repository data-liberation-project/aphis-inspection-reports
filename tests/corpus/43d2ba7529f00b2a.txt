Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available for review during this inspection. Approximately 410 adult guinea pigs,
weanlings, and newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records maintained for this
calendar year. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying
animal losses by decreased number of guinea pigs born, raised, or died. The licensee must maintain records containing
the required information for animals which disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired or disposed of
including births and deaths. Correct by August 15, 2022.

systems must be operated to minimize pests, odors, and disease hazards. Correct by repairing or replacing the drainage
pipes to prevent waste water and debris from collecting below the animal racks and floor of the animal room. Correct by
