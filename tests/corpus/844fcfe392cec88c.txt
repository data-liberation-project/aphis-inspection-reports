FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A 4 foot fence serves as the perimeter fence at this facility . The fishing cats and north american porcupine are
housed behind a 6 foot perimeter fence however the other animals housed outdoors are only behind the 4 foot
perimeter fence. A fence less than 6 feet high for these animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the
outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or
persons outside the perimeter fence.
