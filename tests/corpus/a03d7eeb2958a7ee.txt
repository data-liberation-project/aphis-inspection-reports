FEEDING.
Primary enclosures used for tigers and a mountain lion all contained elevated, raw wooden, board platforms which
were used to feed meat products to these animals. These platform feeding boards were heavily, stained and
discolored with a build up of blood and food debris which permits possible bacterial contamination and
unwholesomeness of food. An improved and more impermeable surface of feeding must be implemented to allow
for the proper cleaning and sanitation of feeding surfaces used for the animals.
