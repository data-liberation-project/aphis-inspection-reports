2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Complete Description of Animal Use.
1. The amendment to Protocol #522 that was reviewed and approved by the IACUC in Feb 2017 did not contain a
complete description of the proposed animal use.
The original proposal reviewed and approved by the IACUC included a non-survival surgical procedure in sheep.
The amendment reviewed and approved by the IACUC in February 2017 included the significant change to a
survival surgery. Although the study animals currently on this proposal are receiving appropriate veterinary nursing
care for the secondary effects from the surgery, the amendment approved by the IACUC did not include any
description of the possible physical impairment(s) in the study animals as a result of the surgical manipulations nor
was there any description of the monitoring parameters for the possible effects in the sheep post-operatively due to
the surgical manipulations.
Per this Section of the Regulations, proposals to conduct an activity involving animals or to make a significant
change in an ongoing activity involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the
animals so the IACUC can determine that the components of the proposed activities related to the care and use of
animals are in accordance with all of the requirements outlined in this subchapter.
The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for this protocol.
Correct by 3/22/17.
