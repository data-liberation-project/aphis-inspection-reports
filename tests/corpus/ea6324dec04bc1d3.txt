FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.125 Facilities, general.
(a) Structural strength. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The floor, on the rear right portion of the glider room, appeared to be maintaining moisture. The owner explained
that there is a leak in the building that is still in need of repair. This leak, leaving moisture and water on the floor, is a
health hazard for the animals involved. Mold and bacteria can grow under the flooring and in the walls of a
consistantly wet area. Areas housing the animals must be kept in good repair to protect the animals involved.
To Be Corrected by April 15th, 2014.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
(c) Housekeeping. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the
animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of
trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
***There is feed, feces and waste material on the floors and in the troughs in the room housing the sugar gliders.
Poor housekeeping increases the risk of disease. The room shall be cleaned and items for use on the sugar gliders
shall be maintained in a manner that will protect from contamination and minimize disease hazard.
