PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The first rack of wooden pens on the right side has missing paint and chewed wood in enclosures numbered 3 and
4 housing a total of 8 guinea pigs each. The 2 by 2 supports are chewed on the front side. Primary enclosures
including their racks, shelving and other accessories must be constructed of smooth material which is impervious to
moisture and liquids. The chewed wooden supports must be resealed, repaired, or replaced so that all surfaces in
contact with the guinea pigs are impervious to moisture so that they can be repeatedly cleaned and sanitized.
Correct by ensuring that all surfaces in contact with the guinea pigs are impervious to moisture. Correct by June 3,
2017.

self-feeders must be replaced so that the feeders can be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Inadequate cleaning
and sanitation of self-feeders potentially exposes the guinea pigs to disease risks. All food receptacles must be kept
clean and must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by May 17, 2017.
