Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A guinea pig was seen to have hair loss and not using its back legs fully and had some swellings at the back leg joints
(hocks). It was observed to go over and eat and drink water and looked like a young guinea pig also nursed it while I
observed it. The guinea pig's condition of abnormal use of back legs was pointed out to the facility representative during
the inspection. The swellings and hair loss suggest that this condition isn't a new problem for this guinea pig and should
have been observed and communicated to the attending veterinarian. Lack of close observations could cause health
problems to go untreated. The facility must have close daily observations of each animal so that health problems can be
communicated to the attending veterinarian and the veterinarian's treatment plan can be followed. Ensure that this animal
is seen by the attending veterinarian and follow the AV's treatment plan and develop a routine of close daily observations
of each animal in the facility.

Facilities, general.
The food and bedding storage area in the barn had old bags and clutter around the stored pallets. While the facility has
pest control in place, the clutter around the storage could create areas for pests/rodents to live and nest in. Ensure to


maintain the area around food and bedding storage in a manner that protects them from vermin infestation.

3.26(b)

Facilities, indoor.
In the east side of the building the ammonia odors were strong. Ammonia odors can make animals sick and cause them
discomfort. To protect the guinea pigs, ensure that there is enough fresh air flow in the building (while still maintaining the
minimum temperature of 60 degrees F) to minimize ammonia and other odors in the buildings.

3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Some areas that guinea pigs can touch are in disrepair:
-24 feeders were seen to have rusted, rough, and edges that were sharp to the touch. These edges are down where the
guinea pigs would touch the feeders in order to eat. -
-6 feeders in the west new pens had screwpoints from the feeders in areas that guinea pigs could touch them.
-A wire grate underneath the watering valve in the middle north pen under the middle window was bent and had points
exposed to the guinea pigs.
These areas of disrepair with rough and sharp points/edges could hurt the guinea pigs.
Ensure that all surfaces that guinea pigs can touch are free from sharp edges and points to protect the guinea pigs from
injury.

Sanitation.
10 enclosures had excessively soiled, packed, and wet material by either the front of the enclosure or by the watering
area. Also, a strong ammonia odor was smelled around the more soiled enclosures. The facility reports pens are
cleaned out at least every 10 days. If an enclosure is excessively soiled or wet, it must be cleaned sooner to protect the
guinea pigs comfort and help the air quality. Ensure to clean wet soiled excreta often enough to prevent a buildup of wet
material where the guinea pigs live.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
