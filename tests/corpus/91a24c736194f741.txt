3.25(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.25(c) Storage: A stack of three bags of food for the hamsters is stored on the dirty floor. The floor cannot
be easily cleaned under the bags of food. The food may become wet and deteriorate if water gets spilled on the
floor or if the floor is washed. The food must be stored in a manner to prevent contamination and deterioration.
Once the APHIS official identified the bags of food on the dirty floor, the facility personnel put them up off the floor
on a pallet. Corrected during the inspection.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: Enclosures, enclosure lids and miscellaneous items are stored on the floor against
enclosure racks holding enclosures with hamsters. Items may fall on the hamster enclosures and the floor cannot
be adequately cleaned under the stored items. There is food, bedding and debris scattered across the floor.
Rodent feces and debris are accumulating on the floor by the walls and door. This is not sanitary and the food may
attract pests. The ventilation fan is excessively dirty and may be contributing to the dusty conditions in the room.
The tops of the water bottles are excessively dusty. The dust may irritate the eyes and/or respiratory tract of the
hamsters. Premises must be kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
Items necessary for the care of the hamsters must be stored in an organized manner away from the animals and to
allow the room to be adequately cleaned for the health and safety of the animals. The floor, fan and outside of
water bottles must be kept clean for the health of the hamsters. This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains
uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the co-owner.
