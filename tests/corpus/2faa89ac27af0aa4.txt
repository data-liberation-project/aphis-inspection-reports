2.27(a)
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
The registrant is operating a cargo office at San Francisco International Airport for various airlines that transport
animals. The Total Airport Services personnel frequently receive and handle animals in transit for the carriers that
use this cargo office. Total Airport Services failed to renew their registration with USDA / APHIS / Animal Care;
records show that the renewal packet was returned to Animal Care marked as "forward time expired, return to
sender". A Total Airport Services employee told the inspector, at the time of inspection, that their mailing address
had changed some time ago.
Registrants shall notify the Animal Care Regional Director by certified mail of any change in the name, address, or
ownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as an exhibitor, carrier, or intermediate handler, within
10 days after making such change. Failure to provide such notification can result in instances such as this, where
the registration has been cancelled, which could adversely affect the welfare of the animals, since USDA / APHIS /
Animal Care might not be aware of these activities, and therefore potentially unable to enforce the Animal Welfare
Act regulations regarding animals in transit.
The registrant shall refrain from conducting regulated activities until such time as the registration has been renewed.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a Total Airport Services employee at the cargo office at 900
North Access Rd at SFO.
