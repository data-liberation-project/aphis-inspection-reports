Several of the animals have health issues that need addressing by the owner and the veterinarian.
Cat Juja #21 has several mats under his neck. Cat Mickey #22 is severely matted on his entire dorsum. The fur is
dry and dull. Cat Mike #35 has two severely thickened and overgrown claws on the right fore leg. These claws are
curled all the way around to the pad. These cats need to be groomed on a regular basis to prevent fur matts and to
trim nails before they get too long. These items to be corrected by 6-13-14.

Reshe, #5, a 15 year old Eskimo Spitz has heavy buildup of hard brown material on most cheek. The gums are red
above the teeth and retracted slightly.
Kaiser #2, a white Bichon Frise, has a large buildup of brown material on the upper left cheek teeth, and on one
right upper molar.
Babaii #19 has a solid brown buildup of brown material on all upper cheek teeth. He has black waxy exudate in
both ears with the right ear being worse. Both eyes have severe corneal changes with vessels and white covering
the eye.
These three dogs must be seen by the veterinarian. These dogs teeth need to be cleaned under anesthesia by the
veterinary staff so that a more thorough cleaning and preventative can be done, as all of these dogs have had bad
teeth in the recent past..
The written Program of Veterinary Care states all of the dogs and cats are to receive routine vaccinations and
annual heartworm (dogs) and fecal checks. None of the animals are up to date on their vaccinations besides rabies
vaccines. No fecal or heartworm checks have been done, although the veterinary care program states they will be
done annually. The owner last gave heartworm preventative to the dogs in March even though he has it available.
He did not have the veterinarians directions on amounts to give each dog. The licensee needs to follow the written
Program of Veterinary Care as recommended by the veterinarian. Any changes to the written Program of
Veterinary Care need to be documented and approved by the attending veterinarian. To be corrected by 6-25-14.2.40(b)(3)

The owner is not observing the animals to assess their health and well-being on a daily basis. This is especially
evident because of the health issues (matted fur and severely overgrown claws) that three of the cats are
experiencing. The dog Babaii should have been seen for his eyes as soon as any abnormality was noticed. To be
corrected from this day on.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
Inspection conducted at travel location in Conway, SC.
