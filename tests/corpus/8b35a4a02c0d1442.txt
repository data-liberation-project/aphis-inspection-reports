Handling of animals.
An adult English Bulldog, Thor, 8-10 years of age, was transported on HA090 from Honolulu, Air Waybill 173-35702015,
loading at @3:20 pm 07/27/2022, departing at @3:38 pm, and arriving deceased at @ 6:58 am at Boston Logan Airport
on the following day, 7/28/2022. The temperature was reported to be 87.1 F at 3:00 pm at the Honolulu airport on
07/27/22. A necropsy was performed and the pathologist found that brachycephalic syndrome and heat stroke were the
likely cause of death. A brachycephalic older dog is susceptible to the adverse health effects of increased stress and
respiratory effort during travel. Animals must never be subjected to a combination of temperature, humidity and time that
is detrimental to the animal’s health, considering age, breed, and health status. The registrant must ensure that
appropriate measures are taken to alleviate the impact of climactic conditions on the animal.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
