Facilities, general.
There were two open bags of food, two open plastic food containers and an open bag of bedding material in the back

cleaning. Open food and bedding supplies stored in unkept areas attracts vermin or other pests which may transmit
disease and contaminate the food. Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in facilities which adequately protect
such supplies against deterioration, molding or contamination by vermin to ensure the health and well-being of all the
