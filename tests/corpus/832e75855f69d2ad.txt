ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One male and two female Newfoundland dogs were observed in an outside kennel area with access to an
outbuilding with a dirt floor. Upon entering the building for inspection, the inspector heard a faint squeaking noise
coming from under a metal food receptacle. Behind and under the food receptacle was a hole in the dirt with 8
Newfoundland puppies. The puppies appear to be very young, their eyes were still closed, their hair coats were
soiled, and are too young to move out of the hole on their own. The dam(cid:25)s haircoat was soiled, and she had
difficulty accessing the puppies in this area.
The pen is muddy. The area is not easily accessible to the licensee or the female dog. The hole is oval in shape,
roughly 24 inches across, appears to be 18 inches deep, extends outside the building, and is partially blocked by
the metal enclosure above it. The licensee advised he was not aware that the puppies were there. He also stated he
did not have an appropriate facility to house the dam and puppies at that time. The licensee must provide
appropriate facilities to house female dogs and their puppies to keep the puppies clean, allow the female to access
and care for the pups, and protect the puppies from extreme temperatures, soiling, and other animals.
The licensee must provide these animals with appropriate housing facilities. The licensee must establish and
maintain programs of veterinary care that include the availability of appropriate facilities for all animals.

3.6(a)(2)(8) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The dirt hole inside the enclosure where the puppies are located is not easily accessible by the dam. The size of the
hole makes it difficult for the puppies to nurse properly and be cared for by the dam. The dam cannot lay down on
her side in a normal position to allow the puppies to nurse. The puppies were vocalizing at the time of the
inspection. The pen is muddy and the puppies and dam have soiled hair coats. Puppies must have easy andconvenient access to nurse in order to have adequate nutrition.
The licensee must provide these animals with housing that allows the puppies to easily access the dam to nurse.
The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that they provide all the
dogs with easy and convenient access to clean food and water.
