3.127(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The owner has been updating and improving the shelter situation since the last inspection and is still in the process
of repairs and providing shelters. In addition, some of the animals have been moved around/have access to
different enclosures/pastures since the last inspection. Heavy rains occurred yesterday and overnight.
*The sheep and goats (total 27 animals) are in the front pasture and have access to a new red four sided shed with
an opening in one side. The owner reports they were all in the shelter during the storm yesterday however
additional shelter should be provided as the shelter size is a very tight fit for all the currently housed sheep and
goats.
*The llamas and alpacas along with two donkeys are in the enclosure pasture directly behind the house. They do
not currently have access to a shelter structure and did not overnight. The animals' haircoats appear wet. The two
alpaca's haircoats appear completely soaked.
*The pigs, cows and zebus all have appropriate shelter.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to local climatic conditions for the species concerned must be provided for the
animals kept outdoors to provide protection and prevent discomfort.
This is a focused inspection on the direct non-compliances cited on the last inspection report.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
