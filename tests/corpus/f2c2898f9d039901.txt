INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
** Approved protocol #D10-2014-14 had undergone changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing
activities that were not being reported to the IACUC without an approved modification.
According to records dated November 19, 2015, a dog (patient #52181) was admitted to the hospital for euthanasia
and was misappropriated to practice emergency surgical procedures before being euthanized as requested by client
#84574.
According to records dated May 1, 2015, a dog (patient #8109) was transferred to the protocol without notification
and approval by IACUC and, had undergone emergency surgical procedures and euthanasia.
According to the "(cid:28)Dogs Allotment Record(cid:29)" there were 12 dogs (animals #8118, #8120, #8115, #8127, #8123,
#8147, #8186, #8190, # 8109, #8224, #52181 and #8225) that had undergone emergency surgical procedures after
the protocols approved expiration date of May 1, 2015. Also the "Dogs Allotment Record" listing the 20 dogs
approved for the protocol does not reflect the 2 extra dogs that were inappropriately transferred from sources not
specified in the approved protocol and used to practice emergency surgical procedures.
Based on record review, there was no supporting documentation that stated that the PI had an IACUC approved
extension in his protocol. Unapproved significant changes to the protocol could result in unanticipated pain and
distress, and put the animal's welfare at risk. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be reviewed
and approved by the IACUC prior to implementing the changes.
The research facility acted to address these items by conducting an investigation and further implementing
appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. The Principal Investigator has been suspended from
being included or from participating in any research activity with protocols involving dogs. There have not been any
additional incidents since the corrective actions were implemented.
2.31(d)(5)INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol D10-2014-14 was investigated by IACUC for unapproved activity of the protocol and misuse of dogs.
Record review indicated that the animal activities are not being conducted as outlined in the protocol. IACUC had
not reviewed the protocol in over a year and activity had continued since May 1, 2015 which was the projects end
date. Continuing review of animal activities is necessary in order to ensure that all animal activities are conducted in
compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations. The IACUC must conduct a review of the activities involved in
the aforementioned protocol and ensure that all animal activities are conducted as stated in the protocol, or that the
protocol is amended to reflect the activities as they are conducted.
The research facility acted to address this item by conducting an investigation and further implementing appropriate
corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. IACUC has decided to review protocols semi-annually to better
monitor research activity. There have not been any additional incidents since the corrective actions were
implemented.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
** There were two dogs (animals #8109 & #52181) that were not approved for use that were inappropriately
transferred to protocol # D10-2014-14. These dogs were used to practice emergency surgical procedures and there
aren't any record of the procedures conducted. The research facility shall maintain pre-procedural and
post-procedural care that pertains to the procedures conducted on the animals of concern. Lack of sufficient
medical records stating procedures performed leaves uncertainty of whether the proper pre and post-procedural
care given was adequate and in good congruence with current established veterinary medicine.
The research facility acted to address this item by conducting an investigation and further implementing appropriate
corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. The PI has been instructed to attend training involving record
keeping. There have not been any additional incidents since the corrective actions were implemented.
2.38(k)(2)

nor was the owner notified of the inappropriate transfer of the animal for practicing emergency surgical procedures.
No person shall obtain live dogs by use of false pretenses, misrepresentation, or deception.
The research facility acted to address this item by conducting an investigation and further implementing appropriate
corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. The IACUC has suspended the Principal Investigators activities
involving dogs. There have not been any additional incidents since the corrective actions were implemented.This was a focused inspection.
