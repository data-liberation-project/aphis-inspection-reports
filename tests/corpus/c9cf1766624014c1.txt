2.40 b 2 - Program of Vet Care.
At time of inspection the written program of veterinary care had incomplete information pertaining to the parasite
control at the facility. The section pertaining to ectoparasites, blood parasites, and intestinal parasits had the words
"as needed" listed in this section. When "as needed" is listed under the frequency of sampling or treatment the
licensee is providing the dogs, it is not considered to be adequate veterinary care. The licensee, in coordination with
the attending veterinarian, must provide more specific information on the type of products used at the facility and the
frequency of use. The licensee must ensure that the program of veterinary care is updated with current preventive
practices to ensure that the dogs are provided adequate veterinary care. To be corrected by 04-11-14.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
3.11 d - Pest Control.
At time of inspection there were roaches crawling on the floor of the shelter building housing forty six dog. Lack of
an effective program that controls pests can create unsanitary conditions and lead to potential spread of disease.
No bait, bait traps or other means to control or eliminate the pests were viewed during the inspection. The licensee
must establish an effective program of pest control in the kennel area that is necessary for the health and well being
of the animals. To be corrected by 03-21-14.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
