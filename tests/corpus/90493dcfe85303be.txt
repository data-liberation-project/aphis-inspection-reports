2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
Licensing Requirements.
1. The individual identified above operates a mobile petting zoo business ("Farm Visits") that includes species of
animals used in activities regulated by the Animal Welfare Act AWA (rabbits, pigs, and goats) but the individual
does not have a USDA Class "C" exhibitor license. Although the individual was contacted in November 2013 and
informed of the license requirement to operate a mobile petting zoo, an application for a license has not been
submitted and un-licensed Class "C" animal use activities are being conducted.
Per this Section of the Regulations, any person operating or intending to operate as an exhibitor must have a valid
license with the USDA. The possession of a valid USDA license demonstrates that the premises, vehicles,
equipment, and care of the animals complies with the Regulations and Standards as set forth in the AWA to ensure
the health and well-being of the animals.
An application for a license should be submitted to the Regional Director that contains all of the information
requested on the application form, including a valid mailing address through which the applicant can be reached at
all times, and a valid premises address where animals, animal facilities, equipment, and records may be inspected
for compliance.
NOTE - This SEARCH inspection was a focused inspection to verify the conduction of un-licensed AWA Regulated
activity. A valid USDA Class "C" exhibitor license is required in order to continue to exhibit animals to the public.
The licensing requirements and USDA Regulations that apply to this type of facility were discussed and a
pre-license packet was left by the inspectors.
No further USDA regulated activities should be conducted until a USDA license is obtained.
NOTE - Exit interview held on-site 3/17/16 with the Owner by APHIS AC VMOs Dr. Paula Gladue and Dr. Tonya
Hadjis. Inspection report delivered 3/18/16 by e-mail.Additional Inspectors
