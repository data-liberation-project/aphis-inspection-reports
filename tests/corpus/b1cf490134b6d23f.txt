2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions that were not being treated as described in the Program
of Veterinary Care. A brown and white weanling in Pen 16L had a circular area of hair loss approximately 2 cm in
diameter on the right hip and the skin in this area was scaly. An adult tri-color guinea pig in pen 15R had an area of
hair loss approximately 1 cm in diameter below the right ear. The licensee stated he had observed the skin issues
but was not applying any treatments to these animals. The Program of Veterinary Care describes treating lesions
like this with various medications including captan powder, Lamisil, or lotrimin lotion.
Skin abnormalities with hair loss and scaling skin can worsen or may spread to other animals if infectious in nature.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or consult with the attending
veterinarian regarding the skin conditions observed in the two guinea pigs.
3.25(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The height of the front and side walls of several of the enclosures was approximately 6.5 inches. Although no loose
guinea pigs were observed, walls that are not high enough pose a risk that animals may escape the enclosure and
result in possible injury or be unable to access food and water. Correct by ensuring wall height is at least 7 inches
in order to contain the animals and protect them from injury.
Remains uncorrected.
3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In several of the guinea pig pens, the wooden sides of the enclosure are chewed, worn down, and have exposed
unsealed wood. Additionally, the back walls of the guinea pig enclosures had wire attached to the wall in order to
increase wall height. The wire, however, was cut so that there are exposed wire tips that are within reach of the
guinea pigs. These wire tips were present for every square of wire, which was approximately 1in x 1 in.Primary enclosures for guinea pigs need to be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and be constructed of
material substantially impervious to moisture. The wire tips can cause injury to the guinea pigs and the chewed,
exposed wood can increase the spread of disease through improper sanitation. Correct by trimming the wire tips
and repairing or replacing all chewed, exposed wood.
Remains uncorrected.
3.30 REPEAT
WATERING.
Several of the the PVC pipes underneath the water spigots in the guinea pig enclosures have a build-up of bedding,
feces, and greenish/brown wet material. The connecting lines to the water nipples have a build-up of dark green
material inside the lines.
All watering receptacles need to be kept clean and free of debris. Failure to do so can lead to the spread of disease
or illness due to the avoidance of water. Correct by sanitizing water receptacles when found to be dirty and at a
minimum of once every two weeks.
Remains uncorrected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
