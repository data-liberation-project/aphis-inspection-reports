2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One blue and white adult female Italian Greyhound with number 933 has a loose canine tooth with a recessed
gum line on the lower right side. The lower left canine tooth is not mobile but is protruding out of the mouth at about
a 45 degree angle to upright and has a recessed gum line. There is a coating of tarter on the lower left premolar
teeth (cheek teeth). One of the lower left premolar teeth is loose and has a collection of white discharge at the gum
line.
* One white colored adult female Schnauzer with number 653 has a buildup of tarter on the canines and premolars.
The gum line over all of the upper premolar teeth on both sides is recessed with copious amounts of white, creamy
discharge present in this space. There is a collection of matted hair lodged at the base of the lower left incisors and
canine tooth.
Loose teeth, recessed gums and discharge at the gum line are some of the signs of dental disease in dogs. Dental
disease can cause damage to the gum tissue, tooth and mouth structures (such as bone loss in the jaw), can be
painful, and can impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The animals
listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained
and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment
and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
*******************************************
* Two black and tan colored adult male Dachshund (numbers 1004 and 006) and one salt and pepper colored
adult male Schnauzer number 64 have matted hair. Matted hair was observed on the ears and back legs of the two
Dachshunds and over the entire body of the Schnauzer. The matted hair was balled and ropey in appearance and
was tightly adhered to the skin. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and moisture and can
foster skin infections. The matted hair on these dogs must be removed and a program of coat maintenance must be
established at the facility.
***************************************** Italian Greyhound numbers 135 and 138 cited on the December 8, 2015 inspection report under 2.40 b 2 are
currently under a treatment plan with the attending veterinarian.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Two enclosures housing four dogs have wet, clumped shredded paper accumulating on 75 percent of the
enclosure flooring. In addition, at least four enclosures housing 14 dogs have excreta accumulating on 50 percent
of the cement floor. The affected flooring is located in indoor and sheltered housing. The licensee stated that the
affected enclosures were last cleaned approximately four days ago. Daily removal of all excreta and clumped wet
shredded paper is necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of excreta and wet clumpy shredded paper.
This will help to reduce any disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. Unsanitary living conditions from the
excreta and wet clumped shredded paper exist that could lead to potential contamination, soiling or caking of the
hair coat. The licensee must ensure that excreta and wet clumped shredded paper must be removed from the
primary enclosure on a daily basis. Correct by 3/1/16.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 2/29/16 were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver
VMO and Robert Bacon ACI.
