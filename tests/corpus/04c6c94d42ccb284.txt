Facilities, general.
1. On the previous inspection (5/6/2021) it was noted that the green vinyl fencing, on the primary fencing, for the goat
enclosure was detaching. That exposed jagged edges and gaps. This situation was still present during this inspection.
And there was also a section of fence between the two sheep enclsoure that was also bowing upwards and had jagged
edges present. To ensure that the animals are securely contained, and not injured on this fencing, these areas will need
to be addressed.

2. During this inspection it was noted that the trailer that is being used for 2 sheep has a wooden floor. However, the wood
slats, along the edges, have begun to splinter, crack, and bow upwards. To ensure that the sheep are not injured on these
jagged edges and gaps, this flooring needs to be addressed.

During this inspection it was noted that the substrate in the alpaca enclosure was very wet. The entire enclosure, except
for the shelter / trailer, was approximately 3" deep of wet mud. These 14 animals have no access to dry areas. To ensure

their health and protect their feet from any issues, the substrate needs to be addressed.
