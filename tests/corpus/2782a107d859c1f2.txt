2.33(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
There was no written program of veterinary care available at time of inspection. The facility representative provided a
SOP that was titled "Veterinary Care" but it was written and signed off by a former laboratory employee on 7-Aug-2020.
This "Veterinary Care" document was dated 25-Aug-2020 and contained four other signatures of company officials.
There was no signature by any attending veterinarian. The facility representative was told by the inspector that this was
not considered a valid written program of veterinary care and that a document that was generated by the current attending
veterinarian was needed. She could not locate it because it did not exist. Later that day on a telephone conversation with
the QC Manager, (who was not present at time of inspection), the inspector was informed that “The previous attending
veterinarian had submitted a letter of resignation last week." The QC Manager then e-mailed the inspector a copy of the
old program of veterinary care written by the former attending veterinarian who had resigned.

It is important for the attending veterinarian to have appropriate authority to ensure the provisions of adequate veterinary
care and to actively oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Attending veterinarians must have an
active role in writing the program of veterinary care. The written program of veterinary care should include preventive
care, parasite control, emergency care, contact information including telephone number of attending veterinarian for


relaying communication on daily observations, and other treatment guidance including euthanasia guidelines and other
applicable program topics such as common diseases, afflictions, welfare, pest control and animal handling.

In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a
written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the research facility by the attending veterinarian.

2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Daily observation requirements were found to be lacking. A new employee was questioned about her job duties during
the animal facility inspection. When asked by the inspector, (about performing daily observations), what the employee
would do if she saw an animal with something wrong, she replied “ I‘m not sure.” She indicated that she did not know who
to contact and had not been given a contact number when probed by the inspector.

Guidance by the attending veterinarian is necessary to ensure the provisions of adequate veterinary care and to oversee
the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. If the attending veterinarian is not contacted concerning problems
found on daily observations, then there is no priority placed on assessing the animal’s health and well-being and no
professionally directed remedy for the animal. If daily observation findings are not being relayed to the attending
veterinarian then the attending veterinarian must have the authority to perform the daily observations himself.

Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being must be performed. Daily observations may be
accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian if there is a timely and accurate relay of information.


There must be a mechanism of direct frequent communication that is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

2.33(b)(4)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
At time of inspection the employee hired to work with and care for the guinea pigs had not been adequately trained. On
inspection of the new euthanasia facilities, the employee said that she had not been trained on the procedure when
probed by the inspector.

Adequate training is necessary to ensure the safety of the operator and the humane treatment of the animals.

Guidance to personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia,
tranquilization, and euthanasia must be provided.
