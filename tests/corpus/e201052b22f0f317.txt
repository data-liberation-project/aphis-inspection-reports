Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On August 17th, a pig was used in a cardiovascular study procedure. The pig was recovered from anesthesia by
laboratory personnel and transferred to the recovery suite at 3:20PM. It was noted by laboratory staff that the pig had
minimal movement in its hind end. The laboratory staff continued to monitor the pig but noted no change in the hindlimbs.
Laboratory staff communicated with the Investigator on call about the pig’s progress. The Investigator on call elected not
to contact the DVR Veterinarian about the pig’s hindlimbs. The laboratory staff left the facility at 12:30AM noting no signs
of pain or distress from the pig.

On August 18th during morning rounds, a DVR veterinary technician went to assess the pig’s condition, check the
Fentanyl patch, and jacket placement. After examining the pig, the technician determined that the hindlimbs showed no
signs of movement and immediately contacted the on-call clinical veterinarian. The veterinarian assessed the pig,
concluded that pig did have bilateral hindlimb paralysis and the pig was euthanized.

Direct and frequent communication of daily observations is required so that timely and accurate information on problems
of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.



This was corrected by IACUC suspending the laboratory’s animal use, drafting reports to notify the appropriate federal
agencies and accrediting associations, retraining of all laboratory staff, and implementing a corrective action plan.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility represenatives.
