Feeding.
There is a single male rabbit housed in a rabbit hutch. There is a self feeder in the rabbit hutch that has a large area,
approximately 1/4, of caked feed on one side.

If self feeders are used for the feeding of dry feed to rabbits, measures must be taken to prevent molding, deterioration or
caking of the feed.

Clean self feeders for rabbits often enough to prevent caking of the food. Caked rabbit feed has deteriorated and may not
contain complete nutrition.

Feeding.
Since the last inspection a squirrel monkey was euthanized. A necropsy was performed by Michigan State University.
The necropsy report stated that “The gross and histologic findings are consistent with trauma and a chronic negative
energy balance.”


If members of dominant nonhuman primate or other species are fed together with other nonhuman primates, multiple
feeding sites must be provided. The animals must be observed to determine that all receive a sufficient quantity of food.

All non-human primates must be fed a sufficient quantity of food, and observed to ensure they are consuming an
appropriate amount of food to maintain their health.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The primary enclosure for the 3 squirrel monkey has excess food and feces on the floor, and the elevated platform.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from inside each indoor primary enclosure daily and from underneath them as
often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the nonhuman primates
from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.

Feces and excess food waste must removed from indoor primary enclosures daily to prevent soiling of the primates,
reduce disease hazards, and odors.

Sanitation.
-The shelter in the primary enclosure for the 3 camels has excessive feces and urine in it. There is a strong odor present
in the area.
-There is a single cow housed with an Asian water buffalo in a barn with no access to the outside. The cow and buffalo
are standing on approximately 16" of manure pack.
-There are 2 intact, male goats that are housed in a barn and are standing on approximately 12" of manure pack.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

Manure and wet, soiled bedding must be removed from primary enclosures to prevent contamination of the animals,
minimize disease hazard and reduce odors
