3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is one outdoor enclosure housing two raccoons that is located outside of the perimeter fence. A perimeter
fence is required around these animals in order to protect them from unauthorized persons and other animals and to
provide for a secondary containment system. All outdoor facilities housing regulated animals must be enclosed by a
perimeter fence. It must be of sufficient distance (3 feet or more) from the outside of the primary enclosure to
prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside of the perimeter
fence.

SANITATION.
Within both the skunk building, housing eight skunks, and the woodchuck building, housing eight woodchucks, there
is an excessive amount of cobwebs, dust, dirt, and clutter present in close proximity to the animal enclosures. The
cobwebs are mainly located on the walls, ceilings and light fixtures within both of the buildings. Some of the
cobwebs are very thick with a thick layer of dust clinging to them. The clutter near the enclosures is mostly
old/unused husbandry items such as old and/or unused caging. The clutter in the woodchuck building also includes
on old tractor tire, other old farm equipment, and a chair. The clutter in the woodchuck building is covered with a
thick layer of dust, dirt and/or debris. The premises (building and grounds area) needs to be kept clean and free of
excessive cobwebs, dust, dirt, debris and/or clutter in order to protect the animals from injury, facilitate husbandry
practices, and eliminate pest breeding grounds. The premises needs to be cleaned, clutter needs to be removed
and a routine schedule for cleaning needs to be established.
