PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
A lab group was found on April 2, 2019 to be conducting a surgery with poor sterile technique. Department of
Comparative Medicine (DCM) veterinarians and technicians in attendance stepped in to ensure the welfare of the
ferret. This pilot surgery ran into unexpected anatomical complications, and the animal was euthanized under
anesthesia. The materials and methods for this euthanasia were not on the approved protocol.
The lab’s training records were not current prior to the incident – copies provided were back-filled with training
information and dates after the deficiencies in the lab were noted in April. The IACUC did not have personnel
qualification information available at the time the protocol was approved.
The mitigation plan included a training covering scrubbing and gowning on 5/21/19. Two of the people in that
training under the lab’s protocol number are not listed as personnel on the approved protocol. It is unclear if they
have participated in procedures.
The IACUC must evaluate qualifications of all personnel on the protocol, and ensure all personnel are listed on the
protocol, as part of the approval process.
Correct by ensuring all aspects of Section 2.32 are met prior to approving protocols from this point forward.
2.33(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In the same lab, there were containers of dressing supplies used for ferret cap care on the bench. The containers
appeared dirty, and had large areas of corrosion on the lids and under the lid. The containers held gauze for
cleaning and non-stick pads for dressing the caps.
Corroded metal cannot be adequately cleaned, disinfected, or sterilized. Their use is not appropriate for procedures
requiring clean or sterile technique because they can harbor pathogens which may result in infection.
Correct by using containers able to be properly cleaned and disinfected or sterilized from this point forward.
2.33(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
At the time of inspection, the same lab had a ferret (#100951) in a restraint for training and cap care. The ferret hada strong foul odor, and the cap margins were moist with crusty exudate. A second ferret (#270877B) in a holding
cage was rubbing its head cap on the fabric of a hammock. Review of the protocol revealed that rubbing or itching
of the surgery site will trigger notification to the DCM. Neither animal had been reported to the AV in the DCM. Both
animals were immediately examined by DCM veterinarians and a treatment plan was initiated.
Correct by ensuring that, from this point forward, all animal use personnel are aware of the daily observation
requirements in this section, and that they know that they must immediately report problems to the Attending
Veterinarian.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted on June 3, 4, and 6, 2019 with facility personnel.
