3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
There are multiple areas of clutter and accumulation of items on the floor of the south room of the house adjacent to the
kitchen area. This is an area where dogs are allowed to roam freely in the house. There were six dogs going in and out of
the area during the inspection.

Accumulation of items on the floor that are not necessary for daily husbandry practices may hinder the ability to
adequately clean and sanitize dog contact areas. Clutter may also predispose the area to vermin and pest infestation.
Animal housing areas must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture and stored materials.

Non-compliance under 3.1(b) had been previously identified and reported on inspection on 04DECEMBER2019.
3.1(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
There is one kennel located on the south side of the kennel building which has multiple areas of perforated/corroded tin
surrounding the dog doorway. There are areas with exposed edges where the tin is missing or has corroded away.



Areas of perforation/corrosion with resulting exposed tin edges may be difficult to adequately clean and sanitize and may
also pose a potential injury risk to dogs entering and exiting through the doorway. Interior surfaces and any surfaces that
come in contact with dogs must be free of excessive rust that prevent the required cleaning and sanitation, or affects the
structural strength of the surface.
To be corrected by 25 APRIL 2021.
3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Inside the house there are multiple areas with accumulation of grime and debris on the floor, cabinet, plastic tote and
under areas where items are being stored between the kitchen and south entry room area. There were 6 dogs freely
roaming in the house at the time of inspection. There was also a strong odor of urine present during the inspection.

A buildup of grime and debris on and between surfaces makes it more difficult to adequately clean and sanitize the
affected surfaces. Strong odors may also be an indication of inadequate cleaning and sanitation. Primary enclosures and
enclosure furnishings used for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed
in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste,
excreta, and other disease hazards.

Non-compliance under 3.11 (b)(2) was previously identified on the previous inspections and reports dated 08MAY2018
and 22APRIL2019 and 04DECEMBER2019.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
