HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There are various exotic species at the facility, which include zebra, camels, kangaroo and capybara. The personnel
at the time of inspection were not trained and did not have the experience on how to adequately manage these
species. All licensees with wild or exotic animals must demonstrate experience and knowledge of the species they

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.At the time of inspection, public barriers for various animal exhibits were non-existant and this allowed the public to
have contact with the animals. There were also no readily identified employees. A public barrier of less than 3 feet
was in place at the camel enclosure and a large gap was directly above the gate of the zebra enclosure which also
allowed an opportunity for public contact. Due to the size and nature of these species, a public barrier must be
constructed and/or trained identified employees must be present at these exhibits at all times.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of inspection, a capybara was housed in a outdoor enclosure with a three-walled shelter. The
temperature was at 32 degrees and the shelter in the exhibit does not provide adequate protection from inclement
weather. The water source for swimming must be removed during the cold weather to prevent the capybara from
using the tub and suffering from hypothermic conditions. A shelter with better insulation must be constructed for the
animal to prevent it from being exposed to the colder temperature.
