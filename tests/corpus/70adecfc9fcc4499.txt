2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1020 on
22-Jun-17. We went to the house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked my car horn. I called the
licensee by phone and left a message. I did not receive a call back. We waited 30 minutes and then left the
property.
End of report.
