3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
There is a section of chain link fence in the exercise yard that is not secured at the base of the fence and is creating a gap
in the section of fence. This section of fence needs to be addressed to keep the enclosure in good repair for the safety of
the dogs.

There are also several fence panels in the yard leaning up against the side of the building. These panels could be a safety
hazard if they fall down and should be secured to prevent possible injury to the dogs.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
*** There was an abundance of flies in the sheltered portion of the kennel. The facility had fly strips that they have not put
up yet to mitigate the number of flies in the area. An effective program for the control of insects, affecting dogs must be
established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests
in animal areas.
