2.31(b)(3)(2) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The unaffiliated member has resigned since the last IACUC meeting. As a result, the required IACUC membership
is not complete. The unaffiliated member is intended to provide representation for the general community interests
in the proper care and treatment and use of animals, and is thus, essential to the committee. A system should be in
place to ensure IACUC membership is complete, and in the event a required member resigns, a replacement is
appointed in a timely manner.
The new public member recently quit and there is no public member on the committee currently.
The facility needs to seek and acquire the public member to fill the vacant position as soon as possible.
This is a repeat non compliant item originally documented on March 5, 2015
2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual report does not indicate who the report was sent to.
The IACUC, with respect to activities involving animals and as an agent of the research facility, must perform the
function of preparing its semiannual evaluations and then submitting them to the Institutional Official in a timely
manner to keep the Institutional Official adequately informed and to comply with the regulatory requirements.
One minor deficiency was noted (bird feces on the hay) on the semi-annual review with no plan of correction.

2.31(d)(1)INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocols do not address the assurance statements as required by the regulations. This would include
procedures involving animals that will avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals; the principal
investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or
distress to the animals, and has provided a written narrative description of the methods and sources; does not
unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments; addresses painful procedures if needed; their living conditions; their
medical care; that the personnel are properly trained; and use of proper euthanasia if needed. For the health and
well-being of the animals, these items need to be addressed the animal use protocols.
To be corrected by: all new protocols or by 3/8/2016
2.31(d)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There is no documentation that the committee notified the Principle Investigator or the Institutional Official of the
committee decisions on the approved protocols. IACUC shall notify principal investigators and the research facility
in writing of its decision to approve or withhold approval of those activities related to the care and use of animals, or
of modifications required to secure IACUC approval.

2.31(d)(6)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The principle investigator resigned several weeks ago and the active animal use protocols are no longer are valid.
No new principle investigator has been assigned to these protocols. The IACUC needs to suspend any activity that
it previously approved, and all protocols need to be approved with the new principle investigator.
