**** One enclosure containing three dogs has one metal self feeder has excessive rust on the door and bottom and
now has jagged edges. The rusted surface inhibits the ability to clean and sanitize properly. The rust can
contaminate the food and the jagged edges can injure the dogs while eating. Need to repair or replace the feeder to
protect the feed from contamination and prevent the dogs from injuring themselves.
