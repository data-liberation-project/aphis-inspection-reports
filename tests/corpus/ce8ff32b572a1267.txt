3.75(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- There was standing water and numerous food items in a drainage ditch along one entire exterior side of the
primate medical building. The standing water is a result of rainwater accumulation and waste draining from the
inside portion of their enclosures. There are drain pipes from the indoor portion of the enclosures that drain into an
approximately 2 foot wide area directly behind the medical building. The primate shift area is directly above this
drainage area, and the outside portion of this primate enclosure is adjacent to this standing water. This is
essentially an open sewer, and is present due to facility employees not maintaining this drainage ditch in a proper
manner. Improper drainage systems and standing water where the animals are contained may result in noxious
odors, spreading of diseases, insect infestation and other health hazards. This area needs to have a more
permanent drainage solution, rather than relying on daily employee maintenance. All pens housing animals must
have an adequate drainage system that is able to eliminate standing water and waste more rapidly for the overall
health of the animals.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was a very large pool of standing water in an enclosure housing three tigers. The pool of water divided the
enclosure approximately in half, and was large enough that there was no dry path available for the animals to move
from one end of the enclosure to the other. A single tiger on one end of the enclosure was visibly reluctant to enter
the water and was clearly uncomfortable as he crossed the pool. Standing pools of water should not reduce the
usable size of the enclosure, and should not be a physical barrier or source of discomfort to the enclosed animals.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water and the drainage system maintained to
ensure that the condition does not recur.
