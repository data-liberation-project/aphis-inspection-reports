3.75(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On March 19, 2016, a juvenile female siamang named Tika escaped from her outdoor exhibit enclosure. According
to written employee incident statements, Tika was recaptured by zoo employees without injury within 1 hour of the
time it was discovered that she had escaped from her enclosure.
The coated wire (1/2" x 2"mesh) in this outdoor exhibit has been in place for at least 20 years according to zoo
employees. Records reviewed at the time of the inspection indicate that zoo employees were aware of the need to
replace this mesh since April 2014, but were not able to secure funding for the project at that time.
Upon review of zoo documents and discussion with zoo employees, it appears that a significant contributing factor
to
Tika's escape was that a small area of the outdoor exhibit mesh had failed due to deterioration from rubbing against
a tree branch and the age of the wire. Tika was able to escape from her outdoor exhibit through this area where the
mesh had broken. All enclosures housing non-human primates must be designed and constructed so that they are
structurally sound for the species housed inside them and contain the animals securely.
This is a Critical Noncompliance Item (NCI).


3.105(d)FEEDING.
In the zoo commissary walk-in freezer, a large buildup of ice was noted on the boxes of trout which are used to
feed
the polar bears and pinnipeds. One cardboard box containing frozen trout (as well as the inner protective plastic
bag)
was left open, causing the fish to become discolored, dry, and brittle (freezer burn). Food storage and handling
must
be conducted in a manner which assures the wholesomeness and nutritive value of the food. All food items must
be
maintained in a manner which minimizes contamination and protects food quality until the time of feeding.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
In the zoo commissary, a large amount of rodent fecal material was noted on the floor of the dry food storage room.
Three small holes, which appear to have been created by rodents, were noted in the walls of this food storage area.
Although snap traps and sticky boards were currently in use at the time of the inspection, the program for rodent
control does not appear to be effective in this food storage area. Rodent feces may contaminate food and
contribute
to the spread of disease. A safe and effective program for the control of rodent pests must be established and
maintained in order to prevent contamination of the food stored in this area.

Inspection conducted on June 6-7, 2016 with facility representatives. Exit briefing conducted with facility
representatives on June 7, 2016.
