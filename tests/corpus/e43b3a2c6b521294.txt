3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a lack of adequate perimeter fencing around an enclosure housing one Patagonian Cavy. The enclosure
does have a perimeter fence on the east side of the enclosure but is lacking on the other 3 sides. An incomplete
perimeter fence does not protect the animal by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from having
contact with the animal. Also, without a complete perimeter fence there is no secondary containment system. A six
foot perimeter fence must be provided for the Patagonian Cavy enclosure to keep unauthorized persons and
unwanted animals from having contact with the cavy and provide a secondary containment system in the event of
escape.
