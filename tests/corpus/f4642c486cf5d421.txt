Female Shih tzu (tag #479) is showing signs of severe heat stress including open mouth breathing, high rate of
respiration, the tongue extending from the mouth beyond the teeth, and reddened skin. The dog was making a loud raspy
noise when she breathed and appeared to be gasping for breath. The dog is also expressing other behaviors indicating
she may be suffering from the ambient temperature such as laying sprawled across the floor and weak, unstable and
uncoordinated movements especially in her hind end. The dog was located in an outdoor shelter and had difficulty exiting
the shelter ultimately dragging her hind legs over the lip of the shelter entrance. Temperatures taken inside the shelter
ranged from 91 degrees F to 93 degrees F with a heat index of 107 degrees F to 109 degrees F. The facility
representative stated the dog had housed inside the sheltered building and moved to the outdoor enclosure that morning
and the dog had not been unstable or had difficulty with her hind legs before. The facility representative was not aware of
the dog's condition until the dog was found by the inspectors.

Heat stress could be detrimental to the health of the dog and can even result in death.

Female Cavalier spaniel (#492) has a large raw lesion on the inside of the right hind leg. The area is devoid of hair, is
wet, and appears inflammed and slightly reddened. Other areas of skin irritation are located along the inside of the left

leg with some hair loss and slight reddening of the skin. The hair around the affected areas is heavily matted, wet, tight to
the skin and has thick dark colored material trapped in it. Heavily matted hair is also located along the length of the
underside of the tail and has fresh and dried fecal material coating it. A greenish colored discharge is located on the
lower eyelids. Both wet and dry discharge is attached to the hair of the lower eyelids and a small amount is attached to
the interior section of the upper eyelids. Some straw was observed to be stuck in the discharge beneath the right eye.
The dog also has long rope-like mats attached to both ears and the mats are solid and coated with a dried grey material.
The facility representative was not aware of this dog's condition.

Abnormal skin and eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort
and pain and could also lead to further health issues.

Female Cocker Spaniel (tag #309) has poor ear health and a matted hair coat. The inside of the left ear is moderately
reddened, inflammed, and wet with a yellow liquid coating some of the ear's surfaces and attached from one surface to
another. The hair around the underside of the ear is wet with a dark brown material coating it. Long ropes of matted hair
are attached to the top of the dog's head and in front of the dog's left eye. The licensee was not aware of this dog's
condition.

Poor ear health could be painful to the dog and matted hair could also cause discomfort and pain to the animal as well as
lead to further health issues.

Female Pekingese (tag #460) has an abnormal skin condition and matted hair. Multiple lesions were identified across the
dog's back in front of the tail head. The areas are hairless, slightly reddened and wet. One affected area appeared as a

hole in the dog's back surrounded by heavily matted hair. The dog appeared sensitive and began to struggle only when
the affected areas were gently inspected. Excessively matted hair is located along the backside of both hindlegs and tail.
The hair is matted into large clumps. A large engorged tick is located on the dog's left ear and a small tick was located on
the right side of the muzzle. The facility representative did not know what the treatment plan is for ticks and was not
aware of the dog's condition.

Abnormal skin conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort and pain
and could also lead to further health issues. Ticks can transmit disease that can be detrimental to the health of the dog.

Female Cavalier spaniel (tag #444) has an abnormal condition of the skin and eyes. On both sides of the dog along the
top of the rib cage and back towards the hips are large hairless lesions. The lesions appear dark red in the center and
lighter red around their edges. A small amount of dark brown scab-like material is located on the surface of the lesions.
A hairless lesion is also on the surface of the right ear. The lesion is dark red in the center and lighter red along the
edges. A section of dark brown scab-like material is located in the center of the lesion. Another lesion was found on top
of the dog's head. The lesion is hairless, slightly reddened with scab-like material on the surface. Hair was seen in the
dog's mouth attached to the upper right cheek teeth along the gum line. When the hair was removed it revealed fresh
blood along the gum line. A greyish-white discharge is located on the lower eyelid of the left eye. Heavily matted hair is
located on the backside of the dog's hindlegs and contains a large clump of dark brown fecal material. The facility
representative is not aware of the condition of the dog.

Abnormal skin and eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Matted hair could also cause discomfort
and pain and could also lead to further health issues.


Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care to the dogs at all times. The facility representative
had the dogs transported to a veterinarian at the time of the inspection.

Female Shiba Inu (tag #360) has excessively long toenails on all four feet. The toenails splayed out sideways when the
dog was standing on the flooring of the enclosure. The licensee and facility representative were unaware of the last time
the dog had her nails trimmed and were not aware that the toenails were overgrown. Excessively long toenails could
cause pain and discomfort as well as affect the dog's natural gait.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This dog must
have her toenails trimmed to an appropriate length and the licensee must ensure the plan to maintain properly trimmed
toenails is effective.

On June 2, 2021 the licensee had a prescription of Cephalexin and Rimadyl filled by the attending veterinarian for a dog
named "Misty". Instructions for the Cephalexin were to give 1 pill twice daily for 14 days with 28 pills prescribed. On the
day of the inspection, 23 Cephalexin pills were still remaining in the bottle. Instruction for the Rimadyl were to give 1 pill
twice daily for 14 days with 14 pills prescribed. On the day of the inspection, 14 pills Rimadyl pills were still remaining in
the bottle. Failure to follow treatment plans and give medications as prescribed could interfere with the dog's ability to
recover from medical concerns and could lead to further health complications.


Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must fully and completely follow all treatment plans, including the giving of medications, at all times in order to ensure the
dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

The vaccines for the dogs are inappropriately stored. The temperature of the refrigerator containing the vaccines is 54
degrees F per the inspector's Kestrel. The following vaccines were found inside the refrigerator:
Numerous containers of NeoPar Parvo virus vaccine which are to be stored between 35 to 45 degrees F.
Numerous containers of Zoetis Canine Distemper-Adenovirus Type 2-Parainfluenza-Parvovirus which are to be stored
between 35 to 45 degrees F.
Numerous containers of NeoVac Canine Distemper-Adenovirus Type 2 which are to be stored between 35 to 45 degrees
F.
Numerous containers of Nobivac Canine Distemper-Adenovirus Type 2-Parainfluenza-Parvovirus which are to be stored
between 35 to 46 degrees F.
Numerous containers of Nobivac Canine Distemper-Parvovirus which are to be stored between 35-45 degrees F.
Two containers of Nobivac Rabies vaccine which is to be stored between 35-46 degrees F.

Failure to store vaccines at appropriate temperatures may interfere with their effectiveness resulting in an increased risk
of disease.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must store all vaccines at the required temperatures to ensure that all dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Time and method of identification.
Five adult large breed dogs do not have an official form of identification. The facility representative stated that he has the
metal tags and collars for the dogs, but has not yet placed them around the dogs' necks. The facility representative also
stated that the dogs have an ear tattoo, but when the inspectors looked at the tattoo it had faded and was no longer
legible. Failure to have official identification applied to each dog does not allow the inspectors to identify the dog and
could interfere in the ability to connect medical records and other documentation to the dog.

A class "A" dealer can identify all live dogs using the following methods: An official tag affixed to a collar around the dog's
neck, a microchip, or by a legible tattoo marking approved by the Administrator. The licensee must place collars with the
official metal tags around the necks of the five dogs and ensure that all dogs have proper identification at all times.

Time and method of identification.
Cage cards are used as identification for every puppy. Throughout the facility numerous litters of weaned puppies are co-
mingled and in numerous unweaned litters contained foster puppies whith no relation to the female raising them.

One female Pomsky has a litter containing six puppies from three different dams. The DOB on the cage card is for her
puppy, but no DOB is documented on the cage card for the other puppies though it was thought by the facility
representative that the dates of birth for all the puppies were within 2 days of each other. There is also no identification
information for the female Pomsky on the cage card and no identifying information of the original dams and which puppy
belongs to which dam.


The information provided by the cage cards did not allow the inspectors to determine which puppies belonged to the adult
female residing in the enclosure and which additional adult females were dams to the other puppies. An incomplete cage
card does not meet the requirements for identification.

A class "A" dealer must identify all dogs under 16 weeks old by the use of an official tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo, or
a plastic-type collar containing the required information. APHIS Officials also accept microchips or written identification
attached to the enclosure (cage cards) for puppies under 16 weeks old provided that these puppies are maintained in
distinct litters and provided that the cage card contains all of the required information. The consistent movement of
puppies from one mother to another does not constitute maintenance of puppies in distinct litters and failure to individually
identify puppies prevents APHIS Officials from tracking animals movement either in the facility or following sale.

The licensee must ensure that each animal's identity is known with certainty by appropriate individual identification or by
maintaining puppies less than 16 weeks old in distinct groups that are not co-mingled and using appropriate cage cards
with all required information.

On June 14, 2021, the licensee gave ownership of approximately 150 dogs to another individual. No disposition forms for
these dogs were provided to the inspector.


Failure to provide disposition information does not allow APHIS officials to trace animals to premises where they have
resided or are currently located and can interfere with the ability to properly identify dogs.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose all required information
concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or
her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of. The records shall include any offspring
born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The licensee must make, keep and maintain

rewritten copy of APHIS form 7005 is incomplete and the inspector was unable to acquire the missing information as the
original forms are no longer available. Failure to maintain the acquisition information for the required amount of time

could interfere with APHIS official’s ability to properly identify and trace animals.

No dealer, exhibitor, broker, operator of an auction, carrier, or intermediate handler shall, for a period of 1 year, destroy or
dispose of, without the consent in writing of the Administration, any books, records, documents, or other papers required
to be kept and maintained. The licensee must maintain all acquisition information for all adult dogs and puppies. The
licensee must ensure that all required documents are kept for at least one year after the final disposition of the animal.

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The Program of Veterinary Care could not be located for review by the inspectors. During the inspection, one dog was
identified which had ticks attached to her ear and face. The facility representative did not know the plan for treating or
preventing ticks and the plan could not be reviewed due to the missing Program of Veterinary Care. Multiple dogs were
identified with heavily matted hair coats and one dog was identified with severely overgrown toenails, but the plans to
maintain healthy and unmatted hair coats and properly trimmed toenails are located in the Program of Veterinary Care, so
could not be reviewed. Failure to provide the Program of Veterinary Care to the inspectors for review does not ensure the
dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care which could have a negative impact on their health and well-being.

The Exercise Plan for Dogs could not be located for review by the inspectors. Failure to provide the written exercise plan
for review does not allow the inspectors to ensure the dogs are receiving the appropriate exercise which could cause their
health and well-being to suffer.

Each dealer shall allow APHIS officials to examine records required to be kept by the Act and the regulations. The
licensee must provide the Program of Veterinary Care and the Exercise Plan for Dogs for review during the inspection in

order to allow the inspectors to determine the animals are receiving the required exercise and veterinary care.

Handling of animals.
Female Shih tzu (tag #479) is showing signs of severe heat distress. The dog was found inside a shelter located in an
outdoor enclosure. The inspector could hear a rasping sound coming from the shelter as she approached it. Upon
opening the shelter door the inspector observed the dog lying on the floor of the shelter creating a loud raspy sound as
she appeared to gasp for breath. The dog is performing wide open mouth breathing with an extremely high respiration
rate and her tongue is extending out of her mouth beyond the teeth. The dog had recently been shaved and her skin
appeared to have a reddened tint. The dog moved about the shelter, but appeared unstable and continuously laid
sprawled on the floor with her legs stretched out. To exit the shelter, the dog is required to step over a lip at the shelter
entrance and the inspectors observed her having difficulty getting over the lip and finally succeeded in exiting the shelter
by dragging her hind legs across it. The dog continued to appear unstable and had difficulty keeping her hind legs from
collapsing. The facility representative stated the dog had never had problems with her hind legs.

The dog was moved to an enclosure inside the Whelping Building next to an open door with a breeze. The dog still
appeared unstable and had some difficulty moving around the enclosure and needed slight assistance from the facility
representative to locate the water receptacle, whereupon, she immediately began to drink. The dog drank water multiple
times as the inspectors watched. The dog continued to have an extremely high respiration rate along with open mouth
breathing and lying sprawled on the enclosure floor.


The inspectors observed the dog again approximately an hour after she had been moved to the Whelping Building, and
she still appeared slightly weak and unstable.

The facility representative stated that the dog is normally housed inside the sheltered housing building, but had been
moved to the outdoor enclosure that morning. The temperature directly inside the shelter door was between 91 degrees
F and 93 degrees F with a heat index between 107 degrees F and 109 degrees F according to the inspector's Kestrel.

Housing dogs in temperatures and humidity that are inappropriate could result in the discomfort, suffering, and even
death.

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age,
species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are housed in climatic
conditions that are appropriate to maintain their comfort and well-being at all times.

To be corrected by: At the time of the inspection the facility representative moved the dog to a more appropriate location
and then transported her to a veterinarian.
3.1(a) Critical Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
At least three of the outdoor enclosures, containing approximately 25 dogs, have areas along the fence line where the
dogs have dug underneath including at least one freshly dug hole. Many of these gaps have been covered or filled using

boards, wire, or concrete blocks. The decaying carcass of a dead dog was found outside one these enclosures. The
facility representative explained that the dog, a mini Australian Shepherd, had crawled under the fence through one of the
gaps between two adjacent enclosures, and when it entered the adjacent enclosure, it was attacked and killed by the
dogs housed there.

Within the sheltered housing building there is one enclosure, containing an adult female dog and her seven puppies, that
has an opening cut in the fencing that will accommodate a self-feeder. The opening is located along the floor and did not
contain a self-feeder at the time of the inspection. The opening is large enough to allow a puppy to escape from the
enclosure.

A section of the metal fencing between two enclosures, containing a total of two adult dogs and three puppies, in the
covered outdoor enclosures is not secured and is easily moved. One of the adjacent gates is secured with wire, but the
resulting gap is large enough that the dogs could put their head or leg through.

Thirteen enclosures in the whelping building, housing approximately 8 adult female dogs and 97 puppies, have carabiner
style clips to secure entrance to the enclosure. These clips do not secure the entrance tightly and leave a gap large
enough for the puppies to put their heads and legs through.

Carpet squares used as bedding in three enclosures containing 3 adult dogs and approximately 15 unweaned puppies,
have long strands of the material that have pulled away and pose a choking threat to puppies.

The storage closet in the sheltered facility has a leaking water pipe. There is a large amount of water-soaked bedding

material on the floor that has been used to try to adsorb some of the standing water. APHIS officials identified this issue
during an earlier visit to the facility, but the facility representative stated he had not had time to fix the water pipe.

Facilities that are not structurally sound, in good repair, or properly maintained pose a risk to the animals they are to
house and protect. When the enclosure fails to contain the animals, this can result in injury, inability to access food and
water, and in the case described above, death.

Facilities, enclosures, and their contents must be good repair. Housing facilities for dogs must protect the animals from
injuries and contain the animals securely. The licensee must alter the enclosures in a manner that removes the openings
and gaps and eliminates the ability of the animals to escape. The licensee must also repair the leaking water pipe.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the animals and contain them securely at all times.
3.1(b)

Housing facilities, general.
There is an approximately 3’ x 6’ closet located in the sheltered building were the dams and unweaned puppies are
housed. The closet is full of a variety of whelping beds, boxes, bags, buckets, pales, screens, and other unused items to
the point you cannot enter the closet much further than the doorway. The closet also has a leaking water pipe near the
door with large pile of soaked wood shaving bedding material that has been put down to absorb some of the water.

Housing areas must be free of areas that are cluttered or inaccessible and where pests and other vermin could take up
residence. Inaccessible areas cannot be cleaned or evaluated for structural problems. This is particularly troublesome
when there is a visible problem like a water leak that could be causing further problems in adjacent areas that cannot be
evaluated due to the clutter.


Housing facilities must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste material, junk, and other discarded materials and be
kept neat and free of clutter. The licensee must remove the cluttered items from the closet and ensure the housing
facilities remain free of clutter and unused materials at all times.

Numerous sharp points are located throughout the facility.

Inside the sheltered building there is one enclosure, containing one adult dog and four puppies, which has the metal
feeder attached to the front gate by a piece of wire. The sharp ends of the wire are protruding into the enclosure and
could come into direct contact with the dog every time it approaches the feeder to access the food.

In one covered outdoor enclosure, containing four dogs, the shelter has no door, but the metal door frame is still attached
to the entrance. The door frame is broken creating a sharp point at the level of the dogs. In another covered outdoor
enclosure, containing five dogs, the shelter has at least five screws protruding from the entrance which the dogs could
come in contact with.

In one outdoor enclosure, containing eight dogs, there is a long strand of loose wire lying on the ground along with a
broken metal fence post. One dog was seen running through the loose wire.


In another outdoor enclosure, containing eight dogs, the sharp ends of screws are protruding into the shelter along the
door frame and located at the level of the dogs. Broken chain link is located along the bottom of the enclosure fencing
creating sharp points.

More broken chain link is located in an outdoor enclosure containing ten dogs. The sharp points are located at the bottom
of the fencing around the self feeder.

In the corner of an outdoor enclosure, containing nine dogs, there is a broken piece of chain link creating a sharp point at
the level of the animals.

In another outdoor enclosure, containing twelve large breed dogs, numerous sharp points due to broken wires are located
along the bottom of the fencing. The sharp ends of metal screws are protruding into the shelter through the hinges used
to attach the door to the shelter. These sharp screws are located at the level of the dogs.

Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.

Housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges. The licensee must alter the sharp points in a manner
that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all
times.
3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.

Approximately 7 covered outdoor enclosures, containing approximately 25 adult dogs, have plastic buckets for water that
are chewed around the top edges to the point where they can no longer be properly cleaned or sanitized.

In one outdoor enclosure, containing approximately 12 dogs, the top edges of the water buckets have a thick buildup of
hair and dirt.

Routine cleaning and sanitizing of food and water receptacles and other surfaces is important to keep contamination with
dirt and debris that could contain fecal material or other disease-causing bacteria, viruses, or parasites to a minimum.
Chewed plastic receptacles contain rough edges, small dents and pockets that cannot be adequately cleaned and may
continue to harbor these disease-causing agents.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. The licensee must repair, replace, or alter the damaged and dirty
water buckets in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure all surfaces
are maintained in good repair at all times.

In the sheltered building containing the adult females and their unweaned puppies, there is an open bag of dog food that
is not in a container with a lid. Flies were seen on the exterior of the bag and on the dog food inside the bag. The
building has an abnormally large number of flies and employees are using fly spray to try to control them.


Open supplies of food must be in leak-proof containers with lids to protect the food from pests, spoilage, and
contamination from chemicals and other substances that could damage the food or be toxic or harmful to the animals.

The licensee must ensure that all open supplies of food must be kept in leakproof containers with tight fitting lids.

To be corrected by: The facility representative placed the bag of food into a leak-proof container with lid at time of
inspection.

The drains for the sheltered housing building and the covered outdoor runs transports waste directly outside the building's
exterior walls. The drain on the northwest corner has created a large, thick pile of wet fecal and food waste, hair, and
straw. The wet pile has built-up against the lower portion of the exterior wall and has attracted a large number of flies.
APHIS officials had identified the problem on an earlier visit, but the facility has not taken any corrective measures.

The drain on the southwest corner of the sheltered building dumps into PVC pipes that lay on top of the ground and
transports the waste down a hill and away from the building. The PVC pipes run parallel to one outdoor enclosure that
contains eight adult dogs. A stream of liquid waste containing material that is dark green and black is flowing through a
section of the outdoor enclosure. Wet, mossy material is located between the drain pipe and the fence of the enclosure.
The drain pipe could not be checked for damage as the vegetation is overgrown and has hidden most of the pipe.

Drains and drainage areas that are not properly maintained could result in a buildup of waste that could attract pests,
create odors, soil animals, and increase the risk of disease hazards.


Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All
drains must be properly constructed, installed, and maintained. The licensee must alter the drains in a manner that
moves the pile of waste away from the exterior of the building and eliminates the stream of waste flowing through the dog
enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all drains are working properly at all times.

During the inspection, the inspectors identified a decomposing dog that had been killed in a fight. The dog's body was
placed outside of the enclosure, but just a few feet away from the fence. Decomposing animals could attract pests such
as flies, create odors and increase the risk of disease.

Housing facility operators must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food
wastes, bedding, debris, garbage, water, other fluids and wastes, and dead animals, in a manner that minimizes
contamination and disease risks. The licensee must remove the dead dog and ensure that all waste, including dead
animals, are removed from the areas housing dogs as quickly as possible.

In the Whelping Building the trash can is missing the lid and a large pile of empty sacks is placed in a corner. Exposed
trash could attract pests such as flies and mice which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leakproof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times. The facility representative replaced the lid to the trash can at the time of the
inspection, but the license must ensure that all trash is collected as quickly as possible and placed in leak-proof
containers bearing tightly fitted lids.

3.3(e)(1)(iii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
An enclosure in the sheltered housing building, containing a female Wheaton Terrier and her 6 unweaned puppies, has a
section of the wall where the construction of the enclosure is unfinished. The area is in the back wall. The walls of the
rest of enclosure are covered with tile, except this approximately 18” by 24’’ area where it looks like a door to the outside
was planned. The unfinished area has exposed 2’ x 4” wood framing and pieces of fiberglass insulation.

Surfaces of enclosures that have potential contact with dogs must be cleanable and sanitizable in order to prevent the
buildup of debris and other materials that can harbor contaminated and potentially disease-causing agents. These
surfaces must be impervious to water to allow repeated and ongoing cleaning without the deterioration of the surface.
All walls and other surfaces in contact with animals must be impervious to moisture.

Six of the covered outdoor enclosures, housing a total of approximately 26 dogs, have shelters that are too small to
contain the number and size of dogs in the enclosure compliantly.

Failure to provide shelters large enough to accommodate all the animals does not ensure the dogs have the ability to
escape weather extremes which could have a negative impact on their health and well-being.

Dogs must be provided with adequate shelter at all times and those structures must be large enough to allow each animal
to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner and to turn about frequently. The licensee must provide the affected enclosures

with additional shelters or shelters that are large enough to compliantly contain all the dogs at the same time. The
licensee must ensure that all shelters are compliant at all times.

Outdoor housing facilities.
The framing on the largest shelter in the outdoor enclosure containing 8 Golden Retrievers is made of wood. According to
the facility representative, the wood is not water resistant or sealed against moisture.

A 12 to 16 foot long, approximately 10 inch wide board has been attached to the bottom of the wire fence to build a barrier
between two outdoor enclosures. The board was placed there to prevent the dogs from digging more holes under the
fence and entering the adjacent enclosure through those holes. Approximately 10 dogs have direct contact with the board
and the facility representative says the board is not water resistant or sealed against moisture.


One outdoor enclosure, containing approximately 12 dogs, has a metal access door inserted into painted plywood at the
entrance to the shelter. The plywood has been chewed and damaged resulting in a hole in the plywood and unsealed
wood around the access door.

Surfaces of enclosures that have potential contact with dogs must be cleanable and sanitizable in order to prevent the
buildup of debris and other materials that can harbor contaminated and potentially disease-causing agents. These
surfaces must be impervious to water to allow repeated and ongoing cleaning without the deterioration of the surface.
The licensee must ensure that building surfaces in contact with animals in outdoor facilities are impervious to moisture.
Surfaces made of wood that is not pretreated to be impervious to moisture must be sealed.

Primary enclosures.
The whelping building has 57 enclosures that each include a whelping box in the back half of the enclosure and slatted
flooring enclosed by wire fencing in the front half. The floor slats are approximately 3 to 4 inches wide, but the gaps
between them are wide enough that the legs of puppies will easily and frequently fall through them. The inspectors
observed puppies in numerous enclosures and witnessed the legs of one or more of the puppies fall through the
openings.

During the inspection an adult Shih tzu was moved into the building and the inspectors observed her legs fall through the
gaps in the flooring.

APHIS officials had identified this issue to the licensee and facility representative at earlier visits to the facility, but no
action has been taken to correct the problem.

To prevent injuries to legs and feet, puppies need a safe stable surface to move and learn to walk on. To protect them
from injury, all dogs require a safe floor surfaces that will not allow their legs to pass through.

Primary enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that does not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any
openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the floors in a manner that will not allow the feet of the dogs to pass
through. The licensee must ensure that all flooring is safe for the dogs at all times.

Primary enclosures.
In the sheltered building, one enclosure contains 3 adult dogs and a 10-week-old puppy.
Young puppies under 16 weeks old are not well socialized or accustomed to the dynamics of competing for food or water
with other dogs and my not be able to fend for themselves against aggressive or dominant adult dogs.

Puppies under 16 weeks (4 months) of age may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs, other than
the dam or foster. The licensee must house the puppy in a separate enclosure from the adults. The licensee must
ensure that all dogs housed together are compatible at all times.

3.9(b)

Feeding
Metal self-feeders are provided to the dogs housed in the covered outdoor enclosures. In at least two enclosures,
containing a total of five adult dogs, the dog food in the feeders has become coated in a greenish-white substance that
appears to be mold. The moldy food is located underneath the fresh food and is caked together. Food contaminated by
mold could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs should they consume it.

Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration, and caking of feed. The licensee must remove
the moldy food from the metal feeders and ensure that all food provided to the dogs is free of mold and other

contaminates in order to support the health of the dogs.

To be corrected by: The facility representative was verbally instructed to remove all moldy food from the feeders by 5pm
on July 9, 2021.
3.10(a)

Watering
An enclosure in the sheltered housing building containing an adult female Shar-pei and 7 unweaned puppies has an
empty water bowl and no other source of potable water. The facility representative explained that the bowl had been filled
earlier this morning and must have been spilled.

One enclosure in the large Whelping Building, containing one adult dog and six puppies, has an empty water bowl and no
additional source of potable water.

An outdoor enclosure containing approximately ten adult dogs has one water bowl that is nearly empty and the remaining
water is a mud brown color with a buildup up of brown sediment and debris inside it from the dogs entering the bowl water
with their dirty paws. One dog was observed sitting in the water bowl. The outdoor temperature was in the low 90s.

For their overall health and wellbeing, dogs need to have potable water available at all times. This is even more important
during times of extreme heat and requires frequent monitoring by facility staff.

The licensee must ensure that potable water is continuously available to all dogs.


To be corrected by: From this day forward all dogs must have potable water available at all times.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Approximately seven feeders, located in various enclosures through the facility and affecting approximately 20 dogs, have
a brownish buildup of material on the bottom-front edge of the feeder that looks like a combination of powered feed and
dirt.

In the whelping building, two enclosures with 2 dams and approximately 12 unweaned puppies, have a dry brownish
material smeared on some of the vertical surfaces of the whelping boxes which appears to be caused by the dogs
jumping up and putting dirty, feces covered paws against the walls. One enclosure had a similar brownish crusty material
on the livestock panel across the front of the enclosure and hair was trapped in the crusty material.

Two of the outdoor enclosures, containing approximately 15 dogs, have shelters that contained dried and fresh fecal
material on the floors and a dry brownish material smeared on the some of the vertical surfaces of walls.

The buildup of dirt and fecal contaminated material in enclosures and shelters exposes dogs to bacteria and contaminants
that are disease hazards. This is particularly hazardous when the soiled surfaces are in food and water receptacles.

Primary enclosures, including the shelters within them, and food and water receptacles, must be sanitized at least once
every two weeks and more often if necessary, to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, fecal material, or
other disease hazards. The licensee must sanitize all the affected surfaces and ensure all surfaces remain free of a

buildup of dirt, grime, waste and hair at all times.

3.11(b)(4)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
At least four outdoor shelters, accessed by a total of approximately 32 dogs, contain straw bedding material. The majority
of the straw bedding is dark in color and compacted together in a solid pile and the inspector had to pull the layers of
straw apart. The layers of straw were wet, dirty, moldy and had a strong odor of mold. In one of the shelters, accessed
by eight dogs, the contaminated straw was peeled up to reveal a colony of ant-like insects beneath it and in another
affected shelter, accessed by nine dogs, flying gnat-like insects came out of the contaminated straw. The facility
representative was unaware of the contaminated condition of the straw bedding.

In the large Whelping building, the whelping boxes contain wood shavings as absorbent material. In two whelping boxes,
accessed by a total of fifteen puppies, the shavings were completely saturated with urine and feces with no clean,
absorbent areas left. The puppies were observed running around in the wet, dirty shavings. The facility representative
stated that the shavings are only cleaned out of the boxes and replaced once a day.

Bedding material contaminated by waste, mold, dirt and insects may cause the animals to become wet and soiled as well
as raise the risk of disease hazards.

Pens, runs, and outdoor housing areas using material that cannot be sanitized using the methods provided in the
regulations, such as gravel, sand, grass, earth, or absorbent bedding, must be sanitized by removing the contaminated

material as necessary to prevent odors, diseases, pests, insects, and vermin infestation. The licensee must ensure that
all contaminated bedding material is removed from the shelters and whelping boxes as often as necessary to prevent
soiling of the animals, as well as eliminate odors, insects and disease hazards.

3.11(c) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There is a buildup of dirt, dust and cobwebs along the back wall of the covered outdoor enclosures and on the retaining
walls and ledges of the exterior wall. The buildup of dust, dirt and cobwebs can increase the risk of disease hazards
towards the dogs.

Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept clean. The
licensee must remove the buildup of dirt, dust, and cobwebs from the walls and ledges of the covered outdoor enclosures
and ensure the building and surrounding areas remain clean.

The vegetation around the sheltered building is excessively overgrown. The vegetation is growing up against the exterior
walls and it is interfering in the ability of waste to flow from the drains and away from the building. The vegetation is also
covering the building's drainage pipe which lies on top of the ground and it cannot be determined if the pipe is damaged
and leaking as the pipe cannot be visualized. Overgrown vegetation can attract pests such as flies and mice, as well as
make it difficult to view areas of the facility for damage and interfere with cleaning processes.

Weeds, grasses, and bushes must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to

protect the health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must take measures to control the overgrown vegetation in
order to promote facility cleanliness and maintenance procedures.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
An excessively large number of flies and insects are located throughout the facility. The interiors of the sheltered building
and whelping building, containing approximately 71 adult dogs and 370 puppies, are kept cool by leaving the doors open.
The doors have no screens and flies and other insects are free to enter the buildings. Flies were seen on the walls of the
buildings and enclosures, in the water bowls, in the food bowls and on the dog food, on the floors of the enclosures, and
on the dogs themselves. In the outdoor enclosures flies were inside some of the shelters, accessed by a total of 17 dogs,
along with gnat-like insects and ant-like insects that had infested the straw bedding. The facility representative stated
that they spray for flies inside the buildings. Excessive numbers of flies and other insects can contaminate food and water
as well as cause health hazards towards the dogs.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs and cats, and birds and mammals that
are pests, must be established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective plan to control flies and other
insects in order to support the health of the dogs. The licensee must ensure the plan is effective at all times.
3.13(b)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Female Boston terrier (#270) had a c-section and was then returned to the veterinarian at a later date for additional
treatment. The licensee was able to present an itemized bill from the attending veterinarian showing all the procedures

done for the dog. The documents did not contain the dog's identity, breed, sex, age, or tag number. Failure to provide
information concerning the identity of the animal on medical records does not allow APHIS officials to determine which
dog the medical record belongs to and interferes in the inspector's ability to determine if the animal has received adequate
veterinary care.

Each dealer shall make and keep medical records for dogs that include the identity of the animal, including identifying
marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s breed, sex, and age. The licensee must ensure that all medical
records contain the identification of the dog in order to allow APHIS officials to determine if a specific dog has received
adequate veterinary care.

To be corrected by: From this day forward all medical records must contain the dog's identification.
3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
During a prior visit conducted by APHIS officials, nine dogs were identified that required veterinary care. At the time of
the current inspection, the inspectors requested the written medical records for these dogs, but the facility has no written
medical records concerning the examination, diagnosis and treatment plans for these animals. Failure to maintain
medical records does not allow APHIS officials to ensure the animals have received adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall maintain medical records that include the problem identified, the date and description of the problem,
examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed. The licensee must
document in writing all required information for any dog with a medical concern in order for the inspectors to determine the
animal has received adequate veterinary care.

3.15(a)(9)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
The facility has five adult dogs contained in three transport enclosures waiting to be taken to another location. There is no
absorbent litter in any of the three transport enclosures and feces and spilled dog food are located on the floor of one of
these enclosures. The inspectors first observed these dogs at approximately 9am and the facility representative stated
the dogs had been in the transport enclosures since 7am. The inspectors left the facility at approximately 3pm and two
dogs still remained in transport enclosures with no absorbent litter and feces and spilled dog food are located on the floor
of one of the enclosures. Failure to provide clean, absorbent litter may cause the dogs to become contaminated by waste
material.

Primary enclosures used to transport dogs must contain enough unused litter to absorb and cover excreta. The litter must
be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic to the dogs. The licensee must add absorbent litter to all
enclosures used to transport dogs in order to ensure the dogs remain clean and dry.

To be corrected by: From this day forward absorbent litter must be used when transporting dogs.
3.15(e)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Five adult dogs are contained in three transport crates waiting to be moved to another location. Two plastic crates each
contain two dogs and the amount of space is insufficient to allow the dogs to turn around and lie in normal positions. The
inspectors observed one dog turning around in an abnormal position due to the lack of space. The dog was required to
lower his hind end towards the floor in order to bend his front end around to complete the turn in the tight quarters.
Failure to provide adequate space during transport may have a negative impact on the animal's health and well-being.


Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats must be large enough to ensure that each animal contained in
the primary enclosure has enough space to turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a
natural position. The licensee must ensure that transport enclosures provide the required amount of space for each dog
in order to support their health and well-being.

To be corrected by: The facility representative returned the dogs to their primary housing enclosures or separated the
dogs into compliant transport enclosures at the time of the inspection.
3.19(e)(1)

Terminal facilities.
Five dogs are contained in transport enclosures waiting to be moved to another location. The enclosures are sitting in
front of the kennel along the driveway and are provided with no shade to protect them from direct sunlight. Two of the
transport enclosures are constructed of plastic with a solid top, but one of the transport enclosures is a wire crate with no
solid top. The inspectors requested the facility representative to provide the dogs with shade which was done. Failure to
provide protection from the direct rays of the sun could cause the dogs to become overheated which could have a
detrimental impact on their health and well-being.

Shade must be provided that is sufficient to protect the dog from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must ensure that
all dogs housed in transport enclosures have sufficient shade as protection from the direct rays of the sun in order to
support their health and well-being.

To be corrected by: The facility representative provided shade to the dogs at the time of the inspection.


This inspection was conducted with the licensee and/or the facility representative. The exit interview were conducted with
the facility representative.
