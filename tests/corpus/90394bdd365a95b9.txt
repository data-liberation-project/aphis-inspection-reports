Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Three dogs had medical issues that had not been observed by facility staff or communicated to the Attending Veterinarian
(AV).
***A 10-year-old yellow Labrador dog (“Showboat”, microchip #900215003196826) has an approximately 1-inch diameter
raised round soft lump on the right hind foot, located midway between the toes and the ankle (hock) joint. The lump is pink
and there is some hair loss on the surface. The kennel manager stated that she had observed this lump and had cleaned
and treated it with topical antibiotic, but had not contacted the Attending Veterinarian.
***A 9-year-old female yellow Labrador dog (“Sunny”, microchip #965000005267139) has two lumps on her feet. On the
right front foot, on the second to inner most toe, there is a ½ inch diameter, round, hairless, pink and black swelling. On
the left hind foot, on the inner most toe, there is a ½ inch diameter, round, hairless, pink and black swelling. The kennel
manager stated that they had seen these two lumps before but had not notified the attending veterinarian.
***A 5-year-old male yellow Labrador dog (“Burger”, microchip # 900215003196988) has an approximately ½ inch
diameter raised round pink hairless mass on the left front foot, located near the base of the inner toes. This had not been
previously observed by the kennel manger.
Daily observation of animals for health or behavior problems is essential for the prompt identification and treatment of


these issues. Animals who have problems that are not promptly identified by the facility and conveyed to the attending
veterinarian may suffer from discomfort, pain, disease progression, and even death.
Correct by ensuring that daily observations are conducted on all animals, that abnormalities are reported to the Attending
Veterinarian promptly.

Veterinary care for dogs.
Multiple dogs had medical issues that had been identified by facility personnel but had not been recorded in the animal’s
medical records.
***A 7-year-old female Weimaraner (“Pearl” microchip #956000004032360) has an approximately 1.5-inch diameter firm
round mass under the last two nipples on the right side of her abdomen, located near the inner right thigh. The kennel
manager stated that she had observed this mass recently and had told the AV about it, but this health issue was not
documented in the dog’s medical records.
***An 11-year-old female Vizsla (“Shakira”, microchip #985112005668912) has an approximately 1.5 inch diameter soft
round lump on the right hind limb in the thigh area on the outside of the leg. The kennel manager stated that she had
observed this lump before and had contacted the AV about it, but there is no documentation of this observation or any
communication with the AV in the medical record.
***A 9-year-old female yellow Labrador dog (“Sunny”, microchip #965000005267139) has two lumps on her feet. On the
right front foot, on the second to inner most toe, there is a 0.5 inch diameter, round, hairless, pink and black swelling. On
the left hind foot, on the inner most toe, there is a 0.5 inch diameter, round, hairless, pink and black swelling. The kennel
manager stated that they had seen these two lumps before but there is nothing about these lumps documented in the
dog’s medical record.
Complete and accurate medical records are essential for animal health and welfare. These records capture information


about health problems found, instructions from the attending veterinarian, treatment plans, and test results. Records allow
for continuity of care when staffing or routines change , and eliminates confusion about an animal’s past or current
medical issues.
Correct by 10/14/22 by ensuring that medical records include all required elements under the Animal Welfare Act,
including documentation of problems identified, treatment plans, and treatments administered.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The medical records for numerous dogs did not include information about treatments administered or dates of
administration:
***Medical records show that a 10-year-old neutered male Vizsla (“Pongo”, microchip #985112005668866) was examined
by the Attending Veterinarian (AV) on 09/30/22 due to weight loss (records show this dog was 41 lbs at time of exam,
body condition score 3/9 recorded by the AV). The dog was prescribed a dewormer (Panacur) for 5 days (along with other
instructions). The kennel manager stated that the Panacur was given to the dog as prescribed for 5 days, but these
treatments are not recorded in the dog’s medical record. The kennel manager stated that they subsequently contacted the
AV and was instructed to give Flagyl (metronidazole) to the dog daily until the stools were firm. These instructions are not
recorded in the dog’s medical record and any doses of metronidazole given to the dog are also not recorded in the
medical record.
***Medical records show that a 5-year-old male yellow Labrador dog (“Burger”, microchip # 900215003196988) was
examined by the AV on 09/30/22 for weight loss (approximately 25% of body weight lost over the preceding 5 months)
and was prescribed a dewormer (Panacur) for 5 days and an antibiotic (Metronidazole) for 10 days. The kennel manager
stated that these medications were given to the dog as prescribed for the required length of time, but these treatments are
not recorded in the dog’s medical record.


***Medical records show that an 11-year-old female Golden Retriever (“Amanda”, microchip #985112004242013) and a
12-year-old male Golden Retriever (“Rio", microchip #956000005266129) were both examined by the AV on 09/30/22 for
ear issues and both were prescribed Zymox, Benadryl, and Fish oils for a treatment. The kennel manager stated that she
had not received these medications yet from the AV, but that she had been cleaning both dogs ears weekly with diluted
vinegar. The AV confirmed that he approved this treatment whilst awaiting the other medications. No record of the vinegar
treatments are recorded in either of the animal’s medical records.
***According to medical records, a female 10-year-old male German Shorthair Pointer dog ("Annie", microchip
#985112003820467) was examined by the AV on 10/04/22 and was prescribed antibiotics (doxycycline) and cough
suppressant (“cough tabs”). The kennel manager stated that these medications were given to the dog as prescribed for
the required length of time, but these treatments are not recorded in the dog’s medical record.
Recording the names and dates of all treatments given is essential for ensuring the provision of adequate medical care for
dogs.
Correct by ensuring that the names and dates of all treatments given are recorded in medical records for animals.

This inspection was conducted with the kennel manager, and the exit interview was conducted with the kennel manager
and facility consultant.
