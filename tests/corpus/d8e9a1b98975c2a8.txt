Contingency planning.
The contingency plan was not available for review at time of inspection and facility employees did not indicate they were
trained on the plan. A plan is important to be in place to be prepared for unexpected disasters or events. A contingency
plan is required to be in place by July 5, 2022 as well as all employees trained on the plan within 60 days of that date. A
plan must be developed and available for USDA review and employee training documented.
