3.84(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The IACUC semiannual inspection report dated July 2016 shows a significant deficiency in the SPF nursery
Comparative Medicine Animal Facility. The IACUC reported that 2 male baboons (1113 and 2813) were paired in a
primary enclosure for at least 6 weeks without the enclosure being sanitized. The facility representative explained
that the animal care staff had not been trained to transfer animals of this age to new caging in order to sanitize the
primary enclosure. Indoor primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and cleaned as often
as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, or disease hazard using one of the
methods prescribed in the Animal Welfare Act.
This was corrected within 24 hours of discovery from the IACUC facility semiannual inspection.
