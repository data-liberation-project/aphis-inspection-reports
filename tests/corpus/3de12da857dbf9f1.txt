Facilities, general.
***The elk's enclosure has a loose panel in the middle and loose panel wire by the watering area. For safety, the facility
reports maintenance has been postponed until next week to be sure the elk is out of rut and has dropped its antlers.
Loose panels and panel strands could injure the elk. Maintain the elk enclosure free from loose panels and loose panel
wires. Ensure that a safe method of correcting these areas is employed and that in the future a safe method of
maintaining the elk's enclosure is in place year-round (options were discussed)

***The middle fence-line in the fallow deer pen is in disrepair and has loose strands in it that the deer could contact.
Loose wire could cause injury. Ensure that animal enclosures are free from loose wire and free from sharp points.
