ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has no written program of veterinary care approved by the attending veterinarian on the premises. A
part-time attending veterinarian is employed by the facility and visits the site monthly. A program of veterinary care
was obtained from the attending veterinarian at the time of the exit, but the staff did not know what was included in
the program of veterinary care at the time of inspection. A written program of veterinary care is necessary to ensure
that the facility staff understands the expectations of the attending veterinarian in regards to the care and use of the
animals. A program of veterinary care must be written, approved by the attending veterinarian as part of the formal
arrangement between the facility and the attending veterinarian, and the facility must have a copy of the program in
order to ensure adherence to the program of veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Numerous goats were observed with nasal discharge and several were observed with diarrhea and areas of hair
loss (described in detail below). The attending veterinarian had not been contacted prior to the inspection regarding
any of these animals. None of the goats with nasal discharge or hair loss were receiving any veterinary treatment at
the time of inspection. Three goats were receiving Nuflor without the knowledge of the veterinarian or being listed in
the Program of Veterinary Care.
**About 12-15 goats were observed with nasal discharge in both pastures. The nasal discharge was slimy in
appearance and mostly white to clear with a few having a greenish color. There was also dry white crusty material
inside and around the nose in some goats. Coughing was occasionally heard. None of these goats were receiving
any treatments and had not been identified by staff.
**Four of the goats were pulled from the main two herds and put inside a sick pen. One of the four goats was pulled
the night before and hadn(cid:25)t been treated with any medication, but the three other goats were receiving Nuflor.
Another goat with ear tag Y-26 located in pasture 2 was identified of having diarrhea. The goat had a large amount
of brown greenish wet material on the tail, around the base of the tail, under the tail, on the upper portion of the
back legs that was consistent with diarrhea. Y-26 was not receiving any treatments and the staff was unaware of thegoat(cid:25)s condition.
**Two goats(R-24 and W-119) had a circular area of hair loss on the upper portion of the bridge of the nose. The
areas of hair loss showed pink skin with white flaky material on the surface of the skin.
**For the months of October, November, and December at total of 18 goats have naturally died. This is roughly a
10% mortality loss for the goat herd over the past 3 months. No necropsies were performed and no diagnostic
testing was conducted to determine the cause of death. Fecal testing was performed on some of the goats before
death that determined there was a parasite infection, but the cause of death was never determined. The owner
reported that some of the goats were older but other goats simply died without showing any signs.
Animals not provided appropriate veterinary care will often not improve and will lead to the worsening of the original
condition along with secondary infections. Medications not approved by the attending veterinarian may have no
impact on the disease or may cause further harm to the animal. Mortality in goats is an important sign a serious
disease is present in a herd. A veterinarian needs to be contacted when there is an unexpected death, so the
disease can be properly diagnosed and the other animals be treated or given a preventive. Because of the recent
high mortality loss, all animal deaths must have a necropsy conducted by a license veterinarian. All animals must be
provided appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in a timely manner and
all treatments must be approved by the veterinarian either by the Program of Veterinarian Care or by direct
communication. At the time of the exit interview the attending veterinarian had treated the animals identified in need
of veterinary care.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On inspection multiple goats, mentioned above, were not provided proper daily observation, and illnesses were not
communicated to a veterinarian. Daily observation is needed to assess an animal(cid:25)s health and well-being. Failure
to daily assess animals and report illnesses to a veterinarian can result in injuries and diseases not being diagnosed
and treated in a timely manner and results in the further progression of the illness or injury. Provide daily
observation for all animals to evaluate their health and well-being, and provide an accurate and timely means of
communication so that all problems for all animals are reported to a veterinarian. Correct this day forward.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were numerous sharp wires pointing inside the goat enclosures. Some examples of sharp wires observed at
the facilities inside the goat enclosures include: small loose wires tying fencing together, metal cattle fencing used
as containment for outdoors was broken in several areas, and multiple wooden posts wrapped in old brokenfencing. The ends of the wires were sharp to the touch. No cuts or injuries were observed on any of the animals.
Sharp points or jagged edges could cause injury and pain to an animal. Loose wires are also more likely to break off
and be eaten or stepped on. All housing facilities must protect the animals from injury. Monitor all wire fences and
enclosures to ensure loose wires are removed and could not harm any animals. Correct by 1/12/2015.
This is a focus inspection of the indirect non-compliances.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and multiple representatives of the facility.
