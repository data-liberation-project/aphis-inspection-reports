3.6(a)(2)(12)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Wire Coating
The licensee has vinyl coated wire flooring in all of the enclosures throughout the building. In all of the
enclosures the vinyl coating has peeled from the wire and bare wire is exposed. The wire has not
yet rusted and is not broken. But the bare patches of flooring were very noticeable and were more than a small,
random amount. The applicant must ensure that all metal strand flooring that is smaller than 9 gauge is coated and
in
good condition and protects the feet and toes of the dogs. All flooring must be constructed and maintained to
protect the legs, feet, and toes of the dogs and to allow them to walk and stand comfortably at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning
There was an excessive accumulation of animal waste, dirt, debris, and hair on the tops of the primary enclosures in
the covered tent structure outside the building. The licensee must ensure that the enclosures are cleaned and
sanitized on a more frequent basis to prevent this build up of dirt and debris. All surfaces of housing facilities must
be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
Sanitization may be done using any of the methods provided in Sec. 3.11(b)(3) for primary enclosures.
