INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
It was discovered in the Spring 2018 IACUC meeting that a class (VT 203) had recently used a cat to demonstrate
an imaging procedure. That class had historically not used animals for teaching, therefore had no animal use
protocol. There was no harm to the animal.
All animal use must be covered by an IACUC-approved protocol.
Corrected prior to inspection: A protocol for the class has since been written and approved to ensure that animal
use is in accordance with the AWA regulations.
2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A set of twin calves born earlier this year died of joint ill. They were born small and weak. The farm manager
initiated care immediately, including tube feeding colostrum. He notified the Attending Veterinarian (AV) the
following day. The calves later developed swollen joints and died despite treatment with antibiotics.
Any health concerns must be reported to the AV in a timely manner.
Correct by ensuring all facility personnel promptly report any health concerns to the AV from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
