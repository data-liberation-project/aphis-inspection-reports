SANITATION.
Two live mice were noted in the hedgehog portion of the facility. Mouse feces was noted on the floor in the
hedgehog portion of the facility. Mice can be vectors for disease and it is essential that the population of live mice
within the facility be minimized. New construction is planned that should eliminate the problem. In the meantime a
more effective means of pest control must be implemented and maintained to minimize the mice at the the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees.
