3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were areas, both in and outside the enclosures, that have not been cleaned and sanitized properly or at
appropriate frequencies.
Specifically:
*In the pink room, in many areas where the bars met the walls/ceilings, there was a build-up of black grimy material
and/or organic waste material.
In the blue enclosure, housing the smaller chimpanzee, there was buildup of black grimy material and/or organic
waste on the wooden portion of the enclosure over the bars where the animals place their hands.
Within the yellow enclosure, there was caked up brown material covering the three metal bars installed in the
ceiling.
* Proper and routine cleaning and sanitizing is necessary to prevent the attraction of pests and disease
transmission.
*** The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact are
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.84 to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease
hazards.
Furthermore, the licensee must ensure all other surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized as often as
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
3.77(b) REPEAT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
* There was a strong ammonia odor upon entering the pink room. The licensee has an HVAC system for that roombut had not turned it on because the owner was concerned that it may make the room too cold for the animals.
** Poor ventilation can could even be harmful to the animals by allowing ammonia levels to get too high thus
causing eye, throat and lung irritation.
*** The licensee must ensure that animal facilities are sufficiently ventilated at all times to provide for the health and
well-being of nonhuman primates and to minimize odors and ammonia levels.
