3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The wire mesh floor of one rabbit enclosure was not attached to one side of the enclosure which allowed the floor to
sag. The wire enclosures of eight other rabbits were observed to have areas along the back side of the enclosures
where wires had corroded, leaving gaps and broken wire tines. Rabbits could become entangled and injured in
enclosure defects while broken wire tines could result in punctures wounds or scratches.
A system should be in place to ensure that enclosures are monitored regularly and replaced or repaired in a timely
manner if they are found to be defective.
