Acquisition and disposition records are required so that animals being used in regulated activities can be accurately
tracked to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation. Animals transferred to or acquired from
other licensees must have disposition and acquisition records containing all information required by the Animal Welfare
Act Regulations available for inspection. This requirement applies to all regulated animals purchased or otherwise
acquired, owned, held, leased or otherwise in possession of or under control of the licensee, and all regulated animals
transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring
born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

Housing facilities, general.
The mangaby enclosure had a dead rat in the enclosure. The rat appeared desiccated indicating it had been there for
several days. Dead animals can carry disease, attract pests, and cause odor.
The Celebes and Squirrel monkey enclosures had an accumulation of old food materials and/or an excessive
accumulation of feces. Feces and old food can attract flies and other pests that can carry disease and physically irritate
the animals.
Enclosures with dirt floors must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid
contact with excreta, or as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
The primate enclosures need to be cleaned more frequently. Cage furniture that is not easily cleaned needs to be
replaced following the veterinarians recommended schedule.

Watering.
The pigs in the enclosure under the giraffe viewing area did not have water when we arrived. They were given water while
we observed. All of the pigs spent a considerable amount of time drinking. They drank until the water bowl was empty.


If water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort
of the animals. The level of thirst the pigs displayed indicates they were not comfortable.
The facility needs to provide the pigs with water more often or devise a system that allows the pigs to have continuous
access to water
Corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
The pig enclosure under the giraffe viewing area had a large accumulation of feces in one corner. Feces can attract flies
and other pests that can carry disease and physically irritate the animals.
The Fossa enclosure had an accumulation of old bones that had been completely cleaned and bleached white indicating
they had been there for a while.
Enclosures with dirt floors must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid
contact with excreta, or as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
The pig and fossa enclosures need to be cleaned more frequently.
