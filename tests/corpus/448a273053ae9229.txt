PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two enclosures were too small for the dogs they contained. One enclosure contained two adults and three
puppies. The dogs measured 15 inches, 13.5 inches, 13.5 inches, 16 inches, and 19 inches respectively. They
required 2,310.5 square inches of space. Their enclosure measured 32 inches by 36 inches and had 1,152 square
inches of space. The dogs in that enclosure were short by 1,158.5 square inches of space.
The second enclosure contained six weaned puppies. Three of the puppies measured 13 inches, two measured
13.5 inches, and one measured 14 inches. The puppies required 2,243.5 square inches of space. The enclosure
measured 32 by 36 inches for a total of 1,152 square inches of space. The dogs in that enclosure were short by
1,091.5 square inches of space.
Cage space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their cages. It
minimizes the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread of disease. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the
minimum floor space requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that enclosure. Correct
immediately.
3.6(c)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A 4 month old male Cava Poo (microchip ID # (900)111880710082) has been tethered to a shed with
indoor/outdoor access for the past three weeks. The licensee stated she ran out of room for him in the main
building so she put him out there temporarily until she could get him sold. Tethering a dog for an extended period of
time can be uncomfortable and stressful for that dog. In addition, it can result in injury to the dog. Tethering of dogs
for use as a primary enclosure must be discontinued. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
