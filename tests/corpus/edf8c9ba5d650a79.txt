SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The temperature outside during the inspection was 91deg F, with a temperature inside the kennel of 93deg F with a
Heat Index of 101deg F. Several of the dogs were coming inside the kennel and panting, unable to cool down in the
temperature controlled area due to insufficient cooling modifications inside the kennel. The temperatures are going
to be in the low 90s for the next week in this area, requiring additional cooling measures to be implemented.
High temperatures inside the kennel can cause heat stress and discomfort to the regulated animals, which could be
a possible health issue if they get over heated and are unable to get into a cooler environment.
The ambient temperature must not rise above 85 [deg]F (29.5 [deg]C) for more than 4 consecutive hours when
dogs are present. There needs to be some method of cooling in the temperature controlled area to prevent the
temperature from rising above 85deg F for extended periods to allow for the animals to cool down from excessively
high temperatures outside.
