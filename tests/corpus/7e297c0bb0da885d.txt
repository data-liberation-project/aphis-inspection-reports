2.131(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A young female sloth "Malia" died on 10/26/19. According to the veterinarian, the animal was reported to have
fallen earlier that day from a climbing structure. Despite intensive care and initial success in reviving the animal, the
sloth become unresponsive and was finally euthanized.
The animal was submitted for necropsy. The ultimate cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to
the head, most likely resulting from the fall. Additional significant findings included severe emaciation, indications of
chronic stress, and older bruising to the body wall that was not associated with the current trauma nor the CPR
used during treatment. The results were found to be consistent with mishandling, neglect and ignorance of animal
care. The licensee's lack of knowledge of the species led to the deteriorating health of the sloth, which may have
contributed to the animal's demise.
All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the
species they maintain.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A visitor to the facility was reported to have been bitten by a capybara. The bite report stated the patient was bitten
on the right arm as she was petting the animal. This bite incident was reported to the local county animal control on
12/4/19 by the medical facility that treated the patient. The licensee stated that they were unaware that a visitor had
been bitten.
The facility does allow the public to interact with the animals without a barrier or restraint. Capybara have sharp
teeth, and can cause injury. During public exhibition, all animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of
injury to the animals and the public. This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
