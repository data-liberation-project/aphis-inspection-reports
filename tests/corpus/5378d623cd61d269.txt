2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The licensee has conducted activities not authorized by a Class-A License. During inspection the licensee pointed out a
groundhog which he stated is used annually for exhibition purposes. He confirmed that the last exhibition took place on
groundhog’s day (2/2/22). Dealers which maintain a Class-A license may only sell animals that are born and raised on
their property. A Class-B or Class-C license is required for exhibition of animals. Licenses are issued to specific persons
for specific activities. A new license must be obtained prior to a change in ownership, location, activities, or animals.
Failure to notify Animal Care at least 90-days prior to a change in activities prevents the licensee from obtaining a new
license prior to conducting those exhibition activities.

Information provided on disposition records from another facility state that two Ring tail lemurs were sold to Kokas Exotics
on April 19, 2021. The licensee states he does not have the animals and were purchased by a facility representative. The
current license does not allow the buying and selling of exotic animals not born on the premises.

Correct by ensuring that a Class-B or Class-C license is obtained before any future exhibition and/or re-sale of animals
not born and bred at the facility.



Correct no later than 9/2/2022.

*One adult male Bobcat was in very poor body condition at the time of inspection. This bobcat was co-housed with
another bobcat that appeared in good body condition. Despite the length of the animal’s hair, the individual vertebrae
were easily visible, the ribs and shoulder were readily apparent, and there was a severe abdominal tuck. The licensee
stated that both Bobcat are fed only every other day and that they had been fed the day prior. He further stated that he
had observed the Bobcat’s poor condition and had dewormed it the day prior with Panacur, but that the attending
veterinarian had not examined the animal. Additionally, while the licensee stated that the Attending Veterinarian had
provided information regarding the dose of Panacur, he was unsure if he was supposed to repeat the dose and/or provide
that dose for multiple days. Poor body condition can indicate a lack of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate
other underlying disease processes. Failure to properly observe and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the
attending veterinarian can lead to worsening of the condition, prolonged unnecessary suffering, and possibly starvation
and death.

*Young skunks, 6-8 weeks old, are having their scent glands removed by the licensee without general anesthesia. The
attending veterinarian has provided instructions for the licensee and an assistant to restrain the animals, “fan” 0.5 ml of
local anesthetic around the gland region, wait approximately three minutes then evert the gland and “pull it free” using
forceps. There is no guidance provided for post-procedural monitoring of these animals. This is a major surgical
procedure which produces permanent impairment of physical and physiological function, as defined by the Animal
Welfare Act Regulations and Standards, with a high risk for complications such as rectal prolapse. Licensee stated he


observes rectal prolapse in many of his adult skunks. He stated sometimes the prolapses resolve on their own, and
sometimes he must push them back in with his finger. With this major surgical procedure being performed on conscious
animals with the ability to move and squirm, the risk for complications is inherently increased. The attending veterinarian
(AV) has stated to a member of this inspection team that he is a mixed animal practitioner (dogs, cats, farm animals) and
is not an exotic veterinarian. Additionally stating the procedure is analogous to anal gland expression in dogs. The AV
stated he has only seen the procedure performed by the Licensee, that the licensee taught him how to preform this
procedure, and that he has not consulted with any other knowledgeable veterinarian experienced in performing the
procedure. The procedure as described by the attending veterinarian and being performed by the licensee is not
adequate veterinary care and can lead to unnecessary pain and distress. Licensee shall establish and maintain a
program of adequate veterinary care that includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat the
animals on hand. Additionally correct by ensuring that there is adequate guidance to personnel involved with handling,
immobilization, anesthesia, and analgesia (in accordance with section 2.40(b)(4). And further that adequate pre-
procedural and post-procedural care in accordance with established medical and nursing procedures in accordance with
section 2.40(b)(5).

Thirty-five animals were identified during the inspection that required veterinary care. These animals were not identified
by the license prior to inspection and/or were identified prior to inspection, but their issues were not communicated to the
attending veterinarian.

- One white colored red fox was identified as being in very poor body condition. This fox co-housed with another white


colored red fox in an enclosure with two green cards with the number “8” on them. The hips, pelvis, ribs and shoulder for
this fox were easily visible. It had poor hair coat and a pronounced abdominal tuck. There was no food or water was
present in the enclosure when first identified by inspectors. When water was provided both fox in the enclosure drank, the
severely underweight fox drank for a prolonged time (approximately 3 minutes) stopping only briefly when interrupted or
when it went to look in the food bowl. When asked the licensee stated that this was “old”, approximately 10 years old, and
that some of the fox (like this one) just drink a lot. He agreed the animal was underweight but had not communicated that
or his observation of increased thirst to the attending veterinarian prior to inspection. Poor body condition can indicate a
lack of sufficient quality or quantity food or may indicate other underlying disease processes. Particularly when combined
with increased thirst, this may indicate underlying medical issues and is important information to communicate to the
attending veterinarian so that the fox may be properly examined, a diagnosis can be made, and a treatment plan can be
prescribed. Failure to properly observe and/or communicate animals in poor condition to the attending veterinarian can
lead to, prolonged unnecessary suffering, worsening of the condition and possibly starvation and death.

- One adult mink present in an enclosure on the left side row within the mink building had patchy hair loss over the
majority of its body. There were numerous scabs of varying sizes, and the underlying skin was red suggesting that the
animal was itchy and likely self-inflicting these wounds. The hair loss was worst around the base of the head and neck
area. The licensee stated that he hadn’t seen hair loss in this mink before, but that occasionally they will scratch due to
fleas. He agreed that he would have the veterinarian look at this animal.

- One Skunk present in the last enclosure on the left side row of the mink / ferret building had severely overgrown
toenails. The nails were thickened and so long that they were curling outwards and twisting the toes into abnormal


positions. This skunk appeared slower than the others and reluctant to walk. When observed trying to groom its face, the
animal appeared to have difficult and stopped quickly again appearing uncomfortable. Excessively long nails can cause
abnormal gaits and may become caught in wire-bottom enclosures causing discomfort to the animals. Prolonged
severely overgrown nails can lead to chronic musculoskeletal abnormalities and may be painful. In addition to this skunk,
at least 15-20 other animals (skunk, artic fox, and red fox) also had overgrown nails that needed to be trimmed for their
health and comfort.

- One adult skunk present in enclosure R2C1 had a white to blue opaque discoloration covering the entire corneal surface
of the right eye. Additionally, this skunk had a similar area on a portion of the surface of the left eye. The licensee stated
that he had not noticed it before but that it was an older female skunk and possibly a cataract. There was no discharge,
however, the opacity was on the surface of the eye rather than within the eye itself (as occurs with cataracts). Ocular
conditions are often painful, and this type of corneal discoloration can occur from many causes including infectious,
traumatic, or inherited.

- Five of the Six alpaca had an excessive amount of coat / fiber present. The two black and one white alpaca had long
matted cords of fiber dangling from their body past their knees. The others had more tightly matted fiber over their trunk
and back. The amount of fiber present precluded visualizing the topline of all but one of these animals. That alpaca was
excessively thin with a very prominent spine. Body condition could not be assessed in the others because of the amount
of fiber present. The licensee stated that he only shears the alpaca in the fall. Excessive fiber in alpaca can lead to
discomfort and overheating in the hot summer months. Additionally, matting or cording of the fiber reduces its ability to
keep water off the alpaca and properly insulate in the cold winter months.



- One brown alpaca had lower incisor teeth that were long enough that they were protruding out above the upper lip. This
animal had enough fur present, that inspectors could not visually assess the alpaca’s weight / body condition. Proper
occlusion of incisors is necessary for grazing.

- One juvenile fallow deer had approximately 10-12 black raised roughly circular rough dark colored wart-like growths on
both sides of its face. These ranged from approximately ½ to 2 cm and were primarily around the eyes and mouth. When
pointed out to the licensee, he stated he thought they were just flies. Skin growths can be caused by a variety of agents
including several which may be contagious to other animals (such as when caused by viruses).

- One standard color raccoon housed alone (and with no offspring present) had hair loss on its rump and entire tail. The
hair that was present was short appearing nearly even with the skin. The licensee stated that this animal was “molting”
and “sometimes they do that”, however, the hair appeared either chewed or broken off. Hair with this type of extremely
short appearance (not due to shearing / shaving) can occur for many reasons and may be self-inflicted such as self-
barbering due to severe psychological distress, breaking hairs from scratching, or hormonal causes. Communication with
the attending veterinarian and the use of appropriate diagnostic testing is necessary to determine the underlying cause
and prevent worsening and unnecessary suffering.

- One grey colored Mink had hair loss on the tip of its tail. And area approximately 1 cm long was nearly hairless. The
licensee stated that he had not observed the hair loss in his animal, but that sometimes Mink pull or chew their fur out.
Hair loss in animals can be caused by several problems such as nutritional deficiencies or traumatic injury. When self-


induced, hair loss can indicate behavioral stress, neurological dysfunction, or other problems.
Failure to adequately observe animals daily and/or failure to communicate issues of abnormal health and behavior to the
attending veterinarian (AV) in a timely manner, prevents the provision of adequate veterinary care and can lead to
worsening of the condition for individuals and/or failure to prevent disease in other animals. Correct by ensuring that the
animals and conditions listed above are reported to the attending veterinarian so that the animal can be properly
examined, diagnosed, and treated. Additionally, ensure that animal’s daily observation of animals is adequate to identify
those with signs of abnormal health and behavior and that there is direct and frequent communication of those
observations to the attending veterinarian.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
This facility currently has no record of animals on hand, no records of acquisition, and incomplete records of disposition of
animals. The facility is still not tracking offspring born at the facility. The licensee stated that he does not record births
until the animals are separated from their mothers for sale (and then only tracks through sales receipts). The licensee
acknowledged that records of animal deaths or euthanasia are not recorded. The licensee stated that many of the
animals he maintains (including fox, raccoon, skunk, and mink) frequently give birth to more offspring than they
successfully wean, but that these deaths are not recorded. When asked how many animals are currently on hand at the
facility, the licensee was not sure of the exact number and was not able to provide any record of animals on hand. He
stated that there had been no changes since the prior APHIS inspection and that the numbers should be the same.

Failure to maintain disposition records such as records of the described pre-weaning deaths prevents the licensee,
attending veterinarian, and APHIS Officials from evaluating mortality to determine possible causes and/or compliance with
the AWA. Failure to maintain complete and accurate records of acquisition, disposition, and record of animals on hand


prevents APHIS officials from tracing animal movement and from completely assessing other are aspects of compliance
with the AWA. Correct by ensuring that the facility maintains complete and accurate records of all animals on hand, all
animal acquisitions (including the total offspring born of any animal while in his possession or under his control) and
animal dispositions (including those which die, are euthanized, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of). These records
must include all information required by this section, must be maintained in an accurate and timely manner, and must be
made available for inspection by APHIS Officials.

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
Four raccoons were not made available for inspection by APHIS Officials. On the previous inspection 4 juvenile raccoons
were being held by the licensee housed in primary enclosures that did not meet requirements for adequate space so that
they could be bottle reared. When asked where these animals were currently being housed, the licensee stated that he
had moved them to his daughter’s residence and that she was assisting him by bottle rearing them until they were ready
for sale. When inspectors asked to go to that location to inspect the housing facilities, animals, food, etc. the licensee
stated that his daughter was at work and that he did not have access to that property. He stated that he could have the
animals brought to his property to show them to inspectors the following day, but reiterated that he was unable to provide
access to the animals at that time. Failure to allow access to all locations at which animals are housed prevents
inspectors from assessing the animals, primary enclosures, and care provided to those animals in order to ensure
compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by 9/2/2022 by ensuring that APHIS Officials are able to enter all
locations that animals are housed or otherwise being held during business hours.

Contingency planning.


The facility does not have a contingency plan. Instructions and APHIS form 7093 were provided at the last inspection. At
inspection today, the form remained blank and no other contingency document has been developed. In the event of
emergency animals may suffer due to the lack of preparedness. Licensee must develop, document, and follow an
appropriate plan to provide for the humane care of their animals in the event of emergency or disaster.

Facilities, general.
Many enclosures remain in need of repair:
*The wire mesh floor in one red fox enclosure on the far side of the property is in severe disrepair with large holes in the
wire. The largest hole is large enough that an inspector was able to reach her entire hand up through the floor of the
enclosure. This is easily large enough for the fox to pass entire legs and/or their head through and there are sharp points
from broken wires around the entire hole. This hole is currently large enough that there is a significant risk of animal
escape. Additionally, there are other areas of broken wires protruding up into the enclosure in front of the feeder where
the animal would need to stand to feed and sharp edges resulting from rust on the feeder itself. The licensee stated that
he was aware these older enclosures in the back of the property were not in good condition, however, he just hasn’t had
time to move the fox to another enclosure. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound in kept in good repair to
prevent injury and to contain the animals.

*Sharp points remain on multiple fox, skunk, mink, and ferret enclosures where holes have been cut to accommodate
feeders and access doors. Many areas the wire floors have broken wires protruding into the enclosure. Although the
licensee has addressed several areas of sharp points documented on the last inspection report, at least 40% of
enclosures continue to have sharp points resulting from broken wires, holes, rusted feeders, etc.



*The Sika deer enclosure has large gaps along the bottom with broken and tangled wire. One of the posts is loose and a
whole section of fence is slanted on the back side of the enclosure. One of the posts is broken, the top portion hanging
into the enclosure. Many areas of the fence are crumpled, some with repair attempts made, but remain loose, posing an
injury threat to the deer as well as allowing access for other animals, like coyotes or dogs, to enter the enclosure.

*A created opening in one Arctic fox enclosure wall is being aggressively chewed on by the fox, causing an expansion of
the opening, creating sharp edges which could break teeth or cause other injuries.

*A large tree limb has fallen on top of a few of the fox enclosures crushing the enclosure tops down into the animal space.
The weight of the limb has impacted the structural integrity of the enclosure from underneath.

*The animals have access to these areas of disrepair and can easily be severely injured and/or entangled. The tree limb
may fall further crushing the animals and below. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.

Facilities, outdoor.
Thirty-six Arctic fox and four Red fox remain in enclosures without shelter. The enclosures are made of approximately 1-
inch square wire. There is a piece of tin siding placed on top of the enclosures and a moderate sized rectangle of solid
material on the west side of the individual pens, but the animals are not protected from blowing wind, rain, and snow.
Without adequate protection the animals are prone to exposure stress and disease hazards. Shelter shall be provided for

Space requirements.
Thirty- six arctic foxes and four red foxes are housed in wire mesh enclosures up off the ground with 2-3 animals per
enclosure. There are no hide boxes for these animals to protect them from the elements and no visual barriers from
anything around them.

Many of the juvenile arctic foxes were moved to an enclosure with no box so they would not rub their fur off in the box,


according to the licensee. Normal postural and social adjustments for this species is to live in dens which provide cover
and the ability to evade predators. These arctic foxes are now adjacent to enclosures housing and/or within visual,
auditory, and olfactory proximity of red fox which are natural predators to them. There are no barriers or hides from these
stressors. The animals have no way to reduce their stress levels. This is showing through the abnormal behaviors
displayed.

Most of these arctic foxes in these open enclosures are displaying significant signs of stress, expressed as abnormal
behaviors for the species. Signs include frantic pacing or jumping back and forth in the enclosure and over cage mates,
freezing in a standing position on the side mesh trying to get as far away from the inspectors, staying curled in a tight ball
while growling continuously, and/or excessively pawing at the water for extended periods of time.

Red foxes, while being a semi social species, need to have the ability to avoid conflict with cage mates either through
space, visual barriers or varying elevated areas. The red foxes in these open enclosures are also showing signs of stress.
One fox was biting repeatedly at the wire mesh which can potentially injure the animal’s mouth and teeth. Another red fox
was scratching at the base of the wire mesh repeatedly. Several other red foxes were observed jumping back and forth
repeatedly in the enclosure, often jumping over a cage mate with no avoidance possible.

Being subjected to prolonged stress, captive animals with no way to navigate their enclosure or engage in social
adjustments like hiding, will cause suffering if not alleviated.

Feeding.


*The approximately 8 year old male bobcat is extremely underweight. The vertebrae on the back are easily visible along
with prominent hips and a concave tuck at the abdomen. Currently the licensee states he feeds the two bobcat every
other day a total of 1 frozen thawed muskrat (wild-caught origin) and 4 pieces of chicken in various sizes and amounts.
This diet amount is not sufficient quantity or nutrition to enable this animal to maintain a healthy weight or add additional
weight leading into the fall and winter months. Additionally, feeding wild-caught prey without conducting regular parasite
testing, presents a risk to the health of the Bobcat. All animals must be fed once a day unless otherwise dictated by
hibernation, veterinary treatment, normal fasts or other professionally accepted practices. This animal is being fasted 3-4
days a week, only offered food every other day. Given the extremely poor body condition of this animal, fasting every
other day is not appropriate and is not adequate feeding.

*The majority of the fox, skunk, raccoon, mink, and ferret exhibited signs of diarrhea and or loose stool underneath the
enclosures. Stools appeared watery and/ or with mucus. The licensee is currently feeding a mix of dog and cat food as
the base diet to these species. When asked the licensee stated that the animals have loose stool because he feeds a
high fat diet. All diets fed to animals must be of appropriate nutritive value to maintain animals in good health. Prolonged
diarrhea can lead to dehydration and unnecessary discomfort.

*Failure to provide adequate feed can result in poor body condition and unnecessary suffering. Ensure that all animals
are provided appropriate diet of sufficient nutritive value and quantity for optimal animal health and welfare. Additionally,
since the current diets are associated with concerns in animal health, the attending veterinarian must be contacted and
provide guidance and appropriate feeding plans for these animals.

3.129(b) Repeat

Feeding.
*A few of the food receptacles still have moldy food at the base of the food receptacle. Plastic coffee containers are
recycled and used as food receptacles in many enclosures. These feed receptacles are entirely contained within wire that
has 1-inch holes. The only larger holes are where animals access the feed and where feed is added from the outside of
the enclosure. The design prevents removal of the feed container to remove old feed and or adequately clean feeders.
The licensee stated that he typically waits until feed is empty to refill in order to prevent molding. He also stated that he
cleans them by spraying feed out with the hose then letting it air dry before re-filling. Because of the awkward design of
these containers, the food can get stuck down in the rim at the base of the feeder making it difficult for the animals to get
to, leaving the food to cake and mold. A few feeders have been contaminated with feces that must be removed. All
feeders must be kept in good repair to facilitate cleaning and must be kept clean to minimize contamination of the food
supply.

*A few of the plastic containers are heavily chewed and worn and need to be replaced. There are plastic pieces
underneath a few enclosures and there is a concern of chewed plastic pieces becoming an ingestion hazard.
3.130 Direct Repeat

Watering.
*The inspection process began mid-afternoon at 2pm eastern time. The licensee stated he waters the animals daily in the
afternoon or evening. At the start of the inspection, approximately 85% of the water receptacles were dry. Several foxes
and raccoon were observed pawing at the empty water receptacle in their enclosure. At the request of the inspectors, the
licensee began to give water to sections of animals at a time during the inspection walk through process. Multiple animal
species including the red fox, arctic fox, raccoon, striped and spotted skunks, and mink would then drink and consume


water for prolonged periods of time. At least 40-50 animals were observed drinking water excessively. Several fox,
skunk, and raccoon drank for nearly 2 minutes continuously, or paused briefly when startled by a person’s presence, only
to return to drink again as soon as it felt comfortable to do so. The licensee stated that animals frequently immediately
“dig” all the water out of their water receptacles and also that some animals “just drink more”. The eagerness and length
of time spent consuming water indicates that the animals were very thirsty and that only offering water once daily is not
sufficient. The facility must provide water as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals.

*Additionally, multiple water receptacles are still dirty with grime, debris, and/or a white flakey film that is not being
cleaned out prior to fresh water being offered. Dirty water receptacles contaminate water and may lead to animal illness.
Water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary to provide water that is free from contamination.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
*There is still a large accumulation of feces and fecal piles under the red fox, arctic fox, raccoon, mink, and skunk
enclosures. Some of the fecal piles underneath the enclosures are several inches high and some run along the support
beams of the enclosure. This accumulation is contributing to strong ammonia and fecal odor around the area.

*There are feces all around the edges of the bobcat enclosure on the ground. The licensee hoses the feces out of the
primary enclosure but then leaves it in the rocks directly adjacent to the concrete slab. These feces must be removed as
often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors around the animal areas.

*The large raccoon enclosure with the red nest box has a large pile of feces left on the top of the box. This enclosure
needs to be cleaned more frequently to remove this waste and keep the animals from becoming soiled.



Correct by ensuring that feces are removed from primary enclosures an as often as necessary to prevent accumulation of
excreta, contamination of animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors.
