ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
CRITICAL NCI
***A Scottish Highland with a head wound received conservative treatment for 21 days before the attending
veterinarian was contacted. Records dated 5/14/14 outlined a recommendation by the attending veterinarian to
evaluate and treat a head wound for the Scottish Highland, as soon as possible. The recommended treatment was
delayed 6 days, per the facility representative.
Records dated 5/23/14, indicated the veterinarian recommended a more aggressive treatment for the head wound.
The facility representative elected to delay such treatment until the routine monthly veterinary visit in June 2014.
The date of the monthly visit had not been scheduled at the time. The conservative treatment was continued until
5/30/14.
The attending veterinarian must have the authority to treat diseases, illnesses, and injuries as deemed appropriate.
Recommendations of the attending veterinarian must be followed to ensure animals receive adequate veterinary
care and are not subjected to unnecessary pain and distress. Procedures must be implemented to ensure the
attending veterinarian has the authority to diagnosis and treat diseases, illnesses, and injuries appropriately and in a
timely manner.
2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Records indicate a Scottish Highland had a head wound on 4/25/14. The wound was treated conservatively for
35 days with a topical antiseptic, a 5-day course of antibiotic treatment, and an antiparasitic. There was no
significant improvement of the wound during this time. Although the animal was observed daily, there was little
communication with the attending veterinarian regarding the deteriorating condition of the head wound. The animal
received a proper diagnosis and treatment 36 days after the head wound was noticed.The lack of communication with the attending veterinarian resulted in the animal receiving a prolonged, ineffective
treatment for the head wound and being subjected to unnecessary pain and distress. There must be timely and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian of any disease condition, illness, or injury to ensure a proper
diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for the animal. A method of direct and frequent communication with the
attending veterinarian must be implemented to ensure adequate veterinary care is received in a timely manner for
all animals.
