FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(c) Drainage: The following areas have an accumulation of water and mud:
1) There is a large muddy area with puddles of water by the water receptacle in the enclosure housing three bison.
2) There is a large muddy area with puddles of water by the water receptacle in the enclosure housing two alpaca.
The animals have to walk through the mud to get to the water receptacle. Walking through mud and water can
cause hoof problems such as foot rot. The mud and standing water can also attract insects which may transmit
diseases and/or annoy the animals. The drainage must be improved to rapidly eliminate excess water to prevent
muddy conditions and to protect the health of the animals.

Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: The cloth covering the back fence of the enclosure housing one wallaby has large
horizontal rips with holes near the bottom of the fence. The wallaby was laying down in front of the back fence with
the torn cloth. The wallaby may get a body part caught in the torn cloth moving along the back fence or become
tangled in the ripped cloth if it sticks its head through a hole in the cloth to look out through the fence. The torn cloth
on the back fence of the wallaby enclosure must be removed or repaired to prevent injury to the wallaby.
