Facilities, general.
The black bear enclosure is divided into two sections, the natural area and the cement area that consists of the inground
pool and shelter building. The shift door between these two areas is constructed with metal and framed with metal trim.
The base of this shift door framework has rusted and deteriorated thus exposing holes and an area of jagged metal on the
natural side. The black bear could injure his feet and/or legs while entering or exiting to either side of the enclosure. The
damaged framework shall be repaired to protect the black bear from injury and to maintain the structural strength of the
doorway.

TO BE CORRECTED BY: SEPTEMBER 21, 2022
