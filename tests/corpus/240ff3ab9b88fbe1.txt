FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation.
There was a strong ammonia odor in the facility during inspection. I noted my throat and eyes burned slightly due to
the odor. Strong ammonia odors can cause animals to do poorly and get sick easier. While maintaining the
building temperature at least 60 degrees F, enough fresh airflow must be provided to prevent strong odors in the
building where animals live.

WATERING.
Almost all the water bottles (about 12) on the left side of the building (while facing the heater) had a dark buildup
inside of them. Some water bottles (3) in on the right side were also observed to have a buildup of dark material on
the inside. Dirty water containers could contaminate the water and make many animals sick. Water containers
must be sanitized at least once every two weeks but more often if they ever get dirty.
