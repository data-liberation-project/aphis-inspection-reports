2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were no current formal arrangements between the licensee and a veterinarian available at the time of the
inspection. The last visit was annotated in 2014. Without regularly scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian,
there is no way to ensure that the animals at the facility are receiving adequate care. The attending veterinarian
must visit the facility and agree that he/she still agrees with the formal arrangements, and make any corrections or
changes if he/she does not.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
During the inspection, it was discovered that two Tamarins that were identified during the last inspection were no
longer at the facility. The licensee refused to provide the inspector with any information regarding where the
animals had gone stating " I did not sell the animals, I gave them away so I don't have to tell you anything." I
informed the licensee at least twice that according to the AWA, the disposition of all animals, regardless of if or how
they left the facility or if a profit was made or not, must be made available during the inspection. At that point the
licensee became visually frustrated and told the inspector "the government already knows too much about me. I
have never had to tell the inspector where my animals go and I am not going to do it now." In front of the licensee, I
then showed the male employee working with her how to navigate to the animal care website, and walked him
through ordering animal disposition forms. After that I informed the licensee again that providing information on the
animals that left the facility was required, her response was "I wish I still had my last inspector." I informed her that
by refusing to provide me with the information, I would have to cite the infraction on her inspection report. Refusing
to cooperate during the inspection process makes it impossible to properly conduct the inspection as required. She
told me she did not care, and that I could write whatever I wanted on the report, again stating that she had no
intention of letting the government know what she does with her animals. The disposition of every regulated animal
must be provided in order to ensure that the animals were transferred in a safe and legal manner. Provide all
required information during the inspection process. Correct Immediately.
A full exit briefing was not able to be concluded due to a refusal by the licensee to provide all required inspection
documents to ACI 6021.
