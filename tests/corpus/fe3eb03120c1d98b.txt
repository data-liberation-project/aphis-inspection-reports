Facilities, general.
In Golden Dome stadium, there are areas that are not being maintained in good repair. On stage, there are areas with
rough edges and chipping paint that animals may come into contact with; The ramp and staircase leading to the dive
platform has two areas of exposed foam with rough edges of chipped paint. The front edge of the center stage has an
area approximately 12 inches wide and 10 inches back with missing paint and exposed cement. During the sealion
performances, animals slide across the stage, climb up this ramp and may come in contact with these areas of concern.
At the concrete audience barrier, there is concrete pitting and paint flecking which sealions may also come into contact
with throughout the shows. In sealion housing, there is flecking paint over sealion enclosures. The back of the dome’s
stage has large areas of paint chipping and concrete cracks that are above sealion enclosures. Flakes of chipped paint
and concrete may fall into enclosures and be ingested by the animals. Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for marine
mammals must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. To be
corrected by December 16, 2022.
3.103(c)

Facilities, outdoor.


The facility’s perimeter fence has a section, near the western side of the Miami Seaquarium dock, where the bottom of the
chain link fence is not flush with the ground substrate. There is a gap approximately 12 inches wide and 14 inches deep
under this section of fence. Animals and unauthorized people can use these gaps to enter and exit the area and gain
access to the animals behind it. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects marine mammals by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the marine
mammals, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility when appropriate.
