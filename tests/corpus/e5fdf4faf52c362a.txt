Contingency planning.
There was no written contingency plan available at time of this inspection. Failure to have a written contingency plan can
result in lack of readiness for emergencies or disasters which could impact animal health and well-being. Facilities must
develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing,
and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster.

Facilities, general.
In the goat pen there was an approximately 6 ft. section of chain link fencing along the bottom which was in disrepair.
Chain link wires were bent and some of the sharp, loose wire ends were protruding into the enclosure. Additionally, the
plastic lattice material used to cover some sections along the bottom of this fence has become loose or detached and
broken creating some sharp points or edges. Fencing material in disrepair with loose, pointed ends may potentially cause
the animals to be injured or trapped. All enclosures must be maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals
from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and maintenance must be in


place.
