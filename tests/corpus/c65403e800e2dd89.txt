2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There are some aspects of veterinary care as well as general animal care that the attending veterinarian has not been
given proper authority to oversee adequacy:

- Facility representatives and the attending veterinarian do not remember when the veterinarian last walked through the
entire facility to assess the health and husbandry of every single animal. Both sides explained that such a visit does not
occur regularly and has not happened in a long time, at least more than one year. Without regular, thorough, and
complete visits, the veterinarian cannot fully assess the animals’ living conditions and therefore does not oversee the
adequacy of all aspects of animal care and use.

- The facility has received guidance on animal care from other consultants and consulting veterinarians but did not inform
or receive approval from the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian confirmed not having been made aware of
any of the following occurrences:
o A Bengal tiger, Sheila, has 2 small circular red hairless lesions on her left hind limb. They are both approximately the
size of a penny, one on her thigh and the other at the top of her foot (hock). A consulting veterinarian pointed this out to a


facility representative and indicated it might need further investigation.
o A white-faced capuchin named Calvin is being given medications every 6 to 8 hours instead of every 12 hours as
indicated in the instructions. Per a facility representative, a consulting veterinarian approved this change in time interval.
o The Bengal tiger Sheila is now being fed mostly boneless meat per the guidance of a consultant since per a facility
representative she did not eat the bone and seemed to have some difficulty eating bone-in meat. All the other wild cats
are now fed a mix of boneless and bone-in meat instead of all bone-in meat per the recommendation of the same
consultant.
o The black bear, Tuffy, is being given medications in peanut butter sandwiched by 2 graham crackers again per the
recommendation of a consultant.

- The attending veterinarian also stated not having reviewed or approved the diet composition or supplements currently
fed to any of the wild cats housed at the facility.

When the veterinarian is not given the appropriate authority, the provision of veterinary care may be inadequate or
inappropriate. The licensee must assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision
of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. To be corrected by

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Communication between the facility and the attending veterinarian is overall insufficient and indirect in conveying
information on animal health and well-being. Most of the conversation is being held via email and the following failures in
communication have occurred:



- A facility representative and the attending veterinarian have both expressed experiencing a lack of responsiveness from
the other on aspects relating to animal care.

- A male brown lemur has a golf ball sized circular mass on the left side of his neck. The attending veterinarian explained
requesting a keeper’s assistance from the facility in order to restrain the primate and perform an aspirate of the mass. The
facility planned on scheduling the procedure but due to scheduling issues, failed to do so. No further communication was
had on the topic and the primate remained as is with a facility representative explaining that they are monitoring the
condition.

- The facility identified certain animals in need of care and planned on consulting on some items with other veterinarians
but did not communicate the findings with the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was not aware of the
following:
o The lion liberty being overweight. A consulting veterinarian stated having discussed this with the facility.
o A black and white pot belly pig with his abdomen hanging very low, almost dragging on the ground. The facility identified
this condition and scheduled an appointment with another consulting veterinarian for examination.

- Ongoing communication with the attending veterinarian about the progress or change in condition of animals with
chronic ailments is not occurring. The current state of the tiger Sheila and the black bear Tuffy, both with pre-existing
chronic conditions, have not been communicated with the attending veterinarian for the establishment of a plan for future
treatments or ongoing progress updates:


o The tiger Sheila was prescribed by the attending veterinarian a supplement for arthritis approximately 3 months ago.
Since, per a facility representative, Sheila is more mobile, but her gait continues to be abnormal. During inspection, she
was seen walking slowly, deliberately, putting one paw down completely before lifting the other. While walking, Sheila’s
back was hunched and the top of her hind feet (the hocks) were dropped on both sides, touching the ground with each
step. The attending veterinarian was not aware of this gait and explained it to be different from what she had seen before.
She expressed the need to examine the animal for diagnosis and to develop a treatment plan.
o The black bear Tuffy was also prescribed by the attending veterinarian medication for his arthritis approximately 3
months ago. Per a facility representative, he is more mobile and active but he continues to have an abnormal gait. During
inspection, the bear was seen walking slowly with his left front foot in a continuous state of extension and swaying his
head slightly after every step and when standing. Tuffy’s right eye was also abnormal with some whiteness within the
pupil and a cloudy white ring around the Iris. When asked, the facility representative explained that he has and always
had cataracts. The attending veterinarian explained not having examined the bear in a long time and could not recall what
his eye looked like last and did not know if the condition had changed. She also did not know if the bear’s gait changed
since prescribing the medication.

Communication with the attending veterinarian on newly identified animal problems is necessary to establish a plan of
action. Furthermore, ongoing communication on pre-existing conditions is crucial in order to communicate the current
state of an animal for the establishment of a new treatment plan if needed or a progress update schedule. The lack of
frequent and direct communication between the facility and the attending veterinarian could lead to a delay in treatment
for animals in need. A more rigorous as well as effective mechanism of direct and frequent communication must be


established so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to
the attending veterinarian. To be corrected by January 26, 2023.

Facilities, outdoor.
The chain link perimeter fence surrounding the outdoor enclosures containing mainly dangerous animals, such as tigers
and bears, had multiple sections in disrepair and was less than 8 feet or even 6 feet in height in many areas.

On the east side of the facility, a very large tree was downed over an approximately 10 foot section of fence. The fence
immediately below the fallen three was destroyed and almost at ground level while the areas surrounding were crumpled,
reduced to less than 8 feet in height. On the same side, due to ground erosion, there was a dip in a large section of fence
which sunk to a height of approximately 4 feet.

On the south side of the facility, another large tree was downed, resulting in an approximately 6 foot section of fence at
about 5 feet in height. On the same side, two additional areas of damaged fence were identified, one 5 feet in height while
the other was 4 feet in height. The gate on the south side, also part of the perimeter fence, was only about 5 feet in
height.

On both the south and east side, there are areas of vegetation overgrowth from the outside of the facility leaning on top
and across the fence. In addition, against a large section on the east side, many large plastic bags containing mulch were
stacked up approximately 4 to 5 feet high and propped up against the fence. These further compromises the effectiveness
of the fence in making it easier for animals to climb and come through the perimeter fence from both sides.



The lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within the facility in that there isn’t an
adequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient barrier
to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The facility must ensure an 8-foot-high perimeter fence for dangerous
animals and a 6-foot-high fence for non-dangerous animals as well as non-human primates. Such fence must be at least
3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure for outdoor housed animals. To be corrected by January 27, 2023.

Feeding.
During inspection, feeding inadequacies were observed in 2 areas:
- Approximately the top 1/3 of the round bale of hay in the “motley crew” enclosure was damp and dark brown in color.
The inner parts of the top layers were rotten and mainly black in color with some small areas of white-fuzzy mold like
material. This bale was the only source of hay for the 10 goats and 5 pigs within the enclosure.
- Per the directions for use of the carnivore supplement (a source of calcium among other nutrients) added to the diet, the
facility is underdosing the wild cats, the foxes, and the wolf-dog hybrid. For most of those animals, the facility is providing
approximately a little less than half of the required amount of supplement which per the directions for use half would
suffice if the animals were fed all bone-in-meat. However, per a facility representative, the animals’ diet is an equal mix of
boneless and bone-in meat. In addition, a Bengal tiger named Sheila is also being given less than half the required
amount of supplement even though she is mostly being given a bone-less diet since per a facility representative she does
not eat bone. Therefore, this supplement is the main source of calcium for Sheila yet she is being given a severely low
dose for her requirements. The bone content in the diet as well as the amount of supplement added for each animal was
not discussed with or approved by the attending veterinarian.
Feed contaminated with rot or mold may be unwholesome as well as unpalatable to the animals and could result in
illness. Underdosing animals on supplements containing vital nutrients such as calcium without prior consultation with a


veterinarian may negatively impact their health and overall well-being of the animals. The facility must ensure the food
given to the animals is wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health.

Employees.
On November 15th, 2022, an employee incorrectly administered an oral medication to the black bear Tuffy resulting in a
bite to their hand that required hospitalization for medical intervention. The employee had the bear take the medication
hidden in food directly from her hand instead of placing it on the ground as is customary for the facility. The employee, a
longtime volunteer, was only recently hired and occupied this position for approximately 1 month before this incident. Per
the employee, she had never administered medications to the animals before, she was never trained to do so, and
mentioned never having observed another employee giving medications in her time at the facility. A facility representative
explained that the newly hired employee volunteered to give medications because the keeper responsible for the task was
out on leave that day. The lack of training lead to the inadequate administration of medications which resulted in
significant injury to the employee and could have severely harmed the bear as well. It is the facility’s responsibility to
adequately train their employees and assess their qualifications before allowing them to conduct any task especially those
involving animal interaction. The facility must ensure that there is a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to
maintain an acceptable level of husbandry practices while under the supervision of someone with a background in animal
care. To be corrected by January 13, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
