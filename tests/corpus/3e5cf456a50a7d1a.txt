not been spot cleaned daily. There was an excessive accumulation of feces throughout these enclosures. The
licensee stated that these enclosures had not been cleaned for a few days due to the rainy weather. This causes
increased contamination to the enclosed animal, and a risk of illness. Enclosures must be cleaned as often as
necessary to maintain good husbandry and help protect the health of the enclosed animal. The enclosures also

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- The building numbered F7 housing the black and white ruffed lemur and the oriental small-clawed otter had an
excessive accumulation of rodent feces present on the floor concentrated along the walls and the corners of the
enclosure. The sealed food container in the area had rodent feces on the lid. The licensee stated that sticky traps
were being used.
- The round house for three ring tailed lemurs had an excessive accumulation of rodent feces on the floor
concentrated along the walls, thresholds and the corners of the enclosure.
- There were numerous dead and live insects in the sinks in the commissary. There was a box of food sitting on the
floor in the commissary area and a trailer with boxes of unrefrigerated meat that the licensee stated was not going
to be fed to his anmials for various reasons such as too high in fat. Many flies were noted on these products.
The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote the health andwell-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. All rodent excreta must be removed
as needed and an effective program initiated to control the pests.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The wire fencing on the north for the camel enclosure is loose and large gaps approximately a foot high and 7 feet
long are present. The pen has an area where the entire fence is leaning inward along with the wooden post. Loose
fencing can result in harm or escape of the enclosed animals, and may allow other animals to enter the pen.
- The wire on the south side of the pig, donkey and llama enclosure is loose and sagging wire is present. This fence
is leaning inward and had approximately a foot of fence on the ground.
- Thre are many broken posts on the public barrier fence. The public barrier fence by the lynx had a broken post.
The public barrier fences by the road lemurs and porcupines are broken at ground level. These public barrier fences
are not structurally sound.
- There is a hole in the top panel of the leopards' enclosure. This hole is approximately 8 inches in diameter.
- The black bears shade structure had a broken board on the roof. This board is falling and dropping down into his
enclosure.
- There is a shredded wooden support post in the tiger enclosure with sharp points. This is a potential
source of injury to the enclosed animal. This area needs to be repaired or replaced to help protect the health and
welfare of the animal.
- The hyenas' enclosure has exposed nails on the roof of the shelter where boards had broken and fallen off. There
are also numerous boards that are broken and no longer structurally sound.
- The enclosure for Fireball the deer had a collapsed shelter roof. The shelter roof and bent metal heat lamp shield
are on the ground with sharp points of nails facing up.This poses a risk of injury to the animal, and also greatly
reduces the effectiveness of the shelter itself.
All loose, weak, broken or sagging wire fencing, and posts must be repaired or replaced and constructed of material
which will provide structural strength at all times, kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain
the animals. All parts of the housing facilities must be in good repair. These structures need to be replaced or
repaired.3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- The outdoor road pen with 3 crested porcupines has standing water in the middle erosion area of the pen and
extending into their sheltered area. One of the wooden shelters near the erosion has started to deteriorate. There
is a hole in the wall with an exposed nail and the wood flooring is wet . Improper drainage systems and standing
water where the animals are contained may result in odors, spreading of diseases, insect infestation and other
health hazards. All pens housing animals must have an adequate drainage system that is able to eliminate
standing and excess water more rapidly for the overall health of the animals. Correct by 06/14/14.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The primary enclosures for the ferrets had not been cleaned as often as necessary. There was an excessive
accumulation of feces throughout these enclosures. The licensee stated that these enclosures had not been
cleaned for a few days due to the rainy weather. This causes increased contamination to the enclosed animal, and
a risk of illness. Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to maintain good husbandry and help protect
the health of the enclosed animal.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
- The west side of the road enclosures and the east side perimeter fence areas have tall, thick brush and weeds up
to the enclosures. The building used as a food storage and food preparation area had a large number of dead and
live insects and rodent feces present on the floor along the walls, threshold areas. In addition, there is a flat bed
trailer with boxes of meat sitting outside in the sun on the south side of the food storage and food preparation
building. A high volume of flies and other insects are present on the boxes of meat and inside the facility. Licensee
indicated that the meat was not good and was not going to be fed to his animals. A large volume of flies and other
insects could lead to spreading of diseases, pest infestation and other health hazards Accumulation of items not
used for food storage or animal husbandry practices as well as tall weed and brush up to enclosures could lead to
pest/rodent infestation and nesting areas for pests/rodents. A stronger and more effective pest control program
must be established and maintained at all times. All items not used for food storage or animal husbandry practices
must also be removed for the overall health of the animals. The weeds and brush must be cut back from the
enclosures to aid in pest control and decrease nesting areas for pests.Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
