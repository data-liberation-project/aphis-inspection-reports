2.33(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
An expired bottle of 50% dextrose (expired July 2022) was found in the emergency crash cart in the surgery suite and
additional expired drugs were found in the pharmacy stock room (2 bottles of 50% dextrose and 1 bottle of epinephrine).
Expired medical products are not an appropriate method to control disease and injury in animals, especially in case of
emergencies. The facility must ensure appropriate methods are in place to control, diagnose and treat diseases and
injuries, which includes the use of unexpired drugs. Corrected at time of inspection.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the attending veterinarian and facility employee.
