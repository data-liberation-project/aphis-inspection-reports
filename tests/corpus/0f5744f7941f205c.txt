PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
** During the inspection three enclosures of puppies were observed with their feet passing through the raised wire
flooring. This could cause injury to the feet and/or legs and it also affects the puppies ability to walk in a normal
manner. The wire floor must be modified so that the feet and legs of the puppies do not fall through the openings in
the flooring. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have floors that are constructed
in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not
allow the dogs' feet to pass through any openings in the floor. To be corrected by: 10-15-15
