Housing facilities, general.
The enclosures housing gibbons and capuchin monkeys have metal framework that is rusted. Each enclosure has a run
attached that allows the animals to have access to a route of travel from one enclosure to another. These runs are
attached to the enclosures by a metal framework. The steel frameworks have rusted areas with flaking metal and
degraded surfaces which could prevent proper cleaning and sanitization. Proper cleaning and sanitization are essential
for removing excess debris and reducing unacceptable microorganisms that may be harmful to the animals. Any surfaces
that come in contact with nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and
sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface. To be corrected by December 30, 2022.
