3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Whereas many repairs and infrastructure improvements have been made to the surfaces within the non-human
primate enclosures, the following problems were observed:
Chimpanzees - Metal fixtures around windows and gates, and metal grates had some missing paint and significant
rust and deterioration, inside the night house.
Siamang - Paint peeling off of the wall above metal perches; concrete defect with missing paint.
Spider monkeys - concrete-like floor surface is peeling / flaking off, making it difficult to clean and sanitize.
Golden Lion Tamarins - These animals had nest boxes in their enclosures that were made of plywood. One was
removable, but the other was not, which would make it very difficult to clean. This box had unidentifiable debris
inside. Both had interiors comprised of bare plywood, which cannot be readily cleaned and disinfected.
All surfaces in the housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be constructed in a manner that allows them to be
adequately cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces should be kept in good repair and maintained or replaced on a regular
basis, in order to facilitate adequate cleaning and disinfection, and to protect the animals from harm. Peeling paint
and corrosion could present an ingestion risk, could threaten structural integrity, and impede adequate cleaning and
disinfection. Bare wood nest boxes cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected.
This issue has been cited previously, with correction dates previous to this inspection.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
