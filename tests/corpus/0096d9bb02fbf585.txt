The licensee didn’t contact their veterinarian after a male degu incurred a tail injury approximately one month ago. The

Untreated injuries can cause pain and discomfort in animals.

Contact the veterinarian regarding this animal’s condition. Follow any prescribed treatments or instructions. Ensure all
veterinary care issues are promptly reported to the veterinarian.
