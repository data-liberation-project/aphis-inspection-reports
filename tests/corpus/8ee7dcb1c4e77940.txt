The facility has a CO2 euthanasia chamber with CO2 tank and regulator. It in the past year it has been used to
euthanize rabbits and a hedgehog, among other species. Though hedgehogs are not included on the current
written program of veterinary care, all other species listed are directed to only to be euthanized by a veterinarian via
IV injection of pentobarbital. Animals may suffer when veterinary guidance is not followed. Each exhibitor shall

One of the reindeer is losing hair leaving a large bald patch of skin. Though Licensee attributed the condition to
shedding, normal shedding does not usually result in bare skin being revealed. Skin conditions such as, but not
limited to, bacterial and fungal infections may be contributing to the loss of hair. The reindeer must be examined by
a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and plan shall be maintained
for examination by APHIS officials.
One of the striped skunks has thinning hair on its tail. Licensee stated the condition has been diagnosed by the
attending veterinarian and requires no treatment. There are no documents available to reflect this statement. The
licensee maintains animal files, but the ones for the skunks were empty. Other animal records showed entries last
made in 2015. Accurate and up to date records assure animals receive appropriate treatment as recommended by
the attending veterinarian. Every facility should have a system of health records sufficiently comprehensive to
demonstrate the delivery of adequate health care.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records of animals on hand are confusing and incomplete. The records show more animals than are actually
present:
Three hedgehogs are listed on hand, but only one is present. One was stated to have been euthanized, it is
unknown when that occurred. The disposition for the second hedgehog is unknown.
Three skunks are listed on hand, but only two are present. The daily log notes reflect one skunk may have died or
been euthanized, but the exact event and date is unable to be determined by the records.
No guinea pigs are listed on hand, ten are present.
Fourteen reindeer are listed on hand, twelve are present. The facility also shows disposition records for three
reindeer. The records are confusing.
Six dogs and two cats are listed on hand. Five dogs and one cat are present. One cat was stated to have died, but
it is unknown when. The disposition of the dog is unrecorded. Without accurate and complete records it is impossible to trace animals in the event of a disease outbreak. Every
exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Reindeer are currently maintained in two pens. A third pen is under construction and will be ready to house the
deer in June. The reindeer feeding areas in the first pen has accumulated mud, moisture, and organic material.
Floor mats have been placed in an attempt to minimize the problem, though moisture persists. Wet ground and
mud around the water buckets and feed troughs in the first pen, and the alley leading to these areas in the second
pen, are such that the animals cannot avoid the mud and moisture. Spilled feed and other accumulated organic
material contribute to the conditions. Lameness and foot abscesses have been problematic for the deer. Suitable
methods shall be employed to eliminate excess accumulations of moisture.

SANITATION.
The Virginia opossums are in an enclosure that previously housed a bird. Bird droppings remain on the floor and
coat one of the branches provided in the pen for climbing. The kinkajou enclosures have a build up of dark organic
material on the some of the perches, enrichment items, and caging. The inside back wall of the coatimundi, lesser
tamandua, and Virginia opossum enclosures are made of wood. The wood has absorbed water from routine
cleaning and is now consistently moist.
The fecal material, organic bio-film, and warm, moist wood provides an environment suitable for disease agents to
flourish. Primary enclosures shall be constructed of a suitable material that allows effective cleaning and
sanitization, which shall be done as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards.

SANITATION.
A thick layer of dust, hair, and other organic debris is accumulated on surfaces of the housing facility including, but
not limited to, window sills, cat walkways, enclosure tops & sides, and corners. Though cleaned once last fall,
leaves and debris have accumulated on the tops of the outdoor enclosures for the coatimundi and groundhog.
Large amounts of accumulated clutter and husbandry items make cleaning all surfaces in the animal housing roomand feed storage barn a challenge. Accumulated dirt, dust, hair, and organic debris, as well as all the niches made
by the stored items, promote the development of pests and disease hazards. Premises (buildings and grounds)
shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate standard husbandry
practices.
