2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
This licensee made available for transport to another licensed facility three Eurasian Lynx kittens under 28 days of age.
The Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) shows an inspection date of 5/4/2020 with the kittens at 18 days of age. The
shipping date on the CVI matches the APHIS 7020 form provided by the licensee showing a transport date of 5/6/2020.
Neonatal nondomestic cats have special handing and husbandry needs and are placed in danger when they are exposed
to members of the public and/or stressful conditions, including transportation. Cubs under 4 weeks of age (28 days) do
not have a developed immune system, are susceptible to a wide variety of diseases including those of domestic cats, and
cannot thermoregulate. The licensee must ensure that handling of all animals be done as expeditiously and carefully as
possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. To be corrected from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
