2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1105 on
21-Mar-17. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I called the licensee and left a message. I then honked
my car horn. We waited a half hour in the driveway and no one came home. Later in the day, the licensee called
me and informed me that he was home at the time, but did not realize his phone was going off. I informed him we
would have to try the inspection another time.
End of report.
Additional Inspectors
Sime Debra, Veterinary Medical Officer
