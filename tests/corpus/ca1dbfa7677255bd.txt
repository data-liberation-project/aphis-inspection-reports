FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Interior surfaces. There are still large areas of bare wood on the floor in the guinea pig building where the white
paint is worn or scratched off. The paint on the wooden floor is not holding up to daily activity such as cleaning,
feeding, maintenance, and water spills. The interior building surfaces such as floors must be constructed and
maintained so that they are substantially impervious to moisture and can be readily sanitized.
Licensee has built new enclosures and installed linoleum on approximately half of the floor in the guinea pig building
since the previous inspection. The remaining section of floor that has bare wood present is still under construction.
Unsealed floors and surfaces are difficult to clean and sanitize, which can lead to disease hazards for the guinea
pigs. Correct by ensuring that the remaining wooden floor where bare wood is present is resealed or covered with
an impervious surface so that it can be repeatedly cleaned, sanitized, and from which won't retain odors or
absorbed moisture.
Remains uncorrected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
