2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:55 pm on
07-SEP-16.
I called the facility at 12:40 pm letting them know I was 15 minutes away and would like to conduct an inspection. I
arrived at the facility at 12:55 pm and knocked on the front door but no one answered. I stayed on the premises until
about 1:30 pm. I called before leaving letting them know that this is the second attempted inspection and that I
needed to inspect the animals. A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during
the inspection process.
