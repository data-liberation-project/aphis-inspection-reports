2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1219 on
06-FEB-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I rang the doorbell of the house located at the facility site. The person who answered the
door confirmed she continues not to be a representative for the facility, and indicated she had not seen the licensee
at the facility at that time. I then called Mr. Wilbur's primary phone number at 12:19 PM and left a message. I
located and then called the mobile number for Mr. Wilbur at 12:49 PM and left a message. Mr. Wilbur called back at
12:53 PM, and indicated he was unable to meet at the facility. He conveyed that no other representative was
available to meet at this time. However, Mr. Wilbur indicated his upcoming plan to identify other facility
representatives who could accompany APHIS during a future inspection. After our call, I left the facility.
