ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Mini Golden Doodle (#31) has an abnormal appearance to the right eye. There is hairloss on the skin
surrounding the eye and the skin in this affected area is also moist and slightly reddened. The white of the eye is
also mildly reddened. A brown crusted material is attached to the hair located around the eye and the hair beneath
the eye is wet. The facility representative stated the dog is not currently receiving treatment for the eye condition.
Abnormal eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the animal. The above mentioned dog must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. The licensee
must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell, VMO Scott Welch and the facility
representative.
