2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
On July 27, 2017 an anesthetized rabbit on a study protocol was to be injected with a contrast medium. Following
injection the rabbit immediately died. The technician realized that the stop-cock valve used for the procedure had
been turned in the wrong direction, the contrast medium had drained from the extension tubing, and air had been
injected instead. The technician explained that the stop-cocks that had been used historically had a valve that
turned in one direction and the new stop-cocks recently purchased have a valve that turns in the opposite direction.
The technician was aware of this, but stated that she turned the valve out of “muscle memory.” The facility
discarded the remaining stop-cocks that function in this manner.
On August 11, 2017 an employee attempted to socialize two dogs against the recommendation of veterinary staff.
One dog had a history of dog related aggression and had been removed from the facility socialization list due to the
risk of dog and/or staff injury. The dogs fought, both dogs received lacerations, and one dog required sutures. Both
dogs recovered and one of the two dogs has been adopted as a pet. Corrective action was taken by the facility.
Animals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar
problems from occurring in the future.
The inspection was focused on handling incidents that were self-reported to APHIS officials.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
