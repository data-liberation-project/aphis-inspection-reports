FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The temporary shelter provided for the 4 pigs is inadequate. It consists of three boards leaning against and partially
attached to trees, it provides very little protection from the rain and no protection from the cold. There is no shelter
provided in the enclosure for the 11 Sika deer. Exposure to inclement weather such as cold or freezing
temperatures, rain, and wind can cause illness and discomfort. Adequate shelter shall be provided to afford
protection from the inclement weather and prevent discomfort. Correct by March 10, 2017.

SANITATION.
The barn for the alpaca and goats is currently being used to store yard equipment and supplies. The majority of the
building is cluttered with the supplies and only the front entrance and corner are sectioned off by a chain link fence
panel to for the animals. The condition of the barn creates a safety hazard for the animals as well as a haven for
rodents. The barn shall be cleaned out and the area maintained to provide for the animals comfort and safety.
