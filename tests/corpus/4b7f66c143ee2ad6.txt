ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female shih tzu (Microchip # 026-287-585; DOB 4/11/06) has a right eye that is matted shut with a
yellow-green discharge covering both eyelids. When the eye was opened the surface of the eye appeared cloudy
and the white of the eye was mildly reddened. The surface of the left eye has a roughly circular indention
approximately 4x4 mm in size in the middle of the eye. The entire surface of the eye is cloudy in appearance and
there is clear drainage present on both eyelids and the surrounding hair.
One female shih tzu (Microchip # 042-861-095; DOB 2/17/08) has a swelling approximately 1 cm in diameter
between the middle toes on the right front foot and a swelling of approximately the same size between the middle
toes on the right back foot. Both areas are moderately red, swollen, and slightly warm to the touch. When gentle
pressure is applied to the swellings a red-tinged fluid is expressed.
These medical conditions can be painful and failure to seek medical attention can lead to further pain and
discomfort or other medical complications. These animals must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This
information must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
The dogs listed above must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by 5 pm on Wednesday, February 19, 2014.
All of the veterinary care items listed under 2.40 (b) (2) on the August 14, 2013 inspection report have been
