2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There are five, adult white-tailed deer and at least five adult Nubian ibex with overgrown hooves, affecting the angles of
their feet due to a lack of hoof trimming. The veterinarian evaluated these animals on September 9, 2021 and provided
contact information for a farrier to trim the hooves. The licensee told the inspectors at the last visit that the appointment
with the farrier was to occur at the time of the next veterinary visit, scheduled for September 23, 2021. As of the date of
inspection, the hooves remain untrimmed and the veterinarian has not returned to re-evaluate the animals. Until the
hooves are trimmed, the veterinarian's recommendation has not been followed. In addition, there is now a failure to
provide follow up veterinary care for the animals that were to be re-evaluated by the veterinarian on September 23: Two
white-tailed deer and five addax that are thin, one female oryx with a mass on its chest, and one lame female ibex that still
carries her left foreleg forward.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries, and lack of
follow-through for animals under veterinary care can worsen their condition and prolong their discomfort. The licensee
needs to follow the veterinarian's recommendations and must ensure that veterinary care is available for all the animals
when needed, to include follow up and any further diagnostics and treatment recommended by the veterinarian for
animals that are under veterinary care.


3.80(a)(2)(iii) Critical Repeat

Primary enclosures.
In the lemur barn, there is a juvenile lemur seen outside of a primary enclosure. The animal is small enough to squeeze
through the 2X4" fencing on the parents' enclosure, giving it free roam of the barn, other lemur enclosures, and potentially
the outside areas of the facility through windows and doors opened in the barn to facilitate ventilation. Primary enclosures
that do not contain the animals can facilitate escape and/or injury. Primary enclosures must be constructed and
maintained so that they contain the non-human primates securely.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees.
