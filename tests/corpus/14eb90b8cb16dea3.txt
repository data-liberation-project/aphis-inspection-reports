Two adult dogs were not recorded on APHIS 7005 (Record of Acquisition). Complete information for dogs on premises is
required and can be important for animal health tracing. Ensure that all dogs (including those there temporarily for
breeding) are recorded correctly on APHIS 7005.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The name and address of who picked up a litter of puppies on 1/15/22 was not legible on APHIS 7006. The licensee

important for animal health tracking. The name and address of the person any dog is sold or given to must be correctly


and fully disclosed on APHIS 7006-Record of Disposition.
