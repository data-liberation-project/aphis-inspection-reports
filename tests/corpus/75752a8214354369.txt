ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- The facility did not have an up-to-date APHIS Form 7002, Program of Veterinary Care, on hand showing the
change of attending veterinarian.

-The facility must have a written Program of Veterinarian Care that has been signed off and approved by the new
attending veterinarian. The veterinarian must review the Program of Veterinary Care, and sign and date the form
annually. A Program of Veterinarian Care is required to ensure that adequate measures are in place to ensure all
health issues are addressed in an appropriate and timely manner. Steps must be taken to ensure this noncompliant
does not repeat.

2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-Cheyenne, a 13 year old female wolf, was euthanized by gunshot. The director stated that Cheyenne was under
visual observation during March and April for an unspecified medical condition. The director stated that the animal
had been losing weight, not doing well, not eating sufficiently to maintain its weight, and was continuing to
deteriorate. However, no attempt to immobilize and physically examine or perform other diagnostics as part of a
routine veterinary examination was performed. A decision by the attending veterinarian was made on April 14th,
2015 from outside the enclosure that the wolf should be euthanized by gunshot without examination of the wolf. The
director stated that she searched for somebody capable of performing this act, and was unable to locate anyone.
On April 16 the order to euthanize Cheyenne by gunshot was given by the director. The gunshot euthanasia was
carried out in Cheyenne'(cid:25)s enclosure by an employee of the facility.
-This facility does not have personnel or veterinary staff trained to immobilize animals to conduct routine physical
examinations on animals that cannot be handled; nor can they respond to sick, injured or escaped animals to
provide adequate veterinary assessment, diagnostics, and care. Euthanizing a wolf or other dangerous carnivore bygunshot, without ever giving that animal the benefit of a medical work-up or performing any diagnostics, is not
adequate veterinary care for this industry. A program of training, acquiring trained staff, or an attending veterinarian
capable of performing sedation, restraint, operant conditioning for the purposes of veterinary assessment, routine
husbandry procedures, humane euthanasia and other tasks must be implemented to ensure the health and
well-being of the animals.

-Correct from this day forward.
-An exit interview was conducted with facility representative.
