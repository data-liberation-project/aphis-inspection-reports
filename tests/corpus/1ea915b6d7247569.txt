Facilities, outdoor.
One male elk was temporarily separated from the females in an enclosure which provided no natural or artificial shelter
from inclement weather. Lack of appropriate shelter could lead to health problems and/or discomfort of the animal. The
licensee must provide shelter appropriate to the local climactic conditions for all animals kept outdoors.
