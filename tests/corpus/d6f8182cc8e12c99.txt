FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is bare wood on the floor of the guinea pig trailer where the floor tiles are missing. The interior building
surfaces must be constructed and maintained so that they are substantially impervious to moisture and may be
readily sanitized. Unsealed wood on floor can become wet providing an optimal area for growth of bacteria and
mold which can cause animals to become ill. The missing floor tiles must be replaced or the wood sealed so that the
floor is impervious to moisture so it can be readily cleaned and sanitized.
