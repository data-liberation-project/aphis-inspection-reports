2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45AM on
13-MAR-17.The inspector knocked on the door of the facility and made contact with a family member. The family
member indicated that the licensee was away from the facility and would not be available for an inspection that day.
A business card was left at the facility with the request that the licensee call to re-establish hours of availability.
Lack of availability for inspection inhibits the regulatory process. The licensee must ensure a knowledgeable,
responsible adult is available during regular hours to accompany inspection.
Correct from this time forward
