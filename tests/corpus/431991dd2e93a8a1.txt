2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The kangaroo barrier fence is made of chain link attached to 4 inch diameter posts. Parts of the barrier fence are
loosely attached with twine and wood boards. The top of the chain link is bent downward which may allow the public
to come in direct contact with the animals. Barrier fences should be kept in good repair and constructed in a manner
that prevents direct public contact. The barrier fence must be repaired in a manner that minimizes public contact
with the animals. Correct by July 30, 2015
