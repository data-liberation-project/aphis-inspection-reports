3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An enclosure containing one rabbit had an aluminum soda can that the rabbit had chewed holes into and dented
thereby creating sharp edges and points. Aluminum soda cans are routinely used for enrichment for the rabbits at
this facility. These sharp points and ingestion can cause injury to the rabbit.
Primary enclosures and the materials in them should be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The
facility removed the aluminum can at the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
