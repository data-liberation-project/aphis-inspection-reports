WATERING.
The tigers water receptacle is empty and not in working order. The tigers do have water to drink from their pool
however it is not potable due to cleaning chemicals and excreta.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health
and comfort of the animal. Frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the
animal.
Corrected - Potable water is being provided until the water receptacle is repaired or replaced.
