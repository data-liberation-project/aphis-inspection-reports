ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white and grey male Shih-tzu approximately 9 years old (microchip number 941-0000-1670-1716) has a problem
with both eyes. The left eye has a protruding "bubble-like" bulge on the pupil that is clear in appearance with a small
spot of grey in the center. The bulge is approximately one quarter inch in diameter. The center of the interior portion
of the right eye is cloudy and grey in color. There is a dark brown crusty matter in the fur around the edges of both
eyes.
A white, grey and red male Shih-tzu approximately 9 years old (microchip number 0922-8062-4) has a problem with
its right eye. The eye appears cloudy with a blue-grey color, making it difficult to visualize the pupil and other interior
parts of the eye. The surface of the eye surrounding the cloudy portion is a pink color. The dog is also missing
several teeth. At least one tooth was observed loose after the inspector applied light pressure to the top tooth in the
center. Several remaining teeth have a dark brown discoloration next to the gums. Loose teeth can be painful and
impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and harm the health of the animal.
The abnormal appearance of the animal's eyes could be an indication of injury, infection or other medical issues
that could be painful. The licensee must have both animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain a diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of these consultations must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times, including the
use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnosis, and treat diseases and injuries.
