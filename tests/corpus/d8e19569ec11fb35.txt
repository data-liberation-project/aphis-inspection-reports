2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility had began giving a new dewormer called Wazine to the adult guinea pigs, although currently is not using
the medication. The written program of veterinary care does not list Wazine as an approved dewormer for the
guinea pigs. The use of medications without guidance from the attending veterinarian can cause animals to get sick
or may not cure their condition as intended. The facility must contact the attending veterinarian for approval and
obtain detailed written instructions (what to give it for, how much to give, how to give the medication, for how long,
and how often) before using Wazine and any other medication that does not have factory label instructions for
guinea pig use.
Correct immediately.
3.25(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the upper building; a guinea pig was seen outside of its primary enclosure. It was quickly and gently captured by
the licensee without incident. The licensee said that the young ones sometimes squeeze through an area by the
water sipper valve and sometimes climb up on the feeders and get over the enclosure wall. Animals must not
escape their primary enclosure because they could get injured, they may get in an area where there is no food or
water and their well-being cannot be guaranteed. Ensure that enclosures are maintained in a manner that contains
the animals and protects them from injury.
Correct by 4/21/17.
