ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Bongo has been non weight bearing on his right rear leg since February 6, 2016. The veterinarian has been
treating this animal medically since then with no visible improvements.
On June 8th the zoo received an estimate for radiographical services. The zoo does not have a radiograph
machine and has an appointment for this animal to receive radiographs on June 28th. The delay in obtaining
radiographs is due to the fact that the zoo must go through an approval system for purchases of supplies,
equipment & services which can frequently be a lengthy process. This current ordering process does not facilitate
any animal getting the necessary veterinary care (&/or diagnostic workups) to relieve pain and suffering in a timely
manner if the zoo does not have prior approval for the supplies, equipment or services in place or already has it at
the zoo.
The zoo must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care to include the appropriate equipment
and services to comply with the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act regulations and standards. A system of quickly
obtaining the necessary supplies, equipment, & diagnostic services to relieve animal pain & suffering must be in
place so that future delays do not occur.
Correct immediately.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There does not appear to be any improvement in the bongo. His right rear leg is still not weight bearing. The
veterinarian has changed the course of treatment without a definitive diagnosis due to the lack of radiographs which
might provide the etiology for this lameness.
The bongo has been receiving Phenylbutazone, Naflor, & Corti-Flex but the condition does not seem to be
improving. Radiographs are scheduled for June 28th (one week from today).Radiographs would be an important diagnostic tool since the condition has not improved medically, but this has yet
to take place despite the 4.5 month duration of this condition . An appropriate method to diagnose the problem has
not taken place yet.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Due to soil erosion there is a large drop off from 2 of the 3 bongo shelter entrances to the outside ground surface.
This animal is currently experiencing lameness and is not weight bearing on his right rear leg which has not been
definitively diagnosed. This can exacerbate the pain and discomfort if the animal needs to jump up or down to get
in or out of his shelter structure.
In this exhibit there are several areas around the entrance where there is exposed green coated chain link due to
soil erosion. These areas also pose a risk of further injury to the bongo if he should get entrapped or trip on these
areas.
The housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. This area shall be filled
in or the 2 entrances closed off so that the bongo does not have to jump in or out of the enclosure to gain access
into or out of the exhibit.
The exposed chain link shall be buried or removed so as not to cause a hazard to the animal.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The concrete floor at entrances to the bongo shelter are covered with wet clay mud. This mud is slippery which also
does not protect the bongo from further injury to its right rear leg (which is non weight bearing) as he enters and
exits the shelter
This mud shall be removed as often as necessary to provide a non slip surface for the injured bongo.
Correct by June 23, 2016.
This is a focused inspection limited to the bongo and his enclosure which was cited as a Direct non compliance on
the previous inspection.The exit interview was conducted with the veterinarian.
