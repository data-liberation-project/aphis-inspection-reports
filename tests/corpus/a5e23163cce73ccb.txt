Sanitation.
Numerous raccoon enclosures, including enclosures #019 and #026, have a buildup of food, grime, excreta and hair on
the enclosure sides and floors. A thick buildup of dark colored dirt and grime is coating the interior surfaces of the metal
bowls found in many of the enclosures. The licensee stated that the enclosures were last power washed three weeks
ago. Approximately 25 raccoons are housed in the affected enclosures. A buildup of dirt, grime, excreta and hair could
increase the risk of disease hazards towards the animals.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. The licensee must remove the buildup of
material from the surfaces of the enclosures and metal bowls in order to support the health of the raccoons.
