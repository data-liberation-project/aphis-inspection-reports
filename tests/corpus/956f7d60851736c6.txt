Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility currently has a singly housed nonhuman primate who was separated from other conspecifics due to a medical
condition identified in February of this year. In accordance with the facility's environmental enhancement plan, the staff
should be documenting animal welfare assessments for this animal on a monthly basis. While the staff have closely
observed the primate's health, the written assessments have not been completed since March. During the inspection, the
animal appeared healthy and was able to see and hear other nonhuman primates of their own species.
It's important to follow all components of a documented environmental enhancement plan to ensure the psychological
well-being of the animals when they are separated from a social environment.
Exhibitors, as directed by the attending veterinarian, must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for
environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The written
assessments should be documented monthly as prescribed in the written plan.
