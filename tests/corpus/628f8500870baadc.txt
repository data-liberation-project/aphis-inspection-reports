Notification of change of operation.
The registrant has moved from the building and failed to notify the Animal Welfare Operations Office. The move occurred
more than 10 days as ago per the new residents of the building. Failure to notify the Animal Welfare Operations Office in
changes of address doesn’t allow inspection for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, Regulations, and Standards.
2.126(b) Repeat

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:15 PM on 8-24-21.
I called the contact number and knocked on the facility door in attempts to reach the registrant. All attempts were
unsuccessful. I waited at the facility for 30 minutes and left.
