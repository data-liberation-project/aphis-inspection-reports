2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A current Program of Veterinary Care document was not available for review during inspection. The facility did have
a program of veterinary care however this was dated from 2013 and did not reflect the most current vaccination
schedule being performed by the licensee at the facility. The program of veterinary care must accurately reflect
current practices at the facility and must be updated regularly including being signed and dated by the attending
veterinarian.
