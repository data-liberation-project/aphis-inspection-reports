3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Three hoof stock enclosures were in disrepair.
-The fence separating the bison and zebu was damaged. The wire fencing was bowed into the zebu enclosure and
several boards were broken. The center board of one section of fencing was missing. The woven wire fence in that
location was severely bowed and there was a gap between the top of the wire and top board.
-The mouflon shelter was damaged. A long screw was protruding from a broken board along one side of the shelter
and a broken board with a protruding screw head was on the ground inside the shelter.
Damaged fencing and sharp objects may injure the animals. Enclosures should be routinely monitored for defects
and repairs should be made in a timely manner.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
