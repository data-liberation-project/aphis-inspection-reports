FEEDING.
The food receptacles inside the enclosure for 2 pigs and 2 sheep have an excessive buildup of dried food on the
surface of the inside bottom. Supervisor stated they are cleaning the food receptacles once a week. Food
receptacles that are not clean and sanitized can lead to disease transmission and decreased appetite. Ensure that
all food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times.
