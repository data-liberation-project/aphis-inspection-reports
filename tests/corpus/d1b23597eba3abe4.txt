2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
During inspection, a large number of patrons were seen walking around the large central circular pen and the two side
rectangular pens. The patrons were reaching in to feed and pet the animals contained within the pens. The three
employees present were sitting at the entrance with their backs to the pens, managing admission. Without constant
monitoring from the attendants, the safety of the animals and the safety of the public cannot be assured during periods of
interaction. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee must be present and monitoring every
interaction at all times during periods of public contact. To be corrected by 5/17/2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.

Inspection at the Georgia State Fair, in Hampton, Georgia. Inspectors observed the public feeding and petting the
animals.
