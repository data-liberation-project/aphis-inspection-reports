SANITATION.
The facility was generally in need of Housekeeping. Cobwebs were present inside enclosures and notably in the
exhaust vents for the facility. The cobwebs had been present long enough to accumulate significant dust. The dust
may lead to respiratory irritation and disease in the animals. The waste water channel on the back of one enclosure
near the window had a significant accumulation of green algae. This area needs to be cleaned and sanitized to
prevent illness in the animals. Correct these issues by performing good cleaning and sanitizing on a regular
schedule. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals
from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. To be Corrected by: 21 December 2015
An exit briefing was conducted with the Owner.
