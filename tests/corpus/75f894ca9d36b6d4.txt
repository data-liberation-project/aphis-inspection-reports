2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following dogs are in need of veterinarian care:
* One adult gray and white male named Darla ( number 04-1) and one adult blue and white male named Bandit (
number 507) were observed to have an abnormal, goose stepping gait. The licensee stated that both Shih Zue /
Bichon cross dogs were approximately two years in age. When the dogs were observed walking, no bend or flex to
the back legs of both dogs were observed. In addition, the back legs of both dogs would extend straight forward
and outwards when attempting to walk. Each dog would elevate one of their back legs and place no weight on it
when they stopped walking. When resting the elevated back leg would extend forward to an estimated 45 degree
angle and stay that way until they started walking. The licensee stated that both dogs were born with this abnormal
gait from a topical treatment for flea or ticks that the licensee applied to the(cid:25) dams of both dogs. At the time of
inspection, the licensee had not called the attending veterinarian nor had any treatment been provided to either
dogs. Abnormal gaits can be painful causing discomfort when the dog has to place weight on the affected legs. It
can affect the mobility and daily activity of both dogs. The licensee must have both all three animals examined by a
veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented
and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary
care at all times.
***************************************************
* Dry, crusted, matted hair under both eyes of one adult male, white colored Bichon ( tag number 111 ) were
observed. The affected area under both eyes were an estimated 1 inch in diameter. No open wounds or lesions to
the skin under the affected area were observed upon closer examination of the eye area. The licensee stated that
she could not remember when the condition first stated. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had
not been consulted. Dried fluid discharge in the hair coat can be painful and irritating causing discomfort and can
lead to a potential spread of infection.
The licensee must have all three animals examined by a veterinarian and have an appropriate treatment plan
administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.


3.4(b)(2) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* The outdoor housing being provided for two dogs is a pet carrier. The holes along the sides do not restrict the
wind, rain or snow from entering the enclosure. In addition, the outdoor sheltered housing must be large enough to
allow each animal to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner and to turn about freely. An estimated three inch hole
was observed along the vented area of this pet carrier. Pet carriers are not considered to be acceptable permanent
housing for the dogs. The pet carriers intended use is to house animals during transport from the facility to an
ending destination. The licensee shall provide the dogs with adequate housing that will protect the dogs from the
direct rays of the sun and the direct effects of the wind, rain or snow.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* An outdoor enclosure containing one dog did not have shade. The enclosure is located under a group of shade
trees. An open area over the enclosure was not providing shade for the dog at time of inspection. Dogs that have
no access to shade during extreme heat conditions could suffer from temperature related medical issues. In
addition, the dog can not regulate its internal temperature on a routine basis. The licensee must ensure that shade
is provided and mustbe large enough to contain the dog at all times and protect them from the direct rays of the sun.
