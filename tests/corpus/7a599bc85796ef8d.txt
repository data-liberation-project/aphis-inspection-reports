3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In a primary enclosure for the male gorilla the floors and toilets have missing and chipped paint in some areas.
Paint is worn off of window frames and some areas of metal grating and supports. Some repairs have been initiated,
including temporary measures to ensure that the floor is not peeling, and is impervious to moisture. Further repairs
are planned for spring when the weather will facilitate painting.
The fencing between the small and large yards has sections with chipped, peeling, missing paint and rust, such as
on the gate. Also the ceiling above the enclosure in the small yard has peeling paint, and the wood appears to be
deteriorating, and this could allow particles to fall into the enclosure. An estimate for making these repairs has been
obtained from a contractor, and repair planning is in progress.
All surfaces must be maintained and/or replaced on a regular basis. Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces can
impede cleaning, create hazards, and otherwise put the health and well-being of the animals at risk.
