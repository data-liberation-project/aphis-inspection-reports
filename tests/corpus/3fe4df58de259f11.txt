3.53(c)(2)

Primary enclosures.
A female rabbit with a litter weighed between 4.4 to 8.8 pounds and was housed in a primary enclosure that provided 4
square feet of floor space.

Per this Section of the Regulations, a female rabbit with a litter shall be provided a minimum of 5 square feet of floor
space when the female rabbit weighs between 4.4 to 8.8 pounds. The minimal amount of floor space provides sufficient
space for the animal to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.

The Licensee corrected this item during the inspection by moving the female rabbit and her kits to an enclosure that
provided more than 5 square feet of floor space.

In addition the Licensee needs to ensure that from this date forward all female rabbits with a litter are provided the
minimum amount of floor space based on the weight of the female rabbit as described in this Section of the Regulations.
3.56(b)(1)

Sanitation.


Although the primary enclosures for rabbits are being spot cleaned periodically to remove excreta and other debris, the
Licensee stated that the primary enclosures for the rabbits are being sanitized approximately once every 6-8 weeks
instead of at least once every 30 days.

Per this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized at least once every 30 days in one of
the manners provided in Section 3.56 (b)(3). This requirement is for the health and comfort of the animals.

The Licensee needs to ensure that all occupied primary enclosures for rabbits are sanitized at least once every 30 days.
