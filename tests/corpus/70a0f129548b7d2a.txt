ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to
promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed
by the attending veterinarian. The facility now has a black and white ruffed lemur which is housed individually. A
plan needs to be developed, documented and approved by the attending veterinarian for the new lemur.
