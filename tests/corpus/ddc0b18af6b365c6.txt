Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Mini-Golden Doodle (tattoo #28, microchip 0A02561301) has an abnormal condition of the skin. Large hairless
areas are located along both sides of the dog from the shoulders to the hindlegs, as well as across the top of the
shoulders and on the top and sides of the neck. The skin in these areas is reddened and contains small crusty lesions.
The condition of the dog has not been identified and no treatment has been provided.

Female Bulldog (tattoo #34, microchip 7E10334721) has an abnormal condition of the left hind foot. A dark colored
material is coating the hair surrounding the middle toes of the foot. Closer examination revealed a small red growth
between the toes which is exuding a discharge causing the skin and hair in the affected area to be wet. The skin between
these toes is moderately reddened. Documentation revealed this dog was treated for an interdigital cyst on 03-21-22 with
Panalog, but no additional treatment has been provided. The facility's interdigital cyst treatment plan states: "Early -
Panalog and Penicillin (once or twice), Advanced or severe - Panalog daily and Excede (repeat in 3 days if needed)".
Based on the condition of the dog's foot, the additional treatment required by the interdigital cyst treatment plan should
have been provided.

Male Pomeranian (tattoo #2, microchip 0A02563944) has poor dental health. The upper left canine tooth and the upper

and lower cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth are encased in a thick buildup of brown colored tartar. A line of grey
material is located along the gum line of the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth. The gums are moderately
reddened with darker red areas located along the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth. The condition of the
dog's teeth has not been identified and no treatment has been provided.

Abnormal conditions of the skin and poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the animal as well as lead to
further health issues.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above-
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
During the inspection of the Bulldog Building, the inspectors noticed an employee trimming the toenails of several dogs.
The inspectors found at least 1 poodle, 3 pomskys, 2 French bulldogs, 5 ore-peis, 3 Boston terriers, 1 pug and 1 shih tzu
which have toenails that are trimmed too short causing the dogs to bleed. Each of the affected dogs is actively bleeding
and most of them have several bloody toes, and in the case of 2 pomskys all four feet are bloody. Significant amounts of
blood are located in the washdown beneath the enclosures, on the enclosure floors and fencing, and on the walkway
outside of the enclosures. Trimming toenails too short can be extremely painful to the dog. Toenails trimmed to the point
where they bleed creates an open wound which could allow disease causing agents to enter the animal's body potentially
resulting in infection.


Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The licensee must ensure that the toenails are trimmed to
an appropriate length that does not result in bleeding nails and/or pain and discomfort to the animal.
