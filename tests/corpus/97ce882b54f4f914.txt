2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The inventory of animals on hand was incomplete and must contain the license number of the entity from which the
animal was acquired. If the entity is not licensed or registered under the Animal Welfare Act then a complete
address and identification is required from the person whom it was purchased or otherwise acquired. Although
APHIS form 7019 is not mandatory to use, alternate inventory forms must contain all information required in 2.75 (b)
(1) and (i-vii).
Several records examined during inspection were lacking complete information required in 2.75 (b) (1) ii-iv.
Although APHIS forms 7020 are not mandatory to use, alternate forms must contain all information required in 2.75
(b) (1) (i-vii). The vehicle license number and state, and the driver's license if he/she is not registered under the
Animal Welfare Act must be recorded. The full name and address of the buyer/receiver must be recorded in
addition to the city and state.
Acquisition and disposition records are necessary to be able to accurately track animals being used in regulated
activities to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation.
The exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose information
concerning animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his possession or under
his control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The
records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his possession or under his control. All information
found within section 2.75(b)(1) should be recorded, maintained, and made available for inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
2.131(c)(1)HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On or near 19 July 2017 the licensee and a reporter entered an enclosure containing three juvenile tigers. The
tigers were approximately 8-10 months old at this time. The facility made no attempt to exert any direct control over
the tigers, which had free contact with the reporter. Reporters are considered to be members of the public. Tigers
of this age and size are too large and strong to be allowed direct contact with members of the public. The facility
cannot allow members of the public to have physical interaction with big cats once they surpass a safe age or size.
Public (including reporters) should not be allowed inside an enclosure with tigers or other big cats that have "aged
out" of public photo sessions. Appropriate barriers must be present at all times to separate and assure the safety of
both the animals and the public.
Correct from this day forward.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the nursery several electrical outlets and switches did not have protective covers in place. The exposed electrical
wires are a potential source of injury to the baby kangaroo and other baby animals housed in this room that are
allowed to roam free. Facilities should be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. Replace missing electrical cover plates.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
