2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the "Golden Shed" there is a male Golden Retriever (Grizzly, unable to obtain microchip number) that is holding
his right, front leg up off the ground and walking on three legs. The right, front paw appears to be swollen and the
dog was observed placing this paw on the ground but immediately picking it back up. This dog couldn't be caught
for the inspector to have a closer look at the paw. Failure of the dog to bear weight on the leg can be a sign of
injury and pain. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. Diagnosis and treatment plan must be
documented and available to inspector upon request.
