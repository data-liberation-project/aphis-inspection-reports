2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A written program of veterinary care with a current attending veterinarian for the facility has not been completed and kept
up to date. The facility representative stated that their previous attending veterinarian has retired, and the facility is
currently using other veterinarians for the current care of the animals. The written program of veterinary care and regularly
scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian ensures that the facility has a program to follow, and all animals have
adequate veterinary care. Each dealer and exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In
the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written
program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises. The written Program of Veterinary Care in
consultation with the attending veterinarian must be made available for review.
