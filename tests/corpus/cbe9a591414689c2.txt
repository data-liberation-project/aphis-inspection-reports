ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Program of Veterinary Care was not available for review at the time of this inspection. Licensees' with part time
attending veterinarians must have a formal written arrangement with a veterinarian (PVC) that addresses the
preventive care for all regulated species. This is required so that USDA personnel can confirm that the licensee is
working with a knowledgeable veterinarian and is following the recommendations from that veterinarian.
A program of veterinary care needs to be developed by the attending veterinarian that addresses all regulated
species owned/exhibited by this facility .
Topics that should be covered in the PVC include but are not limited to:
*The veterinarian's schedule for visits to the facility.
*Parasite control program specific for each species.
*Vaccination recommendations specific for each species.
*Instructions on necropsies for unexpected deaths.
*Diets appropriate for each species.
*Chronic health issues for any specific animal.
*Any other medical/husbandry recommendations the veterinarian feels necessary for this facility.
*Emergency contact information.
The PVC must be signed and dated by the attending veterinarian. This document must indicate to USDA
representatives that the licensee and the veterinarian have an active working relationship.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. In August of 2013 several of the large cat enclosures at this facility were evaluated for their height and the risk of
escape from these enclosures. All of these enclosures are approximately 10 feet in height with a 3 foot kick in with
open tops. Many of them have 4 x 4 square welded wire as their siding which is easily climbed by young animals.
At that time all enclosures housed older animals, 16 to 20+ years old. Photos, fence height along with kick in
length, and the age of the cats housed in the enclosures were sent to the USDA big cat specialist. Her evaluation
was that the enclosures were "suitable for the existing older tigers. Modification to add additional containment
measures to the enclosures must be made before housing other big cats.
Since Aug 2013 most of the older animals in these enclosures have died with much younger animals being moved
into the enclosures. These enclosure must now have additional containment measures added such as several
strands of hotwire at different levels of the fencing, a vertical extension of the fence to 12 feet with a 3 foot kick in, a
top across the entire enclosure, or some other measure to contribute to the containment of the younger cats.

EMPLOYEES.
This facility currently has no adequately trained employees with experience and knowledge of large cats and bears.
The current person in charge has been at the facility since June 1, 2016. He has a little over 2 years' experience
working at a small zoo with no dangerous animals. The other 3 full time employees consist of one person who has
helped feed at the facility on weekends for a number of years, one person who started working at the facility in Dec
2015 and one person who started working in Feb 2016. None of these 3 had exotic animal experience prior to this
facility. This facility also has an intern training program. A new group of seven interns arrived during the first part of
June 2016.
The current inventory of dangerous animals at this facility consists of 31 bears, 4 cougars, 1 jaguar, 3 lions, and 21
tigers. This situation is extremely dangerous for the employees, the interns, the visiting public and the animals.
For example, the area game warden was visiting the facility on June 5, 2016. He observed several individuals
entering various enclosures with unsecured bears. When I visited the facility on June 9th and observed where this
occurred I observed a single gate into the enclosure, not a double safety gate. Two inexperienced individuals
walked through a single gate with food to feed 7 black bears. Nothing was between them and the bears. If they
would have needed to get out quickly, with only a single gate, there is a good possibility the bears would have come
with them. That event put the keepers, the visiting public, and the bears in an extremely dangerous situation.
This facility needs to hire a full time employee or a consultant with extensive knowledge of big cats and bears to
oversee daily operations and safety protocols.To be corrected by: July 1, 2016
