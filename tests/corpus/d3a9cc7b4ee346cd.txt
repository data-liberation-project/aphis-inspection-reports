3.131(d)

Sanitation.
(d) Pest control. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests
shall be established and maintained.

The bottom edge of the wooden lid on one of the feed storage bins has a 4-inch-long area of damage due to chewing by a
rodent. The second wooden feed storage bin has a quarter sided hole on the top of the bin, adjacent to the lid hinge.
This hole also appears to be chewed by a rodent.

A large hole, approximately 6 inches in diameter, is present at the base of the wooden door that leads into the food
storage shed.

These chewed openings allow access to the stored food subjecting the food to contamination by the rodents that are
causing the damage.

Damaged and chewed areas of the feed bins and the shed door should be repaired to ensure a safe and effective
program for control of mammalian pests is established and maintained to protect food items from possible contamination.
