A llama at the Cider Mill location was wearing a halter which was very tight. The animal's skin was raised on either
side of the halter nose strap and the halter appeared to be imbedded in the llama's skin. The animal was observed
to be rubbing its nose and face on the ground. This situation is causing the animal significant pain and must be
treated. This animal should be evaluated by the attending veterinarian. Veterinary treatment recommendations
must be followed. Diagnosis and treatment records must be made available for review by APHIS.
Arrangements for veterinary evaluation for the llama were made at the time of inspection. An appointment was
made for today.

side of the halter nose strap and the halter appeared to be imbedded in the llama's skin. The animal was observed
to be rubbing its nose and face on the ground. This situation is causing the animal significant pain and must be
treated. The llama had been acquired by the facility the prior week. No one at the facility had noticed that the llama
had this problem. Daily observation of all animals must be conducted and potential health issues need to be
reported to the attending veterinarian. Failure to observe these health issues in a timely manner can lead to
unnecessary pain and suffering for the animals. Observe all animals daily for abnormal conditions. Report potential
health issues to the attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. Both locations have had several rabbits disapear from their enclosures. Records indicate that 34 rabbits have been
delivered to the facility. Current inventory is at about 20 rabbits. Animal caretakers at the North Ave location
acknowledge at least four rabbit escapes. These enclosures needs to be repaired/replaced in order to properly
contain the rabbits to prevent injury and predation. Rabbits must be properly housed to prevent unnecessary
animal suffering caused by predation.
