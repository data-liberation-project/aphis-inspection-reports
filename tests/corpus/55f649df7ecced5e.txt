SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Section 3.128 Space requirements: The capybara is housed in an indoor enclosure without a water receptacle that
is large enough for it to at least submerge its body into water. The capybara has a water dish and a shallow pan
with about 4-6 inches of water where it defecates. Under natural conditions capybara spend a significant portion of
their time in water, compliance with space requirements means there should be both dry and aquatic portions of the
primary enclosure, each which, at a minimum, provide sufficient space to allow each animal therein to make normal
postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. The capybara use to be housed outdoors
with a large tub that it could enter and at least submerge its body and move in the water. Correct by providing the
capybara a water receptacle/pool that is large enough and deep enough for it to submerge its body into the water
and move in the water. Correct by July 7, 2015.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: A role of fencing, a chain link fencing panel, and black tub were left between the
camel enclosure and perimeter fence. These items were removed during the inspection. A wood hutch is stored
outside the perimeter fence. There are tall thick weeds/vegetation growing against the outside of the enclosure
fencing for the four Scottish Highland cattle, 4 sheep and 12 goats. It is difficult to walk through the vegetation to
view the enclosure. The dense vegetation against the enclosure is good cover for pests. The vegetation against
the enclosure fence must be removed to allow access to the enclosure and to deter pests. Clutter must be removed
from animal areas to deter pests and for the safety of the animals. This is a repeat non-compliance that remains
uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
