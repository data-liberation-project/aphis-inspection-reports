OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
A female Rottweiler with five puppies is being kept in an enclosure in the barn. The licensee ran out of space for
the dog and his only option was to house the dog in the barn. The enclosure has concrete walls and flooring. The
concrete has not been sealed and is therefore not impervious to moisture. Surfaces that are not impervious to
moisture does not allow for it to be properly sanitized. The concrete surface areas must be fixed so they are
impervious to moisture. Correct by 10/4/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
