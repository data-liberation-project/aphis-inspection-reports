HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(b)(1) Handling
Discussion with the Manager indicated that the following incident occurred on June 19, 2014. A Program Naturalist
returned to the facility at 1:15 PM from an educational session and transferred the animals from the van into the
animal room. She unfortunatey left an opossum and a rabbit inside their carriers in closed van with an outside
temperature of about 90 degrees F. At 7:30 PM an Animal Care Assistant discovered that these animals were
missing in their respective cages in the room. She went inside the van, found a dead opossum and a very weak
rabbit that survived the ordeal. The rabbit was taken cared at the attending veterinarian's clinic. The death of the
opossum was due to an overheated vehicle that was left closed for almost seven hours. The facility shall ensure
that animal caretakers are adequately trained and attend a regularly scheduled refresher course in animal care and
management to reinforce their training. Animal care in the facility is now managed under a trained employee
pending management action against the former caretaker.
CORRECT BY JULY JULY 3, 2014. SOP on animal care and a regularly scheduled refresher course to be in place
by this date.
Exit interview was conducted with Manager.
