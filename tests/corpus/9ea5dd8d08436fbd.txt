ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 pm on
05-Apr-18.
I arrived at the facility on April 5th 2018 at approximately 1:00 pm. I spoke with the licensee and was informed that
that all authorized personnel had a previously scheduled appointment and could not conduct an inspection at that
time. I discussed optimal hours with the licensee and left the facility.
