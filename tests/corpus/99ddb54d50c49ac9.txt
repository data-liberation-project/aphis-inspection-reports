INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved animal care and use protocols for covered
species were changed in late 2016 to require the animals to be weighed prior to bleeding. This change was made
in order to ensure that the amount of blood drawn from the animals does not exceed the protocol guidelines, yet the
facility only started recording weights in June, 2017 for animals on the rabbit protocol.
Failure to weigh the animals to determine the appropriate maximum blood draw volume constitutes an unapproved
significant change to the approved protocol. A system should be in place to ensure that proposed significant
changes to activities involving the care and use of animals are reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to their
implementation.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
2.32(b)
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
There are no training records documenting instruction or capabilities of any of the staff members of the research
facility, and in particular for the animal care staff. Facility representatives stated that their staff received training as
outlined in the protocols and SOP's, but there is no documentation of the training.
The animal care staff has no documented training regarding identifying conditions that may affect the health of the
animals. Examples observed during the inspection included rabbits with long toenails, one rabbit with lesions
consistent with an ear mite infection, and overgrown and cracked hooves in goats; all conditions which have the
potential to adversely affect the welfare of the animals. There is no documentation of training to recognize when an
animal has significant weight loss, such as for animal 8735, which was euthanized at a Body Condition Score of 1
on April 28, 2017. The animal was last handled by staff on April 18, 2017. There is also no documentation of training
for animal care staff regarding wound care following routine blood collection to ensure that animals have stopped
bleeding. Several rabbits were observed with excessive amounts dried blood on their ears and/or backs.It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians,
and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties. Training and
instruction must be made available, and the qualifications of personnel reviewed, with sufficient frequency to fulfill
the research facilities responsibilities.

2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Two goats were observed to have overgrown hooves and three rabbits were observed to have overgrown nails. The
goat hooves were misshapen and cracks were observed on the outer wall of one of the goat hooves.
Excessively long and misshapen hooves and nails are susceptible to breaking and cracking and also place
abnormal stresses on joints and tendons. Cracks in hoof walls may make animals more susceptible to infections.
The facility should ensure that staff members are monitoring the animals so that routine hoof and nail care may be
provided when appropriate.

2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Several rabbits had medical issues that have not been appropriately monitored through daily observation or
communicated to the veterinarian for appropriate treatment in a timely manner.
During inspection, a rabbit appeared to have an ear mite infestation that the facility has not identified or treated.
Another rabbit has an ongoing malocclusion, and the teeth are overgrown with no records of when the teeth were
last trimmed.
Upon review of records, rabbit 8735 was euthanized by the veterinarian on April 28th, 2017. The medical records
from April 28th, 2017 documented that rabbit 8735 had hemiparesis of the hindlegs and was "unable to reach food"
and "has lost a great deal of weight" with a body condition score of about 1. This animal had undergone a blood
collection procedure on 18 April, 2017 and the animal was not weighed and there was no documentation of any
observation of weight loss or communication to the attending veterinarian until April 28th, 2017.
Daily observation of all animals to assess their well-being, appropriate documentation of those observations, and
direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health issues are necessary to ensure
that the animals at the facility receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system should be in place to ensurethat all animals are observed daily, any health problems are documented, and the attending veterinarian is notified
when necessary.
Correct from this date forward.
2.33(b)(5)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Adequate post-procedural care was not provided for several rabbits used under the rabbit protocol. During
inspection, multiple rabbits had dried blood covering the back of the ears or staining the fur on their backs following
blood collection. Dried blood can attract flies and cause skin irritation. Failure to control bleeding may also result in
excessive blood loss.
Failure to ensure adequate hemostasis after blood collection and adhere to current established veterinary medical
procedures may cause the animals unnecessary discomfort and pain. The facility should ensure that adequate
post-procedural care is provided to all animals used in activities regulated by the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct from this day forward
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
In the hoof stock feed barn, there was contamination of both the hay and the pelleted feed. An area of mold was
observed on one bale of straw that was directly adjacent to hay that was meant to be fed to hoof stock. The
pelleted feed had evidence of rodent feces on the bag, and one bag of feed was chewed open with rodent feces
present in the bag of feed. The rodent feces appeared to be from rats, based on the size.
Contamination of animal feed can result in disease transmission and potentially impact the health of the animals.
There should be a system in place to ensure that the food shall be wholesome and free from contamination.
Correction date: 5 July, 2017
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
In the small sheep and the small llama enclosure, the flies were not controlled. Flies were observed on and around
several llamas and the animals were observed shaking their heads repeatedly to dislodge the flies. The flies were
particularly bad in areas of damp hay on the ground in two hoof stock enclosures where they were observed
clustered in and moving on the damp hay. An adhesive fly control string had been placed above one animal
enclosure, however the string had not been maintained and was coated with flies and thus was ineffective at thetime of the inspection.
Rodent feces (appeared to be from rats) were observed on top of and in the pelleted feed bags in the hoofstock
feed barn. There was a bag of pelleted feed that had been chewed open and there were rodent feces
contaminating the feed.
Flies and rodents can transmit disease and flies can be irritating to the animals. The facility must establish and
maintain an effective method of pest control.
