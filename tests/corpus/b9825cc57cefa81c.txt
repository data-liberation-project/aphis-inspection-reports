2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On 28 April 2020, 15 turkey poults hatched. Six of these had splayed legs and were treated as per the SOP and then
separated from the others. Poults from the original 15 continued to die as follows:
29 April - two poults died
30 April - one poult died
2 May - five poults died
3 May - three poults died.
From 28 April to 3 May, the veterinary staff and/or the PI were not notified of the deaths. On 4 May 2020, two poults were
found dead. At this points, the PI (who is also the AV) was notified of the deaths and the remaining two poults were
euthanized.
Failure to communicate daily observations of medical problems and deaths to the attending veterinarian can result in
unaddressed medical concerns and prolonged suffering of the animals. The facility must ensure that there is a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health,
behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Corrected by staff re-training as of 20 May 2020.
