3.80(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
Three sharp points were protruding into the indoor lemur enclosure, containing a breeding pair of lemurs. The wire metal
mesh had a broken wire above the water bottle that was protruding into the enclosure and accessible to the lemurs.
Additionally, where the metal mesh meets the wood at the floor of the enclosure, 2 pieces of wire were bent up and
protruding into the enclosure, accessible to the animals. Sharp points can injure animals as they move about their
enclosure. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could
injure the primates. Correct by 10/23/22
3.129(b)

Feeding.
The feed pan in the sugar glider enclosure had significant build-up of caked food and filth. The old, crusted food was
approximately half an inch thick across nearly 100% of the feed pan. The licensee stated that he cleans the pan about 3
times a year and just puts new food on top of the the old food. When old food and filth is allowed to build-up in feeders, it
can attract pests and disease-causing organisms. Feeders must be kept in a clean and sanitary manner and measures
must be taken to prevent caking, contamination, and deterioration of food. Correct by cleaning before next feeding.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
