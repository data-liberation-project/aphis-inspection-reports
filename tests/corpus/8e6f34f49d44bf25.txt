Housing facilities, general.
The capuchin had pulled up two 1' x 2' areas of the linoleum covering the floor. The pulled-up flooring exposed the
wooden subfloor below and posed an ingestion risk to the animal. Ingestion of foreign objects could be detrimental to the
health of the animal. Per the regulations, housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so
that they are structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair,
and they must protect the animals from injury. Correct by 17August2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
