3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the sheltered housing building containing mothers and puppies, the outdoor runs contain a drainage system
consisting of a hollow drain pipe covered by metal grating. These pipes are located below the entrances to the
interior sheltered areas. In two of the runs, there are gaps present in the metal grating that could potentially lead to
injury or entrapment of the animals. The licensee must eliminate these gaps by replacing or repairing the grating,
and must maintain these structures to ensure the health and welfare of the regulated animals.
