3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At least 5 enclosures in the whelping area housing 11 dogs have worn and chewed wood surfaces as well as
chewed and worn plastic wall panels. In one of the outdoor pens housing 4 dogs, the 6 by 8 foot dog shelter had
one side panel ripped upward from the structure along the bottom allowing dogs to squeeze through the opening
and exit the shelter. Surfaces that are not maintained cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris and other disease hazards. Surfaces not in good repair can fail to protect animals from
the elements and cause injury to them.
Surfaces of housing facilities and enclosures must be maintained and repaired or replaced when worn and unable
to be properly cleaned and sanitized.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an excessive buildup of thick dark brown to black layer of dirt, grime and debris on most of the inside
plastic wall panel surfaces of at least 6 enclosures housing at least 12 dogs in the whelping area. There were
cobwebs with spiders located on and within may enclosures. An excessive number of flies were present on the dirty
walls and wet bedding within the enclosures.
Water buckets for the adults, and puppy water receptacles in 5 pens housing 8 dogs were dirty. Open water
buckets contained sawdust bedding and there was a thick build-up of dark black to dark brown dirt, grime, hair, etc
on the rim of many of the water buckets. Plastic puppy water receptacles had a layer of grime in the bowl and a
layer of orange-ish brown film visible on the inside of the tank. The licensee agreed that the water receptacles often
developed a layer of film on the inside as time passes. The metal feeders also had a buildup of dark brown to black
grime. Licensee says they clean them out as needed. Failure to properly clean and sanitize water receptacles can lead to disease hazards that can affect the health and
well being of the dogs. All food water receptacles and primary enclosures being used must be sanitized at least
once every two weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and
other disease hazards.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the outdoor housing area,10 pens containing 49 dogs contained overgrown weeds. The majority of weeds were
very tall, at least 3 feet high, dense and covered at least half of the pen area. Weeds can obscure vermin and holes
that the dogs could fall into and they can also harbor external parasites that carry disease. Weeds and grasses
must be controlled to facilitate pest control and to protect the health and well being of the animals.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the whelping area, containing 53 adult dogs and puppies, there were excessive number of flies present. The
licensee indicated that they do not have a plan for fly control and no fly strips were present. Cobwebs were present,
filled with spiders and numerous flies, both inside and outside of the enclosures. In the whelping area, evidence of
mouse holes were present at the front of the enclosures that lead into the enclosures. The licensee states they
periodically use rat bait to control the mice and rats in this area but they were not currently using any method of
vermin control. In the outdoor housing areas, near the shelters and underneath the small door used to refill the
feeders inside the shelters, there were numerous vermin holes with rodent feces in the ground under these feeders.
Pests and vermin can harbor and spread diseases and must be controlled for the health and well being of the
animals.
The licensee must have an effective program for the control of insects, and external parasites affecting dogs. The
program needs to be maintained so as to promote the health and well being of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in animal areas.
