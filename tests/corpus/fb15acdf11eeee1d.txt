SANITATION.
*** Numerous rodent holes were found outside of the tiger and leopard enclosures. These holes were of various
age with some having fresh dirt around them while other appeared older. The licensee stated that they use smoke
bombs as a rodent control procedure. Additional measures must be instituted to ensure the rodent problem is
corrected. Rodents are harbors of disease and may carry disease to the animals at the facility. Correct this by
instituting an effective rodent control program.
