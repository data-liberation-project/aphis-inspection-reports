WATERING.
A metal water receptacle in a mink enclosure had a moderate buildup of rust and contained dirty, brownish colored
water with an accumulation of plant material floating on the surface. The presence of rust can prevent the required
cleaning and sanitizing. Additionally, in another mink enclosure there was a metal water receptacle with a heavy
accumulation of greenish algae coating the inside walls and bottom surface.
All water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the animals are
provided with clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain adequate
hydration. Water receptacles must be cleaned or replaced as needed at a frequency that is adequate to maintain
standard husbandry practices.
