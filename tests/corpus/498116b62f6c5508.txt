2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two of the 8 random dogs that were inspected (Wendy & Trivis) has accumulations of hard tarter encasing some of
the pre molars/molars making it difficult to visualize the normal shape of the entire tooth.
These large amounts of tartar can (and do) progress to gum disease, bad breath, heart problems, kidney disease,
pain in the gums/mouth, and difficulty in eating & chewing if left untreated.
The licensee is currently offering all of the dogs dental chews in an effort to control the tarter buildups, but this does
not appear to be entirely effective for, at least, these two dogs.
There were also 2 unopened boxes of Heartguard Blue that expired in April 1015. The licensee has other
medications for the prevention of heartworms, and these two boxes were disposed of immediately.
Not removing the build up of large amounts of tarter on teeth, and using expired medications are not appropriate
methods to control, prevent, and treat diseases.
Have your veterinarian examine all of your dogs teeth and gums and treat accordingly.
