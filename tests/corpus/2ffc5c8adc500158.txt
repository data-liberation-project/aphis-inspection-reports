2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
During a procedure on 9 January 2014 under the approved protocol A1011, an anesthetized rhesus macaque was
injured by the use of overheated fluid bags for thermal support during an imaging procedure. This resulted in
thermal burns to two areas on the macaque's legs and evidence of behavioral stress during healing. The rhesus
macaque was observed during this inspection and has fully recovered from this incident.
Failing to handle animals in a careful manner can cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Ensure
that all employees are trained and practice careful and acceptable handling procedures on animals during all
activities. The facility has already implemented corrective measures as a result of this incident, which include a
revised training program for laboratory members handling animals and the addition of a veterinary technician/animal
technologist present for all animals undergoing anesthetic procedures.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.
