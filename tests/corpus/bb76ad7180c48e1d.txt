2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* There was no record of inventory present on "unweaned" puppies born at the facility. No inventory information
was attached to ten enclosures containing seven "unweaned" puppies. If any puppy born on the premise has been
recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the enclosure must have the following information attached to it:
dealer's USDA license number, the letters (cid:28) USDA (cid:28) and the number identifying each puppy in that litter. If no
offspring have been recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the following information must be recorded and
attached to the enclosure. The dealer's USDA number, the number identifying each puppy, the date of birth of the
litter, the dam's ID number, a description of each puppy ( breed, sex, color and any distinctive markings ). The
inventory information records must be maintained with all corresponding 7006's for one year. If the licensee
chooses to identify the "unweaned" puppies with official USDA identification ( collar, tattoo or microchip ), then no
inventory information is required on the enclosure. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure that
every puppy's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace all puppies. The licensee must
maintain complete and accurate records of all puppies at all times at their facility. Correct by 2/28/15.
3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Excessive rust was observed along the bottom of one enclosure gate and on the galvanized fencing located
below. Two dogs are in contact with the affected area located in outdoor housing. The enclosure gate and panel
had a roughened surface and appeared to be flaking. Rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces to the point
that the metal surfaces can no longer be readily cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust affects the structural
integrity of all metal surfaces. Licensee must ensure that this and all other surfaces are free of rust and of good
structural strength. Correct by 2/28/15.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of cobwebs, dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on the fiberglass wall boards in eight
enclosures and six metal entryway doors. Fourteen dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in shelter
housing. The affected area covers approximately 25 to 40 percent of the fiberglass wall boards and 50 to 75percent of the metal entryway doors.. Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta
and other disease hazards. It indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or
health risks. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with
section 3.11 (b).
* The facility inspection done on 1/28/15 and the exit briefing done on 1/29/15 were conducted with the licensee.
