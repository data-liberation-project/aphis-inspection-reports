3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
In barn 7, multiple cages were in need of repair with sharp points protruding into the primary enclosures and large holes in
cage walls. Between cages 43 and 44, a hole in the cage wall allowed for 3 week old kits to enter the cage of a rabbit that
was not their mother. Between cages 32 and 33, there was a hole between the cages large enough for the adult rabbits to
stick their head into the cage of another rabbit. In Cages 19 and 20, broken wires in the front of the cages created holes
big enough for the 3 week old kits in the cages to potentially escape. In cages 78 and 90, large broken wires over the
feeders created a hazard to the rabbits' eyes whenever they ate from the feeders. Multiple other cages, including 39, 47,
52, 57, 83, 84, and 168, had broken wires, creating sharp point hazards in the cages, holes of various sizes, and
weakened flooring. When cages are not maintained in good repair, rabbits can become injured or escape. Correct by
ensuring the cages are kept in good repair to keep the rabbits safe and contained. Multiple issues were corrected at the
time of inspection. Correct remaining issues by 10/31/22

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
