ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1300 on
28-Dec-16. Veterinary Medical Officer Dr. Sime and I went to the licensee's house. I knocked on the door and no
one answered. I then honked my car horn. I attempted to contact the licensee by phone and left messages on two
different phone numbers. Dr. Sime and I saw someone working on farmyard equipment in the back part of the
property. I attempted to get the person's attention by honking my car horn numerous times and waving at him/her. I
again attempted to contact the licensee by phone. After an hour of not being able to get the attention of the person
in back part of the farm, we left the property.
The licensee contacted me by phone later on in the day. He mentioned that he was the one working in the back part
of the farm and he did not hear his phone ring. He gave me his optimal hours for inspection. I informed him I would
try to catch him another time.
End of report.
