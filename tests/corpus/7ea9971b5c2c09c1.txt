2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Persian kitten (Y-021) had a buildup of fecal matter caked on its rear end. After the inspectors pointed this out,
the licensee immediately took the kitten to the sink and washed the kitten's hind end. After the fecal material was
removed by the licensee, inspectors noticed the kitten's anal area was reddened and inflamed. This inflamed area
could indicate infection or other veterinary medical condition which could be painful. The licensee must consult with
a licensed veterinarian regarding this animal's condition in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and to ensure that
an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
