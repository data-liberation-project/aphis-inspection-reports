fallen off the wooden support board. The goats may catch their collars on or become entrapped on these items .

The recently acquired young pig named Charlotte was observed to be shivering at time of the inspection . She is
housed in an enclosure with a large umbrella that provides shade and does have hay bedding to burrow into but this
does not provide adequate shelter from predicted cold and wet weather.
There are 2 shelters available to the 3 llamas housed with the goats behind the house but these shelters are not tall
or large enough to accomodate 3 llamas. Adequate shelter from inclement weather must be provided to Charlotte
and to the 3 llamas to afford them protection and prevent discomfort. CORRECT BY : 11-25-15
