FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of the inspection (mid day/full sun), there was limited shade available outside the shelter in the enclosure
housing the five wolfdogs (Azteca #179; Katrina #177; Saint #176; Juno #178; Goldie #180). One animal in this
enclosure was noted laying down in the small amount of shade available in the corner of the pen. Insufficient shade
during the summer can cause overheating and discomfort to the animals. Additional shade must be provided to the
five animals housed in this enclosure to protect them from direct sunlight. To be corrected by: July 8, 2016.
Shade is also an issue in the enclosure housing the 4 dingos (Aussie #214; Glacier #215; Kooyong #216; Uluru
#213)
At the time of the inspection (mid-day), there was only a small amount of shade in one corner of their enclosure.
One

shade
during the summer can cause overheating and discomfort to the animals. Additional shade must be provided to the

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is one plastic igloo shelter in the primary enclosure for two wolfdogs (Nakota #154; Silva #193). The igloo is
not large enough to comfortably house both animals. Insufficient protection from inclement weather can cause
discomfort to animals housed outdoors. All animals kept outdoors must be provided adequate shelter to
protect them and to prevent discomfort. To be corrected by: July 8, 2016.
