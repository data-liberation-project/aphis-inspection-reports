FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several outdoor enclosures at the facility had fencing that was in need of repair or replacement.
**E5 housing 3 female elk had a bent support post on the east side of the fencing that was no longer structurally
sound for these animals. Numerous sections of the woven wire fencing were bowing and had large gaps between
the horizontal panels, posing a risk for structural strength of these sections as well as possible injury of the animals.
The north side of the fencing had several areas where there were sharp points due to broken welded wire fencing
and wires used to secure the wire panels to the posts, posing a risk of injury to these animals.
**E2 housing 2 male Bighorn sheep has most of the north side and west side fencing in disrepair where the woven
wire is bent and weakened, posing a risk for the structural strength of the fencing. Several broken wires with sharp
ends protruding into the enclosure were also noted on the north side fencing, posing a risk of injury to the animals.
**The fencing that separates E1 housing 4 male Bighorn sheep and D1 housing 5 female elk was in disrepair. A
wooden support post was worn thin and several metal posts were bent or leaning, posing a risk for the structural
strength of the fencing for these animals. Numerous broken wires with sharp ends protruding into these two
enclosures were noted all along this fenceline, posing a risk of injury to the animals.
**The "catch area" in E1 for the 4 male Bighorn sheep had welded wire attached to cattle panels that has become
unsecured in several places and poses a risk for injury for these animals.
Outdoor housing facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals
involved and shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals. A reduction in personnel and resources at the facility have affected the ongoing
maintenance at the facility. Any animals which can be moved into enclosures that are structurally sound and in good
repair until more extensive repair or replacement of fencing can occur should be moved.
