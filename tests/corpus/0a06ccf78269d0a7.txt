ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the "Basement" there is a female Pomeranian (ID# 100) with a round, raised area protruding from the skin under
her left eye. The protrusion is mostly hairless and moderately reddened and was slightly firm when felt by hand.
There is some dark staining of the hair between the eye and the protrusion and along the front of the protrusion.
Skin protrusions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The diagnosis and
treatment plan must be documented and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all
dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The licensee was verbally told to have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by Friday, February 05.
Correction date: End of business February 05, 2016
In the "Basement" there is a female Rat Terrier (no ID) with excessively overgrown toenails on all four feet. Closer
observation of the toenails revealed that they have developed a severe curve and have become so long that they
lay sideways from the toes when the dog stands on the concrete floor. Excessively long toenails can cause pain
and discomfort to the dog as well as affect the animal's natural gait. The licensee must trim this dog's toenails and
must ensure that the toenails of all dogs are kept at an acceptable length at all times.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Basement" the sides of the enclosures are constructed with either chain link or wire. There is one enclosure,
containing two dogs, whose chain link has broken into sharp points at the level of the dogs. There are four
enclosures, containing six dogs, whose wire sides have broken into large holes, gaps and sharp points. The gapsand holes occur where the wire sides meet the enclosure floor and are large enough for a dog's leg or foot to pass
through. All the sharp points from the broken wires are located at the level of the dogs and surround the holes and
gaps. Sharp points and holes and gaps in the enclosure sides can cause injury to the dogs.
Housing facilities for dogs must be constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in good
repair and protect the dogs from injury. The licensee must repair, replace or alter the damaged chain link and wire
enclosure sides in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the dogs. The licensee must also ensure that all
enclosures are kept in good repair and remain safe for the dogs at all times.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Basement" there is one enclosure, containing two Rat Terriers, that has an excessive amount of feces
scattered around the floor space. Some of the feces have been stepped on and flattened by the dogs as they run
around the enclosure. The licensee stated that the feces are not removed from the enclosure daily.
In another enclosure, containing one adult Pomeranian and two puppies, there is a large amount of feces impacted
into the wire flooring. The floor of the enclosure is made up of multiply layers of offset wire and the feces have
become trapped in between the layers and the adult dog has smashed and flattened the feces in the area where
she sits on the top layer of wire. The licensee said that she uses a wire brush to try and get the feces to fall
through the layers of flooring. Excessive accumulation of feces can increase the risk of disease hazards towards
the dogs.
Surfaces with which the dogs come in contact with must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two
weeks or as often as necessary, to prevent the accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. The licensee
must remove the feces from all enclosures on a daily basis in order to promote the health and well-being of the
dogs.
