Veterinary care for dogs.
At the time of inspection, records indicated that not all the dogs were receiving a complete physical exam at least once
every 12 months by the attending veterinarian. Physical exams are a form of ensuring the health and well-being of the
animals, and if not performed, could lead to missed and untreated illnesses/conditions. A complete physical exam from
head to tail of each dog must be performed by the attending veterinarian not less than once every 12 months.
