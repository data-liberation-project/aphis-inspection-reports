INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
A ruffed lemur is being housed in the main room of the barn, with a capuchin housed in a small adjoining room. The
lemur had a shelter with a heating pad, and was being provided external heat from two portable heat lamps directed
at the shelter area. The remainder of the enclosure did not have any supplemental heat. The ambient temperature
was checked between the enclosure wall and the heat lamps, and recorded at 31.9 F.
The capuchin was housed in a room with several cages of parrots. Heat was provided by a single portable heater.
The ambient temperature was measured at 39 F.
Excessive cold can have serious health consequences. Nonhuman primates in indoor housing facilities must be
maintained at a minimum of 45 F to help protect their health and welfare.

3.76(c)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
- In the barn, a ruffed lemur and a capuchin are being kept in separate rooms. The ruffed lemur is housed in the
main barn area, while the capuchin is in a separate room. Neither room has adequate lighting. In the main barn
area, the overhead lights would not work during the inspection, while the room with the capuchin had only a single
light bulb which was not sufficient. Inadequate lighting can be stressful to the enclosed animals, and could result in
negative physical or emotional health. Primates housed in indoor enclosures must be provided a diurnal light cycle,
and the light must be uniformly diffused throughout the facility. The licensee must provide adequate lighting and
ensure normal day/night cycles of lighting are provided.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
- Nonhuman primates are being held in five sheltered enclosures throughout the facility. Three of the five did not
have adequate heating for the shelters. Enclosure H1 housing three ringtailed lemurs was being provided heat by two portable heaters. The ambient
temperature was measured at 32 F. The temperature of the shelter ground was measured at 40 F, and the back
wall measured at 30 F.
Enclosure F4 housing two ringtailed lemurs was provided heat by a heating pad and a light. The ambient
temperature was 22 F. The indoor/outdoor access door was open when inspectors first arrived at this enclosure.
Enclosure F2 housing 2 ringtailed lemurs did not have an actual heat lamp in place. The ambient temperature of
the shelter was measured at 23.6 F, and the temperature of the back wall next to the light was measured at 29 F.
There was a heating pad in place within the shelter.
Excessive cold can lead to severe health problems for the enclosed animals. Primates housed in sheltered facilities
must have the ambient temperature kept above 45F.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Section 3.81(a) - Social grouping.
(cid:9)
***** There were six enclosures with only one animal present in each: one black-handed spider monkey, one white
throated capuchin, two black and white ruffed lemurs, and two ring tail lemurs. There was no documentation that
addressed the individually housed nonhuman primates. If these animals are not compatible with others, this must
be noted and approved by the attending veterinarian. The individually housed ring tailed lemurs can see other
nonhuman primates and are separated by wire dividers. The individually housed spider monkey, capuchin and the
two ruffed lemurs cannot see other nonhuman primates. The environment enhancement plan must include specific
provisions to address the social needs of nonhuman primates of species known to exist in social groups in nature.
Such specific provisions must be in accordance with currently accepted professional standards, as cited in
appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.
This affects six animals.

Section 3.81(b) - Environmental enrichment.
***** The environmental enrichment provided to the nonhuman primates is not adequate. The current enrichment
plan is a generic document covering all primates that does not take into account any other variables. There is no
plan denoting specific enrichment, no log book or calendar showing that enrichment takes place, and no schedule
for rotating or changing the items in the pens. Multiple enclosures did not have enrichment items in their
enclosures. An adequate enrichment plan must be developed which addresses the needs of each separate species
of primate, and the plan must be followed. This affects 16 animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- The building numbered F7 housing the black and white ruffed lemur and the oriental small-clawed otter had an
excessive accumulation of rodent feces present on the floor concentrated along the walls and the corners of the
enclosure. The licensee stated that 2 mice were caught on Sunday but the traps had not been replaced in the
external hallway. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote
the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. All rodent excreta
must be removed as needed and an effective program initiated to control the pests.
This affected 2 animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(3.125)(a) Structural strength.
*****The wire fencing and posts for the kangaroo enclosure (2 animals) are loose. The pen has an area where the
entire fence is leaning outward along with the wooden post. Loose fencing can lead to harming of the animals,
escaping or allow other animals entering the pen.
*****There is a shredded wooden support post in the tiger enclosure(1 animal) with sharp points. This is a potential
source of injury to the enclosed animal. This area needs to be repaired or replaced to help protect the health and
welfare of the animal.
***** The camel shelter is missing a panel, and has a large hole in one of the front panels. This poses a risk of
injury to the animal, and also greatly reduces the effectiveness of the shelter itself. All parts of the housing facilities must be in good repair. These structures need to be replaced or repaired.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
A single chinchilla was being held in a cage inside the education center. There was an excessive accumulation of
feces throughout the cage. This causes increased contamination to the enclosed animal, and a risk of illness.
Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to maintain good husbandry and help protect the health of the
enclosed animal.
