INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
One protocol is lacking a complete written narrative of the methods and sources used by the principle investigator to
demonstrate that they have considered alternatives to the painful procedures in the animal use protocol. It is
essential that this complete information be included in order for the IACUC to determine that the animals are being
used in a humane and judicious manner.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Two protocols did not contain written assurance from the principle investigator that the procedures included in the
protocol do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments. The facility uses a written assurance statement
which is attested to by the PI when they sign the protocol. These protocols have not been signed by the PI. This
information must be completed in order for the IACUC to be assured that the animals are being used in a humane
and judicious manner.
