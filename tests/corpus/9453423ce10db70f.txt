3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor pens housing the golden retrievers are in need of spot cleaning and raking to remove fecal material
which has collected over the last three days on the gravel flooring. The accumulation is leading to odors noted
outside the enclosures and is such that the animals cannot avoid contact with it while running in the enclosures.
Excess accumulations of excreta create a disease hazard risk and can lead to contamination of the dogs and
unpleasant odors. The floors of the outdoor pens need to be spot cleaned more often to ensure that all animals
have the freedom to avoid contact with the excreta and to eliminate odors. Correct by end of day on 7/26/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owners.
