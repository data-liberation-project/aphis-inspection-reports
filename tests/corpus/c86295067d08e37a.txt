ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 100pm on
05/20/2014.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the front door and waited in the driveway for 40 minutes. I then went down
the road to the licensees' last known mothers residence, however no one was home to make contact. I was unable
to make contact via phone at this time.
