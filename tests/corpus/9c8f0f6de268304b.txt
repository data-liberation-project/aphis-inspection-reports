Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 am on Friday,
November 18, 2022. I spoke with one licensee, who was sick. I left voicemail messages for the other licensee, who did
not return my calls. I left my contact information at the facility, side door of the house.
