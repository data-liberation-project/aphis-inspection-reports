2.126(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 10:50am on 08/11/2016.
Upon arrival, I knocked on the door and Ms. Leo came to the doorway and when I said "Hi Carrie, we're here and
need to do an inspection today." Ms. Leo promptly stated " No, you need to go" and proceeded to turn away from
us and shut the door.
Repeated refusal to allow APHIS officials to enter a facility in order to inspect regulated species and other
potentially regulated animals is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Access must be granted to any
facilities as deemed necessary by APHIS officials in order to enforce the provisions of the AWA regulations and
standards, including but not limited to animal housing areas, procedure areas, transportation conveyances, holding
areas, or other auxiliary areas related to the care or use of regulated species. In addition records may be examined
and copied as needed and photographs taken of the facilities and animals as APHIS officials consider necessary.
ACI Andrea D'Ambrosio and C.S. Cynthia Neis were present at the time of this refused inspection.
