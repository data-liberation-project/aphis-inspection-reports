2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
The facility self reported to USDA that on 10/8/20, following a standard monthly colony catch for semi-annual health
exams and room cleaning, it was discovered, at the time that the bats were being released back into the colony
enclosure, that one bat had sustained a serious injury and was no longer able to fly. The bat received immediate,
appropriate veterinary care. The facility personnel were unable to determine how the injury had occurred between the
time of the health exam, and the attempted release back into the colony enclosure.

All animals must be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible so as not to cause any harm. The facility should
review all handling procedures, equipment, and personnel training in order to prevent any further handling injury incidents.

To be corrected from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
