INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) conducted a review of the program for humane care and
use of animals and the inspection of animal facilities in March, 2017; however the reports of its evaluations were not
submitted to the Institutional Official of the research facility.
The IACUC, with respect to activities involving animals and as an agent of the research facility, must perform the
function of preparing its semiannual evaluations and then submitting them to the Institutional Official in a timely
manner to keep the Institutional Official adequately informed and to comply with the regulatory requirements. The
IACUC report of its March, 2017 evaluations must be submitted to the Institutional Official, and all future reports
shall be approved and submitted in a timely manner.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved rabbit study required 50 ml bleeds 4 days apart (on study days 73 & 77), which is not approved
in the SOP for rabbit blood collection. The IACUC did not adequately review animal activities being performed
under this study, to ensure that the study is performed according to the approved SOP.
Adequate IACUC review of animal use is necessary to ensure that activities involving animals are being conducted
in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. The IACUC should make certain that all activities relating to the care
and use of animals receive adequate oversight.
Correction date: 8 September, 2017
2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).Covered animal standard operating procedures inspected were not reviewed by IACUC for the last one to two
years. There is no documentation on file that the SOP's approved on 9/12/15 (Goat Immunization & blood
collection), 1/1/16 (Rabbit immunization) or 4/27/16 (Llama immunization and blood collection) have been reviewed
by the IACUC since those dates. Annual review of animal activities shall be done to record ongoing updates and
other modifications that may be necessary for the completion of the study. Facility shall ensure that reviews are
appropriately done as determined by the IACUC, but not less than annually.
Correction date 8 September, 2017

ANNUAL REPORT.
The Annual Report submitted for this facility reported all animals at the facility in column B, which was incorrect
because a majority of the animals are currently on project and should have been reported in column C or D.
Properly identifying animals used in research on the annual report is necessary to inform the Institutional Official
and the Animal Care Regional Office of the scope and extent of the animal use at the facility. The 2016 annual
report needs to be amended and resubmitted to the Regional Office with all animal use data correctly reported.
Previous Annual Reports for Fiscal Year 2015 and 2014 should also be corrected by submitting an amendment with
an explanatory letter.
Correction date: 8 September, 2017 and all future Annual reports.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
