3.8(a)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
*** A male terrier #545 that was 22 inches in length was housed in a 3x3 enclosure. This gives the dog 9 square
feet of space which meets the primary enclosure amount needed but does not meet the 2x space required to meet
the exercise requirement. The dog was observed to be circling his enclosure throughout the duration of the
inspection process which can indicate psychological stress or boredom. There was no exercise plan available for
review at the time of the inspection. An exercise plan for the dogs at the facility needs to be developed and
documented and the plan for this dog should encourage exercise through play or other similar activities to reduce
the amount of time circling the pen. This needs to be addressed for the health of the dog.
