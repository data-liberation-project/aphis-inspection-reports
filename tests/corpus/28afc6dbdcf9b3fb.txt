ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:15 AM on
20-Mar-18.
The inspector arrived at 11:15AM on 3/20/18 to conduct an inspection but the Licensee was not on the premises.
The inspector spoke with the Licensee by phone and learned that he/she was at a distant off-site location and would
not be available to accompany the inspector on an inspection until several hours later in the afternoon.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other facility representative available
to accompany the inspector.
Correct from this date forward by providing inspector with hours of availability.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 3/21/18.
