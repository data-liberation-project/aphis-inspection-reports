ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two hedgehogs ('Manitou' and 'Denali') were noticed to have mouths that were swollen and red. Neither hedgehog
could completely close their mouth due to the swelling. This condition could be painful and affect their ability to eat
or drink. This problem had not been reported to the attending veterinarian until noticed during inspection. Any
animal health problem must be reported promptly to the attending veterinarian so that it may be appropriately
addressed. Have the attending veterinarian evaluate and recommend treatment for Denali and Manitou and ensure
that any other health problem is promptly communicated to the attending veterinarian.
