2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
1. At the time of the last inspection the licensee reported to the inspector that he euthanized the animals when
unable to treat them according to SOPs worked out with his Attending Veterinarian (AV), or if adult animals are to
be culled from the breeding program. The method normally used by the licensee is via cervical dislocation in awake
animals. The method of euthanasia in the written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is that the licensee may
euthanize the animals himself and this can be done without consulting the AV for individual animals. Adult
chinchillas at this facility weigh around 20-30 oz.
During today's inspection it was learned that the licensee had tried to contact the AV after the last inspection but he
has not heard back from the AV yet so the method of euthanasia to be used at the facility has still not been
discussed.
Cervical dislocation, when used alone, is not an approved method of humane euthanasia for this species and size
of animals. Generally, it is only recommended for mice, rats weighing <200 g and immature rabbits. The use of an
inappropriate method to euthanize animals may cause the animal additional distress or discomfort.
The licensee must consult with the Attending Veterinarian to determine an appropriate method to euthanize these
animals that meets current standards of veterinary care. The written Program of Veterinary Care needs to be
updated to include a complete description of the method of euthanasia approved by the Attending Veterinarian that
is to be used for all of the animals at the facility.
NOTE - Exit interview held on-site 3/1/16 with Licensee.
