* *A longhair male Dachshund "Opie" (#985112002555721) has a right eye that is cloudy with a thin to thick green
colored discharge. There is crusty dark material along the lower eyelid. His upper back teeth on the right side are
also completely encased in a thick grey- white colored material. The canine teeth also have a build up of brown
material on them. This type of material is on both sides of the mouth, covering the teeth and the gums on both sides
have receded to expose tooth root. The right side of the muzzle below the eye appeared swollen, and there is also a
foul odor coming from his mouth. The licensee had not noticed the eye issues, swelling, nor the foul odor from the
mouth until mentioned by the inspectors. She had not yet scheduled a dental cleaning but had noted the build up on
the teeth. The discharge coating the eye may be indicative of infection, injury or other medical condition. The build
up of material on the teeth and foul odor may be indicative of dental disease or other medical condition. These
conditions can be painful, cause stress, reduce nutrition intake and affect the overall health of the dog. Licensee
must have this dog evaluated by the veterinarian, obtain a diagnosis and treatment plan, retain documentation of
such information and have readily available for review upon request by the inspector.
