ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An authorized facility representative was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process
at 3:45 on 05/12/2016. The licensee's wife was home, but was unable to accompany the inspector due to physical
limitations and unfamiliarity with handling of the animals or records needed to complete the inspection. The
inspector was able to speak with the licensee by phone to obtain travel itinerary for the next several weeks.
