3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The rotted and deteriorated interior wooden support post, just inside of the shelter door opening, still has not been
repaired. This post could still injure the wolf-hybrids upon entering and exiting the shelter building. The rotted wooden
support post should be replaced to keep the building in good repair and to prevent injury.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
