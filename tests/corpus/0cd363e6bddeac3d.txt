This is a focused inspection on the Direct and other NCIs from the inspection on January 28, 2014.
The male Yorkie "Willie" had his right rear molar removed and treated by the veterinarian and has healed well. The
male Yorkie "Poozac" with the ulceration on his left eye was looked at by the veterinarian who advised that the
growth on the eye was now a scar, and not painful to the dog at this time and did not require treatment. The
remaining 3 dogs that need dental care are to be done March 12, 2014 by the veterinarian. All other NCIs from the
previous inspection have been corrected.
