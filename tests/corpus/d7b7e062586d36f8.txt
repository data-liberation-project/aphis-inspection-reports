Sanitation.
The following housekeeping issues were noted during the inspection of the animal facilities. The floor areas in front of
and along one wall in the main barn housing llamas, alpacas, and zebu where the feed storage barrels and shelving unit
are located were cluttered due to the storage of an assortment of tools and other miscellaneous items. The floor and
shelves in the heated building where the two coatimundi and one porcupine are housed were cluttered due to an
assortment of miscellaneous items stored on the floor, shelves, and on top of a feed storage container.

Per this Section, premises (including building and grounds) where there are facilities housing animals shall be kept clean
to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart and to protect the health of the animals. The
presence of clutter in animal housing areas interferes with the ability to effectively keep the premises clean and orderly.
These areas need to be de-cluttered and cleaned. Correct by 3/30/22.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 3/14/22 with the Licensee. *END OF REPORT*
