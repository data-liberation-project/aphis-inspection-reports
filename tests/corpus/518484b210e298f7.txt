3.106(b)(3)

Water quality.
The facility was not maintaining a weekly standard of collecting samples for coliform counts as required in the regulations.
Within the last fiscal year, there were six weeks where coliform testing was not conducted due to a lack of staff availability
or other variables interrupting the schedule. Interruptions in water sampling can hinder the facility's ability to ensure the
water is not detrimental to the health and well-being to the animals. Coliform sampling must be conducted at least once a
week.
Correct prior to the next scheduled relicense inspection.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility's perimeter fence was not in compliance at the time of inspection. There was an accumulation of construction
material piled adjacent to a section of the perimeter fence. This decreased the inner portion of the fence to less than 8ft in
height. Additionally, the facility had added gravel to a path that ran alongside the perimeter fence effectively decreasing
the inner height of the perimeter fence to less than 8ft in height. The accumulation of construction material next to the
perimeter fence and the decreased height overall could allow for animals to climb out of the property. The fence must be
constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going


through it, or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility.
Correct prior to scheduling the next relicense inspection.
