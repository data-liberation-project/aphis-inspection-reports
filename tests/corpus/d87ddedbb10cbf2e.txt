FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A rabbit hutch currently being used to house three rabbits had an approximately 3 inch X 4 inch sized hole in the
wire mesh flooring at the back part of the hutch with exposed sharp, pointed wire ends.
Failure to maintain primary enclosures in good repair can lead to injury to rabbits, including falling through floors,
puncture wounds from wires, and trapping limbs in openings. A system of timely maintenance and repair of facilities
must be in place to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other
animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The 'Circle Pen' housing approximately ten Reindeer had several sections of plastic mesh fencing material lying on
the ground inside the pen or torn and loosely attached to the steel corral panels. Loose sections of plastic meshing
on the ground may pose the risk of ingestion by the animals or injury by entrapment in the mesh material. Facility
enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals. A system of timely facility repair/replacement and maintenance must be in place.
