2.31(d)(1) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Surgery records for regulated animals were reviewed and some were noted as practice/training procedures in the records.
Some of the practice procedures were survival surgery. On 8/31/22 the lab manager and lab's principal investigator (PI)
confirmed animals used to date for procedures have not been towards the study but for training or process validation.
The currently IACUC approved protocol LU-RP-21001 involves these procedures for use towards a study, however the
use of animals for training or process validation purposes is not in an IACUC approved proposal of animal activity. Using
animals only within the confines confines of an IACUC-approved protocol for animal use is required to help ensure all
Animal Welfare Act (AWA) requirements for a study are being followed. The facility's IACUC must ensure that the
activities being conducted are in accordance with an IACUC-approved protocol as required by the AWA.
Correct immediately.
2.31(d)(1)(ii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Proposal LU-RP-21001 involves surgery on Peromyscus mice. The consideration for alternatives narrative does not have
a written consideration or methods used to determine if alternatives to the surgeries to be done for the research question
are available or not. Lack of a written consideration for alternatives and the methods and sources used (most commonly


a scholarly literature search) to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain to the animals doesn't
ensure that the procedures are necessary for research proposed. To minimize painful/distressing procedures, the
IACUC must ensure that the consideration for alternatives to for those procedures is complete.
Correct prior to conducting work under this protocol.
2.32(c)(3)

Personnel qualifications.
Four animals in the surgery records were noted to have undergone survival surgery but their weights were not noted on
the record and the dose of analgesia administered was not noted. Analgesia was noted on other animals with weights
recorded for procedures. Discussion with the PI and lab manager could not confirm if these four animals received
analgesia or not. No notation of weight (needed to calculate a dose of analgesia) and not noting whether a post-surgery
animal received analgesia doesn't ensure that proper use of analgesics is in place for each recovering animal. Ensure
that the weight of each animal is accurately obtained and agents administered to an animal are properly recorded to help
maintain proper use of anesthetics and analgesics.
Correct from this day forward.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
A 9/8/2022 phone call found the last time the AV recalls visiting the animal facility was late Fall 2021. The written
program of veterinary care states semi-annual visits from the AV will be conducted minimally. Regular scheduled visits
from the AV are required to ensure adequate veterinary care of animals at the facility is in place. The facility must ensure
that the AV is contacted to make regular scheduled visits to the facility at least as often as the program of veterinary care
states.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
