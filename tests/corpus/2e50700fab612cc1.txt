ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A large number of medications in the clinic area were outdated. Outdated medications may not be effective, and
some medications can actually become harmful when outdated. Medications on-hand should be routinely checked
and outdated medications should be removed so that they can't be administered to animals.
This was corrected at the time of inspection by removing all expired medications.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
