ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1420 on
31-May-18.
I arrived at the facility at 2:20pm to a locked gate across the driveway. I called the number provided and the
licensee stated that she was not home and that she was down to only 4 breeding females and would not be
renewing her license, due next month.
