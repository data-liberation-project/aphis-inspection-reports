2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
** The following outdated medication was identified in the locked drug box in procedure prep space: Acepromazine
50 ml bottle exp 9/17. Surgical records for 3 chinchillas that underwent surgery on 10/31/17 (#702; #703; and #707)
were reviewed. According to the surgical records, investigator staff administered Acepromazine to the 3 chinchillas
as part of the IACUC approved anesthesia regimen. APHIS inspectors verified that the only source of
Acepromazine available at the time of surgery was the bottle with exp date of 9/17.
Per this Section of the Regulations, each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent and treat diseases and injuries. The use of
outdated or expired medications may not be safe or efficacious, and is not considered to be an acceptable practice.
Medications that are past their expiration date can deteriorate with time and may not result in the intended
therapeutic effects in the animals.
Although the expired medications were immediately discarded at the time of the inspection, the research facility
needs to ensure that all personnel involved in animal care, including research staff, are familiar with the guidelines
for administering in-date medications. In addition, the research facility needs to review its procedures for monitoring
drugs to ensure that all medications being used on research animals are in current dating.
Correct from this date 11/1/17 forward.
NOTE - Exit briefing held 11/1/17 on-site with facility representatives.
