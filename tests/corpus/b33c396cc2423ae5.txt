3.1(b) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The floor of the whelping building was 30 percent covered with an accumulation of shredded paper. There were
small metal feeders, heat lamp covers, a soiled roll of carpet, section of sock adsorbing plastic, can of paint and a
bucket with deer antlers on the floor. These item(s) can attract and provide living and breeding areas for vermin,
pests and other rodents. Thus, increasing the disease potential for the seven adult dogs and 29 puppies.
For the prevention of insects, pest, vermin and disease hazards, all animal areas must be free of accumulations of
trash, shredder paper, soiled rolls of carpet, tools, heat lamp covers, metal feeders and other discarded matter.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
* Two metal self-feeders, used to feed a total of nine adult dogs, had an accumulation of brown debris or caked on
feed. This buildup was located in the part of the metal feeder where the dogs eat from. This indicates the feeders
are not being cleaned and sanitized often enough and can increase the disease potential for the dogs.
For the prevention of an accumulation of debris, caked on feed and disease hazards, all feeders must be cleaned
and sanitized more often in accordance with Section 3.11(b) (3) of the regulation.
