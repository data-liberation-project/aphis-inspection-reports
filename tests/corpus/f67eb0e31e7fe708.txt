3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** The floor in the food prep area still needs to be resealed. Much of the floor is wood and is absorbing liquids
which makes the area difficult to clean and sanitize. The floor needs to be addressed to facilitate cleaning of the
area and for the health of the animals.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the end of the inspection.
