Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence around the cat enclosures has no gate. The large, unobstructed opening prevents the perimeter
fence from serving as a secondary enclosure in case of escape. It may also allow unauthorized access to the animals by
people or other animals.
A complete perimeter fence is required for the safety of the animals in the facility.

Watering.
The water containers for the cats have dark material partially coating the inside of the containers, and two also have a
significant amount of bedding material in the water.
Water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary to ensure adequate water intake and prevent intake of contaminated
water.

Employees.


Two servals escaped when a person covering animal care for the licensee didn't properly lock an enclosure. The animals
were recovered without incident and returned to their enclosure.
Proper training and instruction for animal care personnel is necessary to ensure adequate daily observation of the animals
and to prevent mishaps resulting from missed tasks.
Correct by providing adequate instruction and supervision to animal care workers from this point forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
