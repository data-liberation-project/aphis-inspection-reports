2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female corgi has an area of opacity covering the upper half of her left cornea. She has a very slight tendency to hold
the eye closed, although at times she seems to open it normally. She seems comfortable and her behavior is normal.
The licensee noticed the opacity in the eye 24 hours ago and was waiting to see if there was any change before calling
the attending veterinarian.
Changes in the clarity of the cornea can be an indication of injury that can progress to more serious disease.
The licensee must use appropriate methods to control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee must
contact their attending veterinarian when dogs show signs of possible injury or disease. The licensee called their
attending veterinarian about his dog before the inspector left the facility.
3.3(e)(1)(ii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
This new site has 4 enclosures with outdoor runs that house 14 dogs. The concrete is not sealed.
Porous surfaces that are not sealed (not impervious to moisture) can absorb urine and water contaminated with fecal
material and can not be properly cleaned and sanitized.


Outdoor floor areas in contact with the animals that are made of concrete or other hard materials must be impervious to
moisture.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not list the dosages for the medication used for treatment of internal
parasites in puppies. The PVC also does not include a schedule for testing for internal parasites or heartworm.
Heartworm disease is caused by a parasite that can cause significant damage to the heart before visible symptoms are
seen. Likewise, intestinal parasites can cause chronic disease that can be difficult to detect. Intestinal parasites can also
be spread from mother to puppies. Because of these risks to the health of dogs and puppies, regular testing in necessary
to ensure control and early detection and preventative treatment plans must be complete and easy to follow.
The licensee must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests in accordance with
a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian. Treatment plans must be complete, including names of medications
and dosages. The licensee must consult with their attending veterinarian and add a schedule for testing for heartworms
and intestinal parasites to the Program of Veterinary Care.
3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care does not include plans for preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and

These plans are important in maintaining the health of dogs and for the prevention and early detection of disease.
The Program of Veterinary Care must include plans for preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted
hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth.
