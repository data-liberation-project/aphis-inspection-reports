ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 PM on
30-Aug-16.This Pet Shop is closed, no longer in business. The licensee has moved to another location and during
a previous visit it was stated they were not going to conduct regulated activity. The licensee was notified to contact
the eastern regional office in writing to cancel their USDA license. This inspector visited the new Pet Shop, however
it was closed so I contacted the phone number on file, but no one answered.
No regulated activity can be conducted at the new location unless approved by USDA.
