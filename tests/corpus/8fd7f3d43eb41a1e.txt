ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care states Ivermectin at a dose of .3 mg/kg will be used for heartworm prevention for
the border collies. The licensee states he uses Eqvalan, a paste form of Ivermectin labled for horses for the dogs
,however he was not sure of the correct dose to give the dogs . Eqvalan paste is not listed on the program of
veterinary care to be used for heartworm prevention. Overdose of Ivermectin may cause serious health problems in
breeds such as Border Collies. The attending veterinarian must be consulted concerning the proper heartworm
prevention product to be used in these dogs . The written program of veterinary care must be amended to reflect the
drug and correct dose to be used for heartworm prevention. It must be followed to ensure proper veterinary care is
provided.
