PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Enclosures used on the back wall as a holding area for two rabbits had wire points and loose wire mesh that the

rabbits come into contact with must be maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from possible injury.

3.53(b)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At least two enclosures were over-crowded with rabbits. One enclosure had 6 weaned dwarf rabbits and the other
had 5 weaned dwarf rabbits. The rabbits were estimated to weigh less than 4.4 lbs. Weaned rabbits that weigh
less than 4.4 lbs are required to have at least 1.5 square feet of floor space per rabbit. The enclosures were
measured to have 5.3 square feet of floor space, which is enough space for 3 weaned rabbits of this size.
Over-crowding animals can cause them to get sick easier and does not provide for their wellbeing. To protect
animal health and provide for their wellbeing, rabbits must be provided at least the minimum amount of floor space.
