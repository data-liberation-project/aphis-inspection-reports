PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "Adult Room" there is a section of enclosures against the wall that have access doors cut into the wall that
allows the dogs to go into outdoor enclosures. There is an air conditioning unit installed in the wall above the
access door of one of these enclosures and it is dripping water into the outdoor section. The entire flooring of the
outdoor enclosure that is beneath the air conditioner was completely wet and the two dogs housed in this enclosure
had wet hair on their legs and feet. The air conditioning unit was dripping water continuously into this enclosure
while being observed by the inspector.
Wet hair coats could have a negative effect on the dogs' health and well-being. All primary enclosures must be
constructed and maintained so that they enable the dogs to remain dry. Licensee must replace, repair or alter the
air conditioning unit in a manner that keeps the outdoor enclosure beneath it dry. Licensee must ensure that all
enclosures keep the dogs dry in order to promote their health and well-being. The dogs were moved to a different
enclosure during the inspection.

through any openings in the floor. The licensee must replace, repair or alter this wire flooring in manner that would
not allow the dogs' feet and legs to pass through. The licensee must ensure that the flooring in all enclosures is
