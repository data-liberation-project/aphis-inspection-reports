ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An approximately one year old male lion appears to be in an abnormal condition. It was observed in the corner of
its enclosure unwilling to walk with visible twitching of the head and face. It also showed signs of irregular eye and
tongue movement. Licensee stated that the animal was examined by the attending veterinarian in the fall of 2013
and the lion is currently under treatment. However, the lion appears to not be responding to the present treatment
by showing signs of the abnormalities stated above.
Abnormal conditions require regular evaluation by the attending veterinarian to ensure the health, well-being, and
comfort of the animal.
The animal needs to be reevaluated by the attending veterinarian.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Licensee currently has an environmental enrichment plan specific by species of primate however, there is no plan
for the ringtail lemurs.
Not having a documented and approved environmental enrichment plan for the lemurs does not ensure that the
psychological needs of the ringtailed lemurs are being met.
An environmental enrichment plan for the ringtailed lemurs must be developed and approved by the facility's
attending veterinarian.
