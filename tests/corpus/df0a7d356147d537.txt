2.75(b)(1)(iv)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Sale records were not available for older weanlings and adult guinea pigs sold in the last few months. Failure to maintain
these records makes if difficult to assess the caviary by identifying animal decreases of animals born, and to keep track of
animals used or sold for regulated activities to ensure their care and use. The licensee must maintain records with the
name and address of the buyer of all guinea pig disposed of or sold. Correct by April 9, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
