ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***One adult female giraffe named (cid:28)Mary(cid:29) was observed to have overgrown feet. She was not noted to be limping at
this time and was moving around the enclosure. The inside claw on both rear feet on this animal are elongated,
extend past the outside claw and are starting to twist away from the outside claw. The left rear foot is more severely
affected with the inside claw curling upwards off the ground in addition to twisting. Untreated overgrown hooves can
cause discomfort to the animals and can cause abnormal forces to be placed on the joints in the foot and limb
causing additional medical problems. When hooves do not wear naturally, routine hoof trimming (as directed by the
attending veterinarian) is necessary. Review of veterinary records states that the attending veterinarian noted the
elongated hooves on 4/4/16 and stated that hoof trimming is to (cid:28)be done ASAP(cid:29). The facility representative stated
hoof trimming had been scheduled but had to be cancelled due to scheduling. The giraffes shall be evaluated for
hoof trimming needs and any giraffes with long hooves including the female (cid:28)Mary(cid:29) shall have their hooves trimmed.
***The current program of veterinary care, updated since the Mar. 2015 inspection, indicates that for all hoofstock
species except Blackbuck and Nilgai succinylcholine will be the sole agent used for capture and chemical restraint
for procedures such as exams and lameness treatment. During conversations with facility representatives it was
ascertained that succinylcholine is the sole current drug being used as recently as last week to immobilize
hoofstock. The veterinarian approved instructions discuss the care and monitoring of the animal during the use of
the neuromuscular blocker but makes no mention of the fact that during immobilization with neuromuscular blocking
agents the animals remain fully conscious and are sensitve to pain, stress and stimulation. Succinylcholine is a
paralytic agent that has no pain relieving or tranquilizing properties. In addition, this type of drug paralyzes
respiratory muscles causing decreases in respiration rate that can be severe enough to lead to death if the animals
are not ventilated appropriately. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities or training to intubate or
mechanically ventilate animals if they stop breathing. Neuromuscular blockers such as succinylcholine should not
be used without concurrent appropriate use of anesthesia/analgesia and support measures (ventilation and
monitoring) to avoid the distressing effects, respiratory depression and enhanced risk of death due to paralysis of
respiratory muscles. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available which are able to
chemically restrain animals without causing paralysis while providing anesthesia and analgesia. The licensee must
maintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods of immobilizing and restraining
hoofstock that are consistent with providing adequate veterinary care. Correct by: June 15, 2016.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public is permitted to walk directly up to the primary enclosures containing several species of animals
including goats, sheep, zebu cattle, llama, and camel. These animals are housed in multiple areas including the
walk through area (for the sheep, goats, zebu, and llama) and the wagon loading area where one camel is housed
in a horse stall. There are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests can feed food
sold at the entry gate. There are no attendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly up to
enclosures and pet the animals since primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for
the guests to reach through and touch the animals. Unattended public contact does not ensure safe public
interaction with the animals. The licensee must ensure that during periods of public exhibition animals are handled
with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety
of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public contact with these animals or by ensuring
that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these locations to ensure the safety of both the public
and the animals.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Guests are permitted to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. No attendants are present in the drive
through area when these unaccompanied visits are taking place. During this inspection the inspectors noticed
guests feeding animals through car windows and other than wagon drivers passed no other employee staff were
noted. A hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the entry gate advises them to remain in their vehicles at all times
but does not discourage feeding. This facility also has horse drawn wagons that takes guests thru and allows public
feeding with an attendant/driver present. Allowing guests to feed from vehicles without attendants present does not
protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a barrier or distance from the animals and the public. Correct
this by providing an attendant at all times during public contact.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The metal bars for the indoor area of the Ringtail Lemur enclosure on the lower Lemur island are in need of
maintenance. There are areas where the paint is either worn off or chipped and there is rust covering a significantarea of the bars. These areas have become difficult to impossible to sanitize in their current condition and require
replacement, repainting, or resurfacing. Failure to be able to properly sanitize can expose the animals to potential
disease hazards.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Several rodent holes were found around the outside edges of Ringtail Lemur housing structure on both islands.
Rodent pests are potential disease hazards and may contaminate food and water supplies. The facility must
establish and maintain a pest control program to effectively control these mammalian pests.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure housing two adult African Crested porcupines is in need of repair. The porcupines have dug out
the dirt of the ground underneath the buried wire flooring material in three areas. The wire flooring material has
openings approximately 3inx3in. The areas include the ground underneath and all around the elevated food
receptacle, the area underneath the elevated water receptacle and in one corner of the enclosure. The openings
may lead to injury if the animals try to walk across the affected areas. In addtion, because the affected area extends
for 8-12 inches around the food receptacle, the animals must balance on the wire to access their food. All
enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protected the animals from injury.

WATERING.
*** The animals in the drive-thru area of the facility do not have a potable water source. During this inspection a
facility employee explained that the animals drink from a creek that runs through the drive thru area. He stated that
there is a well near the giraffe/rhino barn that can be used to feed additional water into the creek if required. Water
buffalo were observed bathing in a deeper portion of the creek and animals have access to walk through the creek
throughout the drive-thru area. The water in the creek was murky and muddy in many areas. Failure to provide a
potable water source exposes these animals to potential disease hazards. Even if the well water is used to supply
water to the creek, it is expected that the animals have access to a clean water receptacle rather than drinking from
water that has run through the creek and areas where other animals have bathed, walked, or potentially
urinated/defecated. *** Two water troughs were found to be excessively dirty during this inspection. A trough for the camel in the front
pasture contained cloudy water with insect larvae swimming around the edges of the water. A second trough for the
zebu and llamas in the front pasture had algae growing in the bottom and floating on the top of the water. Both of
these troughs require cleaning to ensure a safe water supply for the animals.
Failure to provide a clean, potable water source for the animals exposes them to disease hazards. Correct this by
ensuring all animals have access to potable water and all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.
Correct by: the dirty water troughs immediately and correct the drive-thru area potable water access by July 1,
2016.
