FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence along the south side of the Zoo has been significantly damaged by fallen trees from last year’s
hurricane (hurricane Michael). There were four main areas where the fence was completely destroyed while other
areas the fence was pushed down to a shorter height than the required 8 feet to enclose the dangerous animals
within (cheetah, bear and wolves). With the significant gaps, the fence does not function as a secondary
containment for the animals and may allow unauthorized people or animals to enter the facility. The perimeter fence
must be repaired and maintained so that it protects all animals within the facility. To be corrected by February 29,
2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the deputy director.
