2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The facility consigned and sold four degus, one hedgehog and two marmosets at the Triple W Alternative Livestock
Auction on 3/3/22. The licensee stated he had records but that they were currently offsite in a truck. Accurate acquisition
and disposition records for all animals bought and sold (brokered) need to be maintained by brokers to allow for legal and
medical tracing of the animals and these records need to be available for APHIS inspectors to review during inspections.
The facility shall have all records required to be kept by the Act and regulations available during business hours for APHIS
officials to review. Correct by 7/14/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
