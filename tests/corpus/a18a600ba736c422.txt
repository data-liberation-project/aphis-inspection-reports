ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* “Lena” a three year old female, black and white Dane, (ID#: 7E10C81170), right eye, had retreated into the eye
socket. The third eye lid covered ½ of the eye and was a bright pink color. There was mild discharge from the eye
causing the hair around the eye to be mildly wet.
* “Mimi” a 2 year old female, tan Cane Corso, (ID#: 7E10081148), third eye lid was protruding outward on the right
eye. The protrusion was approximately ½ inch long and ¼ inch thick. The bottom eye lid is swollen. The eye lids
were dark red in color. There was mild discharge and the hair around the eye was mildly wet.
** For the above mentioned dogs, the condition of the eyes can be due to infections, allergies, injury, irritation or
other medical conditions that could be painful.
The licensee must have these dogs evaluated by the veterinarian for veterinary care and appropriate treatment
plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The
licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
* “Yeti” a five year old male, white and black Husky, (ID#: 7E10081163), was limping or favoring his right front leg
when walking and standing. The leg was constantly favored, even when standing, and the foot was loosely hanging.
The foot was abnormally shaped.
This can be the result of an injury or other medical conditions that could be painful.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by the veterinarian for veterinary care and appropriate treatment plan.
The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(a)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two enclosures housing two adult dogs and seven puppies had hanging heat lamps within the enclosures. These
heat lamps did not have protection guards and were accessible to the dogs. With accessibility by the dogs, this
could possibly injure the animals.
All facilities or heating systems must be designed, so to protect the animals from injury.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The Old Kennel building has three dog doors used by four adult dogs. The wood door ways for these dog doors
was excessively chewed and scratched. Counting from the south the third enclosure had a hole chewed through
the outside back wall.
The Block B area of the New Kennel had a 1 inch by 1 inch piece of wood board running along the bottom of the
back wall for enclosures located on both sides of the alley. The wood board for seven of these enclosures, housing
seven adult dogs, was excessively chewed and scratched.

These excessively chewed and scratched wood surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. Without proper
cleaning and sanitation, the disease potential for the animals increases.
All surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitation, thus
reducing the disease potential to the animals.
3.8(b)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
* An enclosure inside the New Kennel housed two Great Danes. The enclosure measured: 61 inches by 60 inches
totaling 3, 660 inches of space.
The one dog measured: 47 inches by 47 inches totaling 2,209 inches. The other dog measured: 47 inches by 47
inches totaling 2,209 inches.
The combined total for the two dogs is: 2,209 + 2,209 totaling 4,418 inches.

The enclosure size is 3,660 inches and total space for the dogs is 4,418 inches, therefore the total enclosure spacedoes not 100 percent exercise space. The lack to exercise space can affect the health and well-being of the dogs.
All enclosures must meet 100 percent exercise space for the health and well-being of the animals.
This inspection was for site 002. No covered activity can be conducted at this site until the site has no
non-compliant item(s).
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI).
