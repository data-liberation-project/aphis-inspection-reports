2.126(a)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Records were not able to be reviewed at the time of this inspection because the licensee was unavailable and the
facility representative did not have access to the facility records. Not being able to review facility records does not
ensure that proper documentation and record keeping requirements are being met. Ensure that all required facility
records are available for review by APHIS officials at the time of inspection. Correct from this day forward.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an open bag of puppy food sitting on the floor that is not stored in a container with a lid. Improper storage
of food does not adequately protect the food from contamination. Store all open supplies of food in containers with
lids. Correct by August 18, 2015.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the facility representative.
End of report.
