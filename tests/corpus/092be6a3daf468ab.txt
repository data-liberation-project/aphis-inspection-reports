WATERING.
* The water provided to the geriatric bobcat was observed to be frozen at the time of inspection (approximately
11:00 AM). When potable water was presented to the bobcat, it drank continuously for just under two minutes. The
animal care supervisor stated that the water receptacle was last filled at 5:00 PM on the previous day. The heated
water receptacle was not plugged in to prevent the water from freezing during the night. According to the “NOAA”
website (weather.gov.) when searching on the licensee’s zip code, the lowest temperature listed in the last 24 hours
was 16 degrees Fahrenheit. Insufficient amount of water, especially in geriatric felines, can lead to dehydration
which reduces the animal’s ability to maintain normal body functions and could lead to further health risks for the
animal. The licensee must ensure that water is provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the
animal. Frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size and type of the animal. Corrected at the
time of inspection.

SANITATION.
* Pieces of plastic were observed along the bottom of the outdoor enclosure fencing housing two sheep. The
plastic appeared to be pulled into the enclosure in places along the ground. Chewing of the plastic could lead to
accidental ingestion of the plastic pieces. The premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the
animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in
designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. Corrected at the time of inspection.
* Facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 4/4/18 and exit briefing done on 4/5/18 were conducted with
the Supertendent and Animal Care Supervisor.
