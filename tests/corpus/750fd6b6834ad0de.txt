INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Item IACUC 2.31 c 3
At the time of inspection the semiannual report was reviewed. the report dated Jan 2015 did not have any
signatures of the IACUC members. In addition the minutes for a July meeting indicated only physical inspection of
the facility was completed however there is no mention of a program review.
The IACUC needs to insure the semiannual reports are complete to include both program review and physical plant
inspection every 6 months as required and signed by a majority of IACUC members.
Correct from this day 12/16/2015
An exit interview took place at the end of inspection
