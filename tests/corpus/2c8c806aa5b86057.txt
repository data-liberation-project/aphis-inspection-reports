ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The black male alpaca housed with three other male alpacas has hair loss on his face. The hair is mostly gone
from the bridge of his nose and the hair loss extends down both sides of his nose to his upper lip. The hair loss is
most severe on the left side with hair loss under his left nostril and above his left upper lip. The facility records
noted in June of 2016 that this alpaca had “minor hair loss on the bridge of nose, skin below uninjured, will watch for
change.” There is nothing in the records that documents the spread of the hair loss. The black male alpaca has
had no testing or treatment for the hair loss. Hair loss has many causes such as parasites, trauma, infection, and
other medical problems. The hair loss may be contagious to the other alpacas and people. During the inspection
the public was observed hand feeding the four alpaca in the enclosure. The alpaca must be evaluated by the
attending veterinarian to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment, and resolution of the condition, must
be documented and made available to the APHIS officials upon request. Correct by October 29, 2016.

CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
A continental rabbit was housed in the same enclosure as a wallaby. Free roaming peacocks also have access to
this enclosure. During this inspection one to four peacocks were observed in this enclosure with the rabbit and
wallaby. Rabbits cannot be housed in same enclosure with any other species unless required for scientific reasons.
The rabbit was separated from the wallaby at time of inspection. Facility must ensure that peacocks do not have
access to the rabbit enclosure to protect health of the animal. Correct by November 2, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing the two African crested porcupine had a protruding wire strand on the lower left corner of the
chain link door. A large rock had fallen inside the enclosure from the back wall of the outdoor area leaving the height
in this area only 27 inches from the ground. This rock and a nearby log could have been used to help the
porcupines escape. All enclosures must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals securely. Once APHIS officials identified the structural items, facility maintenancepersonnel repaired the door and back wall. Corrected at time of inspection.
This inspection was conducted with the manager and senior zoo keeper and exit interview was conducted with the
zoo director.
