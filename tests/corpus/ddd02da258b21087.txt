FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor enclosure for the muntjac has had some damage to the wall boards along one side of the enclosure at
the level of the floor up to approximately one foot high. The missing wall board material has led to exposed
insulation which the muntjac has access to. Eating or contact with the insulation could lead to health issues for the
muntjac. The indoor housing facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the muntjac. Correct by
2/10/2020.
