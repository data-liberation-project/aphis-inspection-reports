An adult female Papillion ID 102 was observed with a wad of hair stuck between her lower front teeth. When asked
to remove the animal for closer inspection the licensee pulled the hair out of the animal's teeth causing it's gums to
bleed. There was a dark brown substance covering her molar teeth. The dog was also examined in December of

with severe dental tarter/disease rating her a 5 out of 5 in severity. Additionally, the dog had opening the size of a
pencil eraser on the top of her left front foot that was draining thick pink fluid. The licensee pressed on the foot and

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces(3)
The indoor portion of the sheltered building housing Bulldogs had a buildup of grime, hair and trash. One of the
enclosures containing a female and her 3, three day old puppies had sections of soiled paper towel scattered
across the floor. When asked the licensee stated that they were the paper towels she used to clean the puppies off
with after birth and the dam had torn them apart. The enclosure had a red substance dried on the walls and dog
door of the enclosure. All of the enclosures had thick brown grime and hair along their edges and corners. Adequate
cleaning is an important aspect of animal husbandry and helps to prevent disease, odor, pests. Hard surfaces with
which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this
subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards TO BE CORRECTED BY: 7/10/2014

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements(2)(i)
There were at least two enclosures of the adult sheltered facility (site 2) that had sections of broken 1X1 inch coated
wire flooring. The sharp metal points protruding from the floor may injure the dogs. The licensee shall repair or
replace these areas and ensure that all primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that they have no
sharp points or edges.
3.6(a)(2)(10) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements(2)(x)
A un-weaned puppy housed in the whelping facility was observed with its feet passing through the 1x1 inch
openings of the floor. This could result in injury to the puppy's feet and legs or in the inability for it to learn a proper
gait. The licensee shall provide enclosures with flooring that protects the animals feet and legs from injury, and that
does not allow the animal's feet to pass through any openings in the floor.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.

feces. Some of the feces had dried. When ask, the licensee stated that area had not been cleaned for three days
due to the holiday. Adequate cleaning is a crucial aspect of animal husbandry and helps to reduce disease hazards,
odors and pests. The licensee shall remove excreta from the primary enclosures daily and from under primary
enclosures as often as necessary.
TO BE CORRECTED BY : 7/9/2014
The adult male Yorkshire Terrier ID 78 was dripping wet at the time of the inspection. The kennel staff was using a
hose to wash down on the indoor portion of the facility. The animals in the facility were observed leaving their
enclosures while the staff cleaned, however, they returned when she moved to the adjacent enclosure. Due to the
water pressure, when the staff sprayed an enclosure it reflected off of the wash down into the adjacent enclosures,
wetting the returning dogs such as the Yorkshire Terrier. Bacteria and disease can be spread when animals are
soiled or wetted from water reflecting from the wash down area. When steam or water is used to clean the primary
enclosure, whether by hosing, flushing, or other methods, dogs must be removed, unless the enclosure is large
enough to ensure the animals would not be harmed, wetted, or distressed in the process. TO BE CORRECTED BY:
