FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The water spicket for the pigs has been damaged and there is water streaming into the rear of the enclosure. This
water spicket needs to be repaired or replaced so this area in the pen does not have standing water. There are
other areas in the pig enclosure that are mudded, however there needs to be an area where the soil remains dry.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and or illness.
