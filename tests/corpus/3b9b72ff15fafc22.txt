ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A German Shepherd (#GS230) had the top half of its right ear missing. The ear had dried up blood on part of it
along with an open wound on the other part of it. The licensee had not noticed this prior to the inspection. An open
wound can be painful and can lead to an infection. The dog must be seen by a Veterinarian by 11/19/15.

COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
While reviewing the paperwork during the inspection, Form 7005 showed that a Husky (animal #HK-052) born on
12/7/09 died on 8/22/15. It was noted that the dog "Died 8-22-15 dog fight". Dogs must be compatibly housed
together. Failure to do so can result in injuries which can be painful for the dogs and can result in death such as the
Husky noted above. Correct by 11/18/15.
