FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the facility there were areas of fencing that were broken, falling down, or otherwise in disrepair. These
areas presented possible escape routes or sources of injury through puncture, abrasion, or entrapment. Two goats
were noted to be limping at the time of inspection which could be related to the condition of the fencing. Two lambs
were outside of their primary enclosure at the time of inspection. Two kids were outside their primary enclosure and
appeared confined to an area with no shelter. Facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility is currently using a semi-trailer to store their feed bags. On inspections, there were several open bags
that were not being stored appropriately. One bag was observed to have a hole chewed in the top side of the bag.
In addition, a dead rat was found in this area. In the barn where the animals were being housed, there were several
bales of straw that were sitting directly on the ground with no protection from the moisture or animal excreta. A
significant amount of bird excreta was observed on at least one bale inside the barn. Improper storage of food and
bedding can allow for spoilage and attract unwanted pests and vermin. All food and bedding must be stored in a
manner in which it is adequately protected against deterioration, mold or contamination by vermin.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
This facility currently disposes of all animal waste, food waste, used bedding and debris in a large mound outside of
the barn in the enclosure that houses llamas, goats, zebu, horses and donkey. Improper disposal of waste and
debris could be contributing to the pest and vermin issue within the facility. This facility must have a proper method
to dispose of all animal waste, food waste, bedding and debris. Disposal facilities shall be so provided and operatedas to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards.

SANITATION.
Excessive clutter was evident inside and outside of the building. This clutter could cause injury to the animals and
serve as harborage for pests. Cobwebs were present throughout the building and contained large amounts of dust
which could lead to respiratory issues in the animals confined there. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept
clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry
practices.

SANITATION.
During today's inspection, there was a dead mouse that was decomposing in the feed storage area. In addition,
there was an excessive amount of flies observed to be in a majority of the animal housing and food storage areas.
Several flies were noticed crawling all over a corn based feed located in an open wheelbarrow in the middle of the
barn. Tires were present in the pasture and contained muddy water which provides for an environment that
promotes mosquito breeding as well as a water source in the pasture for small vermin. Pest and insects can
contribute to disease hazards. This facility must establish and maintain a safe and effective pest control program
for insects, ectoparasites, and avian mammalian.
