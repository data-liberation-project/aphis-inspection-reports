ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At least four juvenile black bears showed significant hair loss and demonstrated repeated episodes of scratching
while observed during the inspection. There were no skin lesions beyond the hair loss, and all of the bears
appeared otherwise healthy. Facility records indicate that there was a phone consultation with the attending
veterinarian on 10 January 2014 regarding the black bear cubs hair loss. At that time, records indicate the animals
were dewormed with ivermectin. However, since that initial treatment there is no indication of any further treatment
or diagnostic testing. Medical problems that persist despite initial treatment must be followed up with appropriate
care, including any necessary diagnostic testing. These affected black bears must be examined by the attending
veterinarian in a timely manner, and treated as necessary. Records of all examinations, testing, and treatments
must be maintained by the facility.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the indoor portion of a sheltered enclosure housing a single snow macaque, an elevated metal resting surface
had an area of rust which had worn through the surface and created a hole with sharp edges. This creates a risk of
entrapment for the enclosed animal, as well as a risk of injury from the sharp edges. The facility must repair or
replace this resting platform, and must maintain metal surfaces throughout the facility to protect the welfare of the
animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure containing two tigers (Ladoux and Safari) contains a small pond with a central island connected to the
rest of the enclosure by a pair of wooden walkways. One of the walkways is missing a plank, and there is a screw
point exposed at the top of the brace where the plank should connect. The missing plank is a potential source of
injury to the enclosed animals, as is the exposed sharp point. The facility needs to repair and properly maintain thiswalkway.
