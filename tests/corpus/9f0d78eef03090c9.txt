2.31(d)(1)(ii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC-approved protocols 001 and 004 contain no search for alternatives and no narrative describing whether
alternatives were found. Failure to search for alternatives to procedures that cause more than momentary or slight pain or
distress to the animals, and not including the narrative to document that search, can result in the use of procedures that
may be duplicative and/or may cause harm or injury to animals. The regulations require the search for alternatives and a
narrative documenting whether alternatives were available. Correct by October 30, 2020.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
