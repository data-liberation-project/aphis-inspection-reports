2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A female English Bulldog (IC5C) had a left eye that appeared reddened compared to the right eye. A small
amount of thick whitish green discharge was noted in the fur near the corner of the eye. Upon closer observation,
the tissue under the eyelids and in the corner of the eye appeared inflamed and red. A small, raised, mass-like
lesion was noted in the corner of the eye. This eye condition could indicate an infection, injury, or other veterinary
medical condition which could be uncomfortable or may lead to blindness.
***Two female Boxers, "Xana" (4B1A520A10) and "Neo" (4B047B3456), were observed to be very thin. Both dogs
had ribs that were easily visible and both had obvious waists and abdominal tucks. "Xana" also had prominent
lumbar vertebrae and pelvic bones. According to the licensee, he had noted the dogs to be thin in January and that
they had gotten thinner since that time. He also said that a veterinarian had last seen the dogs in January during a
facility inspection. There was no documentation at the facility regarding the body condition of these dogs; however,
documentation initialed by the attending veterinarian in January indicated that these dogs were not sound for
breeding. The licensee stated that he was offering dry adult dog food at all times in a self feeder. Additionally he
said he was offering a bowl of wetted dry puppy food and only one can of dog food for both dogs daily and noted
that they do not finish it. Poor body condition in dogs can be due to inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other
underlying medical problems.
***A female Lhasa Apso (483E784623) was noticeably not as active as the other dog with which it shared an
enclosure. The dog was observed mostly lying down while the other dog in the enclosure as well as the other dogs
in nearby pens were up and running around. On closer observation, the dog had a build up of yellowish brown to
dark brown material on its teeth. This abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the cheek teeth and
extended into the gumline. The gums had receded along some of these teeth. While looking in the mouth on the left
side, there appeared to be an open space above one of the upper premolars where a root may normally be visible.
There was a vertical line of yellowish material noted in the area of the gum tissue above the upper right teeth. The
abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This can be
painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal.
The licensee was not aware of the dog with the eye condition nor the dog with the dental condition. The licenseemust have all of the above animals examined in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate
treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care
program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the facility. The licensee must ensure
that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***An outside area of an enclosure in the northwest sheltered building has two areas of torn and separated chain
fencing. One of these areas has at least one long loose wire end protruding into the enclosure. One opening
looked to have been previously patched with a smaller gauge wire but at this time the dogs have pushed the wires
aside to create an opening. One of the openings is of a size that could allow a dog to escape or become trapped
while attempting to escape. Protruding wires pose an injury risk to the dogs within these enclosures.The licensee
must ensure, at all times, that all animal housing facilities are kept in good repair, and that they protect the animals
from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. To be corrected by: May 9, 2016.
*Note - the female Basset Hound named Peanut Butter included on the report for the December 15, 2015 inspection
under 2.40 (b)(2) was no longer at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee by Dr. Erika Leisner-VMO and Curt
McGruder-ACI.
