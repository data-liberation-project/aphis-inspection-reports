ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male camel was noted to be in thin body condition such that his hip bones and back bone were more
prominent. The camel also had 2 small circular areas of hair loss (1 viewed from the back right, 1 viewed from the
back right side) that appeared to be scabbed over sores on the right hip. The facility representative stated he had
noted the camel seemed thin but was eating well. The facility representative attributed the thin body condition to old
age (the camel is approximately 16 years of age). The attending veterinarian had not been contacted nor had any
other actions been taken to address the loss of body condition despite a normal appetite. Thin body condition can
be an indication of an underlying disease. This animal must be seen and evaluated by a licensed veterinarian, with
written diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up plans, no later than 2/14/2014.
