RECORDS, DISPOSITION.
The cage card the licensee is using for inventory purposes was not available for a litter of puppies whelped on
4/27/17. According to the facility representative these records are not being kept after the litters are sold.
Maintaining litter records aids in the ability to track litters. All required records must be held for 1 year after the
animal(s) are disposed of or removed from the facility. Correct from this date forward.
This focused inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
