INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Consideration of Alternatives.
**Protocol #16-51 includes a procedure that would be considered more than momentarily painful or distressful but
the protocol approved by the IACUC did not contain a written narrative description of the methods and sources used
to determine that alternatives were not available to that procedure.
**Protocol #16-86 includes several procedures that would be considered more than momentarily painful or
distressful but the protocol approved by the IACUC did not contain a written narrative description of the methods
and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available to those procedures.
Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever a proposal for animal use contains procedures that may cause more
than momentary pain or distress to the animals, the investigator is required to consider alternatives to those
procedures and provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that
alternatives were not available. This requirement is important to ensure that all procedures involving animals
minimize pain and distress to the animals.
The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for these two protocols.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Complete Description of Animal Use.
** Protocol #16-64 did not contain a complete description of all of the animal use activities to be performed on the
animals that are included in the proposal. The lack of a complete description includes the frequency of blood
collection and the study timelines. Per this Section of the Regulations, proposals to conduct an activity involving animals must contain a complete
description of the proposed use of the animals so the IACUC can determine that the components of the proposed
activities related to the care and use of animals are in accordance with all of the requirements outlined in this
subchapter.
The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for this protocol.
Correct by 6/1/17.
2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
**In March 2016 husbandry staff found 7 voles deceased in their primary enclosures and one other vole was
exhibiting signs of illness; veterinary staff were immediately contacted. The sick vole was humanely euthanized.
Upon being notified and in response to this information, the IACUC and AV immediately looked into the incident.
It was determined that husbandry staff had changed water bottles on all of the enclosures in the vole housing room
2 days earlier but had failed to put a replacement bottle on 4 enclosures containing the 8 animals; in addition
husbandry staff failed to detect the lack of a water bottle on the 4 enclosures during the daily observations. As a
result the animals did not have access to water for 2 days.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the handling of animals by all personnel, including husbandry staff, should be
done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm, behavioral stress, or unnecessary
discomfort.
The research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to
OLAW, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future. Corrective
actions included but were not limited to implementing changes to SOPs related to animal care and husbandry
practices and providing additional retraining of husbandry staff. No additional incidents have occurred.
This item has been appropriately addressed and corrected by the research facility.
3.81(e)(1)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Exemptions.**At the time of inspection, 2 NHPs were identified that are singly housed without either a permanent or an IACUC
approved exemption. They had arrived in July 2016, were singly housed during the quarantine period, and have
remained singly housed since the quarantine period ended.
The review of the medical records for both of the NHPs revealed that although the Attending Veterinarian (AV) has
made some entries referring to the single housing status of the animals, entries have not been made every 30 days,
and the basis of the exemption to social housing was not consistently recorded.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the Attending Veterinarian (AV) may exempt an individual nonhuman primate
from participation in the environment enhancement plan because of its health or condition, or in consideration of its
well-being. The basis of the exemption must be recorded by the AV for each exempted nonhuman primate. Unless
the basis for the exemption is a permanent condition, the exemption must be reviewed at least every 30 days by the
AV.
The AV needs to review all NHPs that may be exempted from participation in the research facility’s environmental
enhancement plan at least every 30 days when the reason for the exemption is not permanent or required for
scientific reasons as described in an IACUC approved research proposal.
Correct by 5/1/17.
