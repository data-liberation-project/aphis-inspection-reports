3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence is incomplete. An approximately 12 foot section of the tiger enclosure is not enclosed by a
perimeter fence. On the opposite side, the perimeter fence appears to be less than 8 feet high. Without a perimeter
fence, the tigers could be exposed to unauthorized persons or animals, which may pose a disease hazard. All
outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence which must be constructed so that it protects the
animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility.
