2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**Female, sealpoint ragdoll, (cid:28)"Spring"(cid:29), ID #12 is still undergoing treatment, however, the condition seems to be
worse. The cat was observed sleeping, and was difficult to rouse. When she held her head up, her eyes were
sealed shut with a thick, yellowish discharge and she was unable to open them at all. The cat immediately put her
head back down and appeared lethargic. The cat was curled up and never attempted to rise during the course of
the inspection. Lethargy can be a sign of pain and/or indicate the presence of a serious medical condition. The
licensee failed to consult with her veterinarian when the cat did not respond to the prescribed treatment and
developed new problems.
**Female, sealpoint ragdoll, "(cid:28)Rainey"(cid:29), ID #45 is still undergoing treatment, however, the condition has not
improved. She is still squinting in both eyes. The third eyelids are still raised and appear pink, and the outer eyelids,
both upper and lower, still appear pink and inflamed. There is a light tan to yellowish discharge around both eyes
with accompanying tear drainage. The fur about an inch surrounding each eye appears to be wet. The licensee
states she has been following the treatment recommended by the veterinarian, and has shown documentation of
both the veterinary notes and the treatment given. However, she acknowledges the treatment does not appear to
be having any affect, and has failed to consult with the veterinarian about this issue.
**Male, bluepoint ragdoll, "(cid:28)Blue Ice"(cid:29), ID # 10 is squinting in both eyes, has a crusty yellowish discharge around
both eyes, and the eyelids appear slightly pink and inflamed. The licensee stated she noticed this condition on
April 15, and started following the same treatment as the female ragdolls identified here. She stated she did not
consult her veterinarian specifically about this cat.

Eye problems can be an indicator of injury, disease, allergies or irritation, and can be itchy and/or painful, and can
affect the well-being of the animal. It is potentially distressful when an animal cannot open its eyes, and this could
prevent the cat from eating and drinking in a normal manner. Lethargy could indicate that the animal has a serious
medical condition.
The licensee must develop and follow a program of adequate veterinary care including the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries and the availability of emergency, weekend,and holiday care.
The licensee must have these cats examined by a veterinarian to obtain a proper diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. The licensee must document the veterinarian'(cid:25)s findings, the treatment plan that is followed, and
have the records available to the inspector upon request. In addition, the licensee must consult with the
veterinarian if the conditions do not improve.
