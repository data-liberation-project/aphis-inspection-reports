2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On or about April 14, 2022, a member of the public was allowed to enter an enclosure for a personal interaction with a
juvenile black jaguar that was approximately 6 months of age. The interaction was posted on social media and
demonstrated direct contact with no identifiable methods of effective restraint or established barriers shown in the posted
photos. At approximately 12 weeks of age, dangerous animals, such as tigers, lions, bears, and wolves become too big,
too fast and too strong to be used in public contact. During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so that there is
minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the
general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. The facility shall ensure the well-being of both
parties by not allowing members of the public to handle potentially dangerous animals. To be corrected prior to the next
public interaction.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
