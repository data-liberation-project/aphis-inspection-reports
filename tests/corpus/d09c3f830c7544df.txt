PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
One pig on protocol 3XX4 that had abdominal surgery on 9/21/15 was euthanized one day later due to surgical
complications. Necropsy findings included discovery of a surgical towel in the abdominal cavity and acute
peritonitis. Although the animal received appropriate analgesia, it was determined that the post-operative monitoring
of this animal was inadequate and was not performed according to the facility'(cid:25)s standard post-operative monitoring
procedures.
Per this section of the regulations, it is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research
technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care and use are qualified to perform their duties.
The research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to
OLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. Corrective
actions included providing thorough retraining of all personnel involved in the surgical procedures and post-surgical
monitoring associated with this protocol.
The research facility has taken appropriate steps to address this item.
2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The following improperly labelled medications and/or expired drugs were identified in investigator lab spaces during
this inspection: 1 tube of neosporin topical ointment with expiration date of 2013; 8 bottles of eye medication with
expiration dates ranging from 10/2011 (cid:19)to 1/2013; one large syringe containing 30 ml of clear liquid with no
content-identifying label with a date of 11/2/15; one large syringe containing 45 ml of clear liquid which was labeled
(cid:28)ket/roc 4/13/16(cid:29).
As part of the program of veterinary care, the research facility must ensure that all medications are properly labelled
with the contents(cid:25) name and concentration, expiration date. When mixtures of more than one medication areprepared, a (cid:28)"use by(cid:29)" date should be indicated on the label. These measures ensure that medications are identified
correctly, used in safe doses and not used past their expiration date or shelf life. Correct from this date forward.
3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During the inspection of investigators' procedure spaces where animals are brought for electrical recording and
study sessions, accumulations of dust, hair, excess unused materials, surplus equipment, boxes and previously
used medical supplies were noted in and around the animal testing spaces. Although no adverse events have been
reported and no signs of active infection were noted in the animals, the level of cleanliness observed is not
acceptable for an area being used for invasive recording sessions due to the potential for contamination and
infection in the animals.
Animal areas must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment and stored material, but may contain
fixtures and equipment necessary for proper research needs. The level of housekeeping needs to be improved to
ensure the health of the animals. Correct by June 1, 2016.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In June 2015, a prairie vole was found dead outside its enclosure in the vole housing room. Upon being notified, the
research facility determined that the vole cage was not secured into the rack appropriately, allowing the vole to
escape, resulting in its death.
During a recent 11 month period, two sheep were found outside their primary enclosures within the animal room.
Although it could not be determined exactly how the sheep escaped, initial modifications were made to the
enclosures and further modifications are under development.
Per this section of the regulations, enclosures shall contain the animals. The research facility acted promptly to
address these incidents by conducting investigations, reporting the events to OLAW and USDA, and by
implementing appropriate corrective actions including retraining (vole) and enclosure modifications (sheep). The
vole incident is considered corrected. The sheep incident is currently in the process of being corrected, pending
receipt and installation of additional caging materials that have been ordered. Correction date: June 1, 2016.
NOTE: Inspection conducted from 4/19/16 through 4/22/16 by Mary Ann McBride, VMO and Paula Gladue, VMO. Exit interview conducted 4/22/16 on site with facility representatives.
