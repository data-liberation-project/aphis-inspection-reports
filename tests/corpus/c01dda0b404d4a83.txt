HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The licensee recently replaced several sections of wood frame and supports for the primary enclosures. A few
enclosures have wire mesh that is not secured to the frame near the door which is now protruding into the enclosure
and creating a gap between enclosures. These sections need to be secured so they are not protruding inward for
the safety of the dogs.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** The floors in the whelping building need to be resealed. Several sections of the floor in front of the enclosures
have paint that is chipped and peeled away which allows water to seep into the wood floor. These floors need to be
repainted so they are sealed and impervious to moisture to facilitate cleaning and sanitization of the whelping area.
