ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two Saint Bernard dogs have open wounds on their noses. Both dogs, a male (microchip #093 332 617) and a
female (microchip #093 347 352) have open wounds on their muzzle, right before the wet naked surface around the
nostrils. The wounds are very red and appear to be still raw. The owner has talked to his veterinarian about this,
the conclusion they have made is the open wounds are caused by flies. Owner may have to move these dogs into
area that is free from flies until the healing has been completed. (No flies were noticed at the time of this
inspection.) The owner needs to have at least one of these dogs seen by a veterinarian to help get these open
wound healed, set up a program for both dogs and administer the appropriate medication. Keep a record of what
has been done to help heal these dogs. This program needs to be available to the inspector on the next inspection.
