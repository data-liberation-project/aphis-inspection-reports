2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A portion of the barrier fence located on the left side at the opossum exhibit previously consisted of dense
impassable vegetation. On todays' inspection, a portion of this vegetation is no longer dense allowing this inspector
to easily pass through this area and easily gain access to the opossum enclosure from the public walkway.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
This barrier shall be made so it is not easily passable by the public to assure the safety of the animal and the public.
