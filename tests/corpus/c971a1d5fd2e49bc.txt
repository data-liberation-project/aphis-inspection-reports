HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The ceiling in the Goeldi's monkey enclosure is in need of repair. There are areas of the ceiling between the sky
lights and the front screen where the paint is missing exposing the material below. These areas are not capable of
being readily cleaned and sanitized which may lead to an increase in disease transmission. All surfaces of indoor
housing facilities must be maintained to ensure surfaces are capable of being readily cleaned and sanitized.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are places where facilities are not maintained in good repair. The wire mesh used around the wooden posts
in the camel holding area has been pulled away in some places and there are wire points present in other places.
Also there is portion of a cattle-type panel in the sloth bear enclosure with wire points present at approximately 6
inches from the ground. One wooden step missing from the African lion elevated platform in the east lion yard. Due
to it missing has resulted in one bolt to become exposed. These areas could result in injury to the animals present
in these enclosures. All facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect animals from injury. Correct by 2
October 2014.
There are metal surfaces in the indoor portion of the river otter's enclosure that are rusted which is resulting in the
bubbling and flaking of the paint. Metal that is rusted may no longer be structurally sound nor may it be capable of
being cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces must be maintained in good repair to be structurally sound and be
capable of being cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 18 October 2014.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Some water from the cleaning of the floor of the gaur's shelter enclosure is being pushed outside to the edge of the
concrete landing. This is resulting in standing water and mud accumulating where the animals must walk through it
to access the shelter enclosure. Standing water and mud may cause pest problems, an increase in odors and
disease. A suitable method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water to prevent it from accumulating inthe walk-ways of the animals. Correct by 25 Sept. 2014.

WATERING.
The river otter exhibit uses a dive pool for potable water for the 2 otters when they are on exhibit. At the time of the
inspection, the sand filter for the pool was not functioning and the water was very turbid and full of debris and would
not considered to be safe for drinking.
The otters are accustomed to swimming in and drinking this water and, until this filtration failure can be fixed, they
need to have another source of potable water provided to them on exhibit or have access to the back area where
potable water is available.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Accumulations of cobwebs in several of the off-exhibit areas were noted during the inspection:
**Back holding area for 1 male snow leopard and 2 Amur leopards has an unfinished ceiling with exposed insulation
and numerous cobwebs along the tops of the enclosures, around the shift gates, and along the rafters and lights.
The unfinished ceiling reduces the ability to hose and clean the areas above the enclosures.
**Sloth bears back holding area had cobwebs formed around the keeper doors and shift mechanism. A spider web
in the outdoor exhibit was also noted.
**The back holding areas for elephants and for the giraffes had cobwebs hanging above the hay storage.
**The back holding area for a male red panda had cobwebs around the top of the enclosure.
**The back holding area for a Baird tapir and a giant anteater had accumulations around the enclosures.
Cobwebs are evidence of pest activities and act to collect dust, debris, and aerosolized material. These should be
removed when noted to minimize the risk to the animals for exposure to pests and aerosolized materials that may
carry infectious organisms and may contaminate food and water.
Cobwebs should be removed from all animal and food storage areas by 25 Sept. 2014.
The ceiling in the snow leopard and Amur leopard back holding area should have the exposed insulation covered to
minimize contamination and facilitate better housekeeping. Correct by 31 Dec. 2014.
This routine inspection was conducted with the zoo Curator on 17 Sept. 2014. The exit interview was conducted on
18 Sept. 2014.Additional Inspectors
