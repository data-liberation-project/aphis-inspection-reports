HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were several areas in and around the kennel building that need attention. The outside portion of the kennel
building, the wash down areas have several days of accumulations of waste in them. Allowing the waste matter to
buildup can create areas for flies and other vermin that could adversely affect the health and well-being of the dogs.
One outdoor enclosure with a light tan Labrador retriever pup has several days of fecal matter accumulated on the
ground. The shelter provided for the pup had areas of wood around the door that are not impervious to moisture.
The shelter building had a buildup of mud and waste on it that must be routinely cleaned and sanitized every ten
days or more often if needed.
Inside of the kennel building the enclosures had buildup of hair and dust inside of them. The floors had a buildup of
dirt and other debris on them. The walls floors and enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized routinely to protect the
health and well-being of the dogs. Providing a clean and sanitized environment for the dogs will help to protect the
dogs from disease and other health hazards and help to ensure their health and well-being.
Licensee must thoroughly clean and sanitize all areas of the kennel building inside and out. The Labrador pups
enclosure must be cleaned and all surfaces in contact with the dog be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized. To be
